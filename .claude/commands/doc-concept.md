Create conceptual documentation following DITA-style concept topic structure.

Generate comprehensive conceptual documentation that includes:

1. **Overview**: High-level explanation of what this concept is
2. **Context**: When and why this concept is relevant
3. **Key Components**: Break down the main elements or aspects
4. **Relationships**: How this concept relates to other concepts in the system
5. **Use Cases**: Common scenarios where this concept applies
6. **Benefits/Considerations**: Advantages and important considerations

Structure the content with:
- Clear headings and subheadings
- Logical flow from general to specific
- Cross-references to related task and reference documentation
- Examples where helpful for understanding

Focus on the "what" and "why" rather than step-by-step procedures.
