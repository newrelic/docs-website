Create task-oriented documentation following DITA-style task topic structure.

Generate step-by-step procedural documentation that includes:

1. **Purpose**: Brief statement of what the task accomplishes
2. **Prerequisites**: Required knowledge, permissions, or setup needed
3. **Context**: When you would perform this task
4. **Procedure**: Clear, numbered steps with:
   - Action verbs starting each step
   - Expected results or confirmations
   - Code examples, commands, or UI interactions
   - Screenshots or diagrams where helpful
5. **Verification**: How to confirm the task was completed successfully
6. **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions
7. **Next Steps**: What to do after completing this task

Structure with:
- Scannable numbered or bulleted lists
- Clear action-oriented language
- Consistent formatting for code, UI elements, and file paths
- Cross-references to related concept and reference documentation

Focus on the "how" with clear, actionable instructions.
