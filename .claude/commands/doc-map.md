Create a documentation map or content organization structure following DITA-style map principles.

Generate a hierarchical content organization that includes:

1. **Content Inventory**: Survey existing documentation and identify gaps
2. **Topic Hierarchy**: Organize content into logical groups:
   - Getting Started / Introduction
   - Concepts (understanding)
   - Tasks (procedures)
   - Reference (lookup)
   - Troubleshooting
   - Advanced Topics
3. **Content Relationships**: Define how topics relate to each other
4. **Navigation Structure**: Logical flow and pathways through content
5. **Metadata Strategy**: Consistent tagging and categorization
6. **Content Reuse Plan**: Identify reusable components and snippets

Create:
- Table of contents with hierarchical structure
- Content matrix showing topic types and audiences
- Cross-reference map showing relationships between topics
- Templates and style guide recommendations
- Content maintenance and update procedures

Focus on creating a cohesive, navigable documentation ecosystem that serves different user needs and experience levels.
