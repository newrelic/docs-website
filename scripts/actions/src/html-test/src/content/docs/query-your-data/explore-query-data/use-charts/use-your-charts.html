<p>Once created, you can customize the appearance of your chart to best present the data. You can share a chart in different formats and add a chart to a new or existing dashboard.</p>
<h2>Change the appearance of your chart [#change-appearance]</h2>
<p>When you run your query in <strong>advanced (NRQL) mode</strong> or view your chart while using <strong>basic mode</strong> to specify data, the query builder analyzes your data and applies a <a href="/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/insights-chart-types">chart type</a> that fits your data.</p>
<p>You can select another chart type that you prefer — your chart should tell the story that you want to communicate. Some chart types may not be available due to the nature of the data you specified.</p>
<p>To change the appearance of your chart, use the <strong>Chart type</strong> menu to the right of the current chart. Each type in the list has a tooltip with information about using that type.</p>

<h2>Chart share and view options [#share-charts]</h2>
<p>Most charts have various options, including a chart-embed option, getting a chart as an image, and adding a chart to a dashboard. To read about general chart options, see <a href="/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/new-relic-one-core-ui-components">Basic UI features</a>.</p>
