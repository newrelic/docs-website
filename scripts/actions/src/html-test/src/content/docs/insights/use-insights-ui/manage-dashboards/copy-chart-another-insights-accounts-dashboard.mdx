If your company uses multiple New Relic accounts across teams, you can add charts to other account dashboards for a more complete understanding of your company's data.

## Requirements and permissions [#requirements]

In order to add a chart to another account you must:

* Ensure the target dashboard is set to **Editable by others in my account**.
* Be a registered user on the target account.

<Callout variant="tip">
  You can [add users via the UI](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/add-update-users) or [via the partnership user API call](/docs/accounts-partnerships/partnerships/partner-api/partnership-api-user-object).
</Callout>

Users in the target account can:

* View the query (if dashboard is set to **Viewable by others**).
* View and edit the query (if dashboard is set to **Editable by others in my account**).

If the user viewing the target dashboard is not registered as a user in the source account, the chart does not load.

## Add a chart to another account's dashboard [#add]

<Callout variant="tip">
  You can also select the source account from the account switcher in the query tool to query the source account's data and copy the resulting chart to a dashboard.
</Callout>

To add a chart to another account's dashboard:

1. Ensure the [requirements](#requirements) are met.
2. Run your NRQL query, copy an existing chart, or select **Add to an Insights dashboard** under an existing UI chart.
3. From the **Copy chart** modal, select the account dropdown at the top.
4. Search for and select the target account's dashboard where you want to add your chart.
5. Select **Copy**.
