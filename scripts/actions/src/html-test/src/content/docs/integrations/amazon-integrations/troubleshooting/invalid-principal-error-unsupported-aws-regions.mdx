## Problem

When connecting [AWS to a New Relic Infrastructure integration](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/get-started/connect-aws-services-infrastructure#connect), during the **Review** phase, you receive the AWS error `Invalid principal in policy`.

## Solution

Check the type of integration you want to install. New Relic can obtain monitoring data from services and endpoints that are located in all [AWS regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html "Link opens in a new window.") except from China regions.

You will see this error when trying to configure integrations from an account that uses China.
