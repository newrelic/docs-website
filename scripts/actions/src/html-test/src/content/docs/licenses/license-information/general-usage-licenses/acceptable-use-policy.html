<p>New Relic’s mission is to instrument, measure and improve the internet to help our customers create more perfect software, experiences and businesses.</p>
<p>We strive to keep our resources operating efficiently, so our services are available to all subscribers. Because you have access to shared resources, we have put these rules in place to ensure everyone has a great experience. For example, you as a tenant would not want other tenants to engage in the types of activities described below.</p>
<p>To help us do this, we have put some rules in place regarding your use of the <strong>New Relic Properties</strong> and created this Acceptable Use Policy (“<strong>AUP</strong>”).</p>
<p>This AUP applies if you use any New Relic product, service, software, website, forum, page or system (collectively, the “<strong>New Relic Properties</strong>”) and is part of the New Relic documentation, which can be found at <a href="https://docs.newrelic.com">https://docs.newrelic.com</a> (the “<strong>Documentation</strong>”).</p>
<h3>You will not, and not to allow third parties, in connection with your use of the New Relic Properties to: [#not-allow-third-parties]</h3>

    <p>We will occasionally need to modify this AUP to help us continue to provide you with a great experience while using the New Relic Properties. In the event we modify this AUP, we will do so by posting a revised version, and any changes will be effective immediately if you’re a new user of the New Relic Properties and thirty (30) days after posting for all other users. If you continue using the New Relic Properties after we update this AUP, you agree to the latest version of this AUP.</p>
    <p>You can report a violation of this AUP to: <a href="mailto:AUP@newrelic.com">AUP@newrelic.com</a>. Or by mail at:</p>

    <p>This AUP, and our customers’ compliance with it, is essential for enabling us to provide you and our other customers with the New Relic Properties, which we take very seriously. You are wholly and solely responsible for appropriate configuration of systems and software that you own or can control to ensure your compliance with this AUP. So, if we determine in our sole discretion that you have violated this AUP, we may, without limiting any other remedies available to us, permanently or temporarily suspend, limit, or terminate your access to the New Relic Properties without notice or liability. This right applies even if the breach is unintentional or unauthorized if we believe that any such suspension, limitation, or termination is necessary to ensure compliance with laws, or to protect the rights, safety, privacy, security, or property of us or others.</p>
    <p>In this AUP, the term “content” means: (1) any information, data, text, software, code, scripts, music, sound, photos, graphics, videos, messages, tags, interactive features, or other materials that you post, upload, share, submit, or otherwise provide in any manner to the services and (2) any other materials, content, or data you provide to New Relic or use with the New Relic Properties.
