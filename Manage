New Relic’s powerful database, NRDB, gathers all your telemetry data in one place, gives you a connected view of all your data, and scales as your business grows.
We invite you to send all your metrics, events, logs, and traces to NRDB, including those from third-party sources. But we also recognize that some data might not be necessary for your business goals. You shouldn’t have to wade through data you don’t need to get to the data you do. And you definitely shouldn’t have to pay for it. That’s where our data management tools come in: they let you decide what data you send to New Relic and how long it should be stored.

Coupled with user management tools, data management helps you get maximum value from your investment in New Relic, all while safeguarding your data.
