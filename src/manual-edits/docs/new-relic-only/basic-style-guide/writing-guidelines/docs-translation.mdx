New Relic documentation exists on these sites:

* [**docs.newrelic.com**](https://docs.newrelic.com): English
* [**docs.newrelic.co.jp**](https://docs.newrelic.co.jp): Japanese

## Toggle between Docs sites

The Japanese site contains the same docs as the English site. However, as of January 2019, only a selected set of docs have been translated.

Every doc on both sites includes a **Language** dropdown to toggle between the two sites. If a doc has not yet been translated, it still appears on the Japanese site in English.

![Language toggle](./images/japanese-english-toggle.png "Language toggle")

To toggle between English ([**docs.newrelic.com**](https://docs.newrelic.com)) and Japanese ([**docs.newrelic.co.jp**](https://docs.newrelic.co.jp)) on any page, select the **Language** dropdown.

## View translation status

Anyone at New Relic can view a doc's translation status after they log in to the Docs site from their Okta login page. You must have **Admin** privileges on the Drupal Docs site to change a doc's translation status.

Depending on how individual docs were originally created, they may have a **Translation info** section:

* Docs created as a **Basic page** or **Troubleshooting** doc type includes a **Translation info** section.
* Release notes, API nodes, and attribute definitions do not.

In Drupal edit mode, you can view the doc's current translation status.

    To view a **specific** doc's translation status:

    1. From your New Relic Okta login, select the `Docs` tile, then navigate to the doc.
    2. Select the doc's `Edit` button.
    3. Scroll to the doc's **Translation info** section.
    4. When finished, select **Cancel**. (Do not select **Save**.)

## Request translation

New Relic uses a translation services company to translate docs. The original contract in 2018 approved 200 key docs specifically selected for the Japanese market only. Additional requests to translate docs require budget approval from the translation project team and the New Relic sales manager for Japan. Requests for other markets and languages will be addressed in the future.

To request a doc for translation:

1. Make sure the doc meets criteria for translation, such as:
   * High traffic, particularly for that audience
   * Strategic importance to company
   * Introductory and conceptual docs that tell a valuable story about the product or feature
   * Demonstrated customer interest in that market (for example, the Windows/.NET stack is particularly important in Japan)
   * Allows us to tell a "complete" story (for example, including all installation docs for a particular language so we can offer a complete experience)
2. [File a DOC JIRA](http://docs.newrelic.com/jira) outlining your business case.

The Tech Docs team will follow up with you for additional details, forward your request to the translation project team, and notify you when your doc has been translated.

## Update translated doc

Every two weeks the translation services company automatically runs a program that compares changes between the English and Japanese sites. If a translated doc has changes, typically it will be re-translated. If budget considerations affect updates to a translated doc, the translation project team will work with the Tech Docs team and the requester to approve and prioritize the update.

## Analyze traffic to translated docs

To track traffic on the Japanese Docs site, use any of these options:

* [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/?hl=en&pli=1#/realtime/rt-overview/a3047412w51432103p183513476/)
* [Insights dashboard](https://insights.newrelic.com/accounts/727059/dashboards/807464)

## View CSAT for translated docs

Like the English Docs site, the Japanese Docs site includes the option to submit customer satisfaction `Yes/No` votes and comments. To view CSAT results for a translated doc, use either of these options:

* [Drupal CSAT page](https://docs.newrelic.com/node/5726/webform-results/table)
* [Insights dashboard](https://insights.newrelic.com/accounts/727059/dashboards/807464)

To translate any comments submitted, use any basic translation tool. For example:

1. Go to [Google](https://www.google.com), then type `translate` in the Google search box.
2. Paste the text you want to be translated into Google's `Detect language` text box.

## Show SEO status for translated docs

The Drupal site's front end uses the doc's [translation status](translation-status) information to display the SEO `hreflang` element for a page. This tells search engines that the page also has a version available in the specific language.

```
<link rel="alternate" href="https://docs.newrelic.co.jp" hreflang="ja" />
```

OneLink uses this page element to decide whether to display the link in English (if no Japanese version exists) or in Japanese (if that version exists).
