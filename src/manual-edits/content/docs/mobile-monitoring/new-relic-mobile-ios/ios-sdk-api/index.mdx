New Relic Mobile has an SDK API to customize how New Relic monitors your app. For example, use methods in the **NewRelic** object to [send custom attributes and events](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/adding-querying-data/custom-attributes-events-new-relic-mobile) for your iOS app to New Relic Insights.

Here are all the methods in this API. For more information, see the [New Relic iOS SDK API guide](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/install-configure/work-ios-sdk-api).
