title: Add a What's New? post
---

New Relic uses *What's new?* posts as product announcements to let our customers know about new features and updates in the [New Relic One](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/jerome.plg-whats-new-launcher?pane=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJqZXJvbWUucGxnLXdoYXRzLW5ldyJ9). You can also find *What's new?* announcements on our [Docs site](https://docs.newrelic.com/whats-new).

To add a new post:

1. If the post doesn't exist, create the folder for the current year and month in the [`src/content/whats-new/`](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/tree/develop/src/content/whats-new) directory (for example, `src/content/whats-new/2020/12` for December 2020). 
  
  <Callout variant="tip">
  The year and month definition determine where to place the post in the navigation on the [Docs site](https://docs.newrelic.com/whats-new).
  </Callout>

2. Create a markdown file (`.md`) in the correct year and month directory 

  <Callout variant="important">
  This is _not_ a MDX file.
  </Callout>

3. Using the table and example below, add the correct frontmatter to the top of your markdown file. The entries should be between a set of three hyphen symbols (`---`) to mark it as a frontmatter content block.

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th style="width:200px">Field</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead> 
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>`template` </td>
        <td>This value should _always_ be `whatsNew` for what's new posts</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>`title` </td>
        <td>The title of the post.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>`summary` </td>
        <td>A short summary of the post.  A single sentence of about 10-20 words.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>`releaseDate` </td>
        <td>The date of the post in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` (for example, `2020-12-05` for December 5, 2020).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>`learnMoreLink` </td>
        <td>A link to learn more about the feature being announced (for example, a link to the blog).</td>
      </tr>
       <tr>     
        <td>`getStartedLink` </td>
        <td>A link to a relevant documentation site post.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
