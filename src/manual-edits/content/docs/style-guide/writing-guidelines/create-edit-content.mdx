If you'd like to edit a doc, click **Edit this page**. On GitHub, edit the file and submit your pull request. A member of the Tech Docs team will review your edit and publish your changes. We'll follow up with you if we have any questions.

<Callout variant="important">
  If your draft needs to be released on a specific date or within a specific timeframe (for example, right before a release), contact the Tech Docs `@hero` in the `#documentation` Slack channel. If you're not a New Relic employee, please [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/newrelic/docs-website/issues/new/choose).

For detailed information about how to work with the Tech Docs team, see the [Docs starter kit in NerdLife](https://nerdlife.datanerd.us/new-relic/our-departments/product/experience-design/docs-starter-kit). (Internal New Relic link)

## Edit and publish existing content [#editing-existing]

To edit existing content in the Drupal Docs site:

1. Find a doc you'd like to edit.
2. Click **Edit this page**.
3. Make your changes. 
4. Write a meaningful commit message and description, then commit your change.
5. Create your pull request.

A member of the Tech Docs team will let you know when we've published your changes. The time needed to publish is based on [our SLAs](https://nerdlife.datanerd.us/new-relic/our-departments/product/experience-design/docs-starter-kit#jive_content_id_When_should_you_contact_us). (Internal New Relic link)

## Create new docs [#creating-docs]

You can use [article templates](/docs/new-relic-only/tech-writer-style-guide/article-templates) or [clone an existing doc](#clone-doc) as a template. To create a new doc:

1. Clone the repo on your computer.
2. In `/src/content/docs/`, find a good location for your doc.
3. Using your text editor, create a new `.mdx` file or copy an existing doc.
4. Write your content.
5. Commit your changes and create a pull request.

The Tech Docs team has two heroes watching for new pull requests. We'll help you get the content finalized and make sure that it's in the right place.

## Clone (copy) an existing doc [#clone-doc]

Once you've cloned the `docs-website` repository, use your text editor to copy an existing doc. Rename and edit the copy and then save it as a new doc.

If you want your cloned doc to be translated, follow standard procedures to [request translation](/docs/new-relic-only/basic-style-guide/writing-guidelines/manage-translated-docs#request-translation).

Your cloned doc automatically inherits the original doc's frontmatter content. Make sure to change that, too.

## Request a future publication date [#hold-for-release]

For docs work related to unreleased features, please use our [private repo](https://github.com/newrelic/private-docs-site).

If you create a new doc and submit a pull request in the private Docs repo and then contact the Tech Docs `@hero` in the [#documentation Slack channel](https://newrelic.slack.com/messages/documentation/).

The Tech Docs hero will follow up with you to get any additional details needed so that we can get this content published at the right time.

## Add or update license documentation [#license-docs]

To add or update New Relic license information, follow [standard procedures](#editing-workflow) to add or update documentation in the appropriate [**Licenses** category](/docs/licenses) on the [Docs site](https://docs.newrelic.com).
