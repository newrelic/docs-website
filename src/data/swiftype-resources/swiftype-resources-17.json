      "body": "Taking some time to consider your headings and document titles will be time well spent. Titles and headings are not only important for search results, but they can make your docs easier to skim. For all headings and document titles, use sentence case. Use parallel construction Use parallel construction when naming headers. For example, use all nouns (\"Organization,\" \"Tone\"), all verbs (\"Create,\" \"Delete\"), etc. Keep it short, avoid -ing words For all headers, keep the title as short as possible. In particular, avoid headers that are more than a line long. As with all our writing, you should feel free to address the reader directly: Install the agent, for example, rather than Agent installation. You should also avoid -ing words, which add to character count without contributing clarity. Do not use h1 headings After you publish your doc, the docs site will automatically use what you added to the Title field as the doc's level one heading (h1). To ensure that your doc is properly indexed for search, do not manually create additional h1 headings. If your doc's title is long and you would like a shorter title to appear in the sidebar menu, create a GitHub issue and we'll help you with that change. Use level two headings to identify chunks of information Organize chunks of information into sections with level two headings (##). For example: ## Create a new user [#create-new-user] Copy Important If you don't specify an ID manually, the site will use your header text as that header's ID (also known as anchor link). Create a manual ID to preserve links to that header if you change the header text. If you have too many level sections, consider splitting the document into multiple pages. Avoid using level three headings Avoid using ### headings unless it makes sense for the content or if the content is lengthy. Collapsers, tables, and other structural elements are often a better choice. Be particularly careful about level three headings that make a level two section longer than a single screen height. Here are two examples of good scenarios for using level three headings: Example #1: Events-to-metrics API doc Example #2: Infrastructure integration doc",

      "body": "Callouts direct your attention to information of special importance or to information that doesn't fit smoothly into the main text. Consider your reader. If your doc has too many callouts, it might confuse your reader about what matters the most and distract them from what does. Use your callouts judiciously. Recommendation: Skim the complete doc. If there are too many callouts, decide which ones can be removed. Types of callouts Here's an example of the callout format: <Callout variant=\"tip\"> Your tip text goes here. It can have multiple paragraphs. </Callout> Copy On our docs site, we use these callout classes: Caution (callout-caution) Cautions scream at you that this could cause a crash or cost you data loss beyond the task at hand. Cautions use the callout-caution class. At a traffic light, a Caution would be red. Caution Avoid disabling auto-transaction naming, because metric grouping issues will likely occur. Instead, use API calls to name your transactions. Important (callout-important) Important notes urge awareness that this could impair the task at hand or cost you time if you ignore the text. Important notes use the callout-important class. At a traffic light, an Important note would be yellow. Important Custom events sent via the agent API are not compatible with high security mode. Tip (callout-tip) Tips whisper to you that this is nice to know, like a shortcut, best practice, or reminder, but is unnecessary to complete the task at hand. Tips use the callout-tip class. At a traffic light, a Tip would be a green light. Tip If you have integrated your New Relic account with a ticketing system such as Lighthouse, Pivotal Tracker, or Atlassian JIRA, you can use the note to file a ticket or story. User-related permissions For recommended wording, see User-related language and styles. Pricing (callout-pricing) Do not use. Pricing callouts let you know that you may need a specific subscription level in order to access the product or feature. Pricing callouts use the callout-pricing class. Typically, pricing callouts appear in the intro of a doc. See the example below for standard verbiage in the callout. With the new pricing model, these are rarely used. Tip Access to this feature depends on your subscription level. Custom callouts Custom callouts are available for special cases, such as beta docs. Here's what you can control with custom callouts: Title text: Change the callout label by inserting the title attribute like this: title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\". When you publish, this field is automatically converted to all capital letters. Color: The color is limited to the color of the variant you include, or if you don't include a variant, you get the default border color (blue-grey). Here is what the code looks like: <Callout variant=\"caution\" title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\"> Your callout message goes here! </Callout> Copy For beta docs, add a custom callout. Also, we recommend that you don't include a variant so you display the default color: Beta feature This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! Avoid callout fatigue Callout fatigue is what happens when there are too many callouts on a doc. A single callout is a great way to draw attention to important information, but the more callouts there are, the more likely it is that your reader won't read the callouts. Keep these things in mind when you're working with callouts: If you add a callout, remove a callout. Wherever possible, don't increase the number of callouts. Do not use stacked callouts. Stacked callouts are two or more callouts that follow directly one after another. Not only do not use these, but if you see this in a doc, take a few minutes to break these callouts up. Remove outdated callouts. As you're going through the docs site, if you see a callout that's outdated, for whatever reason, take a few minutes to delete it from the doc. Be stingy in your use of important and warning callouts. If we use important and warning callouts too often, they lose their effectiveness. Stacked callouts example Here's an example of the stacked callouts we'd love to avoid. Tip The more callouts there are, the more difficult it is to spot the information that's important. Important Not everything is important enough to put in a callout. Caution Think carefully before adding another callout on the page.",

You can use the <code>, <pre>, and <var> tags to indicate \"raw\" technical content such as excerpts from a config file, an API method name, or a file path. For inline code or data (<code>) To surround small blocks of code or data (single words or lines), mark as code: Source: Use <code> tags. Markdown: Surround the text with backtick ` characters. For multi-line code blocks (<pre>) To surround longer blocks of data that run multiple lines, mark as preformatted text: Source: Use <pre> tags. Markdown: Do not use Markdown-style indented code formatting, as this can cause unexpected formatting problems. Highlight user input with <var> Use the <var> tag to highlight areas of a code block where a user is expected to supply their own value. For more context on when to use <var> tags, see < var> formatting guidelines. Follow these guidelines when you use <var> tags: Address the reader directly Use all caps and underscores _ to separate words (also known as SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE). Don't use other punctuation (such as wrapping the text in angle brackets). Exception: REST API examples use a ${VARNAME} syntax inspired by Bash conventions. Standard examples: echo \"license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" | sudo tee -a /etc/newrelic-infra.yml Copy msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\newrelic-infra.msi Copy https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/applications/APP_ID Copy REST API v2 example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.xml\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=HttpDispatcher&values[]=average_call_time&values[]=call_count&from=2014-03-01T20:59:00+00:00&to=2014-03-01T21:59:00+00:00&summarize=true' Copy Highlight important sections with <mark> Use the <mark> tag to highlight areas of a code block that are particularly important. Most commonly, <mark> is used to highlight New Relic API methods in sample code that contains a lot of \"other logic.\" When you use <mark>, you should usually follow the code block with a list of bullets that explain what each API call is doing and link to method syntax. For more context on when to use <mark> tags, see < mark> formatting guidelines. Examples: Example of using the <mark> tag private void storeItem(long id) { Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). startSegment(\"storeItem\") ; segment. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters .product(\"H2\") .collection(null) .operation(\"insert\") .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) .databaseName(\"test\") .build()) ; // fire and forget DB_POOL.submit(() -> { segment.end() ; insertData(id); }); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: startSegment(...): Begins the segment that will time the code. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters()): Associates the time with a datastore external call This will show up in APM with datastore data. For more information, see reportAsExternal API. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. segment.end(): Stops timing this segment. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. Add syntax highlighting To add syntax highlighting to a code block, add class=\"highlight\" to the <pre> tag. The syntax highlighter tries to auto-detect the language. If it's not working as expected, ensure the language is supported and specify the language by adding the a lang-LANG-NAME class (for example: lang-html). View a full list of supported languages for syntax highlighting. Element colors and themes are fully customizable. Link to other docs You can add <a href> tags inside a <pre> blocks, just as you would any other content. However, make sure to use them judiciously since they can be easy to miss. A good example is the Infrastructure config file template, where each config element links to the relevant section of the main config doc.",

      "body": "Callouts direct your attention to information of special importance or to information that doesn't fit smoothly into the main text. Consider your reader. If your doc has too many callouts, it might confuse your reader about what matters the most and distract them from what does. Use your callouts judiciously. Recommendation: Skim the complete doc. If there are too many callouts, decide which ones can be removed. Types of callouts Here's an example of the callout format: <Callout variant=\"tip\"> Your tip text goes here. It can have multiple paragraphs. </Callout> Copy On our docs site, we use these callout classes: Caution (callout-caution) Cautions scream at you that this could cause a crash or cost you data loss beyond the task at hand. Cautions use the callout-caution class. At a traffic light, a Caution would be red. Caution Avoid disabling auto-transaction naming, because metric grouping issues will likely occur. Instead, use API calls to name your transactions. Important (callout-important) Important notes urge awareness that this could impair the task at hand or cost you time if you ignore the text. Important notes use the callout-important class. At a traffic light, an Important note would be yellow. Important Custom events sent via the agent API are not compatible with high security mode. Tip (callout-tip) Tips whisper to you that this is nice to know, like a shortcut, best practice, or reminder, but is unnecessary to complete the task at hand. Tips use the callout-tip class. At a traffic light, a Tip would be a green light. Tip If you have integrated your New Relic account with a ticketing system such as Lighthouse, Pivotal Tracker, or Atlassian JIRA, you can use the note to file a ticket or story. User-related permissions For recommended wording, see User-related language and styles. Pricing (callout-pricing) Do not use. Pricing callouts let you know that you may need a specific subscription level in order to access the product or feature. Pricing callouts use the callout-pricing class. Typically, pricing callouts appear in the intro of a doc. See the example below for standard verbiage in the callout. With the new pricing model, these are rarely used. Tip Access to this feature depends on your subscription level. Custom callouts Custom callouts are available for special cases, such as beta docs. Here's what you can control with custom callouts: Title text: Change the callout label by inserting the title attribute like this: title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\". When you publish, this field is automatically converted to all capital letters. Color: The color is limited to the color of the variant you include, or if you don't include a variant, you get the default border color (blue-grey). Here is what the code looks like: <Callout variant=\"caution\" title=\"YOUR CUSTOM TITLE\"> Your callout message goes here! </Callout> Copy For beta docs, add a custom callout. Also, we recommend that you don't include a variant so you display the default color: Beta feature This feature is still in development, but we encourage you to try it out! Avoid callout fatigue Callout fatigue is what happens when there are too many callouts on a doc. A single callout is a great way to draw attention to important information, but the more callouts there are, the more likely it is that your reader won't read the callouts. Keep these things in mind when you're working with callouts: If you add a callout, remove a callout. Wherever possible, don't increase the number of callouts. Do not use stacked callouts. Stacked callouts are two or more callouts that follow directly one after another. Not only do not use these, but if you see this in a doc, take a few minutes to break these callouts up. Remove outdated callouts. As you're going through the docs site, if you see a callout that's outdated, for whatever reason, take a few minutes to delete it from the doc. Be stingy in your use of important and warning callouts. If we use important and warning callouts too often, they lose their effectiveness. Stacked callouts example Here's an example of the stacked callouts we'd love to avoid. Tip The more callouts there are, the more difficult it is to spot the information that's important. Important Not everything is important enough to put in a callout. Caution Think carefully before adding another callout on the page.",

      "body": "We use a variety of formatting to highlight code or other technical language. You can use the <code>, <pre>, and <var> tags to indicate \"raw\" technical content such as excerpts from a config file, an API method name, or a file path. For inline code or data (<code>) To surround small blocks of code or data (single words or lines), mark as code: Source: Use <code> tags. Markdown: Surround the text with backtick ` characters. For multi-line code blocks (<pre>) To surround longer blocks of data that run multiple lines, mark as preformatted text: Source: Use <pre> tags. Markdown: Do not use Markdown-style indented code formatting, as this can cause unexpected formatting problems. Highlight user input with <var> Use the <var> tag to highlight areas of a code block where a user is expected to supply their own value. For more context on when to use <var> tags, see < var> formatting guidelines. Follow these guidelines when you use <var> tags: Address the reader directly Use all caps and underscores _ to separate words (also known as SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE). Don't use other punctuation (such as wrapping the text in angle brackets). Exception: REST API examples use a ${VARNAME} syntax inspired by Bash conventions. Standard examples: echo \"license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" | sudo tee -a /etc/newrelic-infra.yml Copy msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\newrelic-infra.msi Copy https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/applications/APP_ID Copy REST API v2 example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.xml\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=HttpDispatcher&values[]=average_call_time&values[]=call_count&from=2014-03-01T20:59:00+00:00&to=2014-03-01T21:59:00+00:00&summarize=true' Copy Highlight important sections with <mark> Use the <mark> tag to highlight areas of a code block that are particularly important. Most commonly, <mark> is used to highlight New Relic API methods in sample code that contains a lot of \"other logic.\" When you use <mark>, you should usually follow the code block with a list of bullets that explain what each API call is doing and link to method syntax. For more context on when to use <mark> tags, see < mark> formatting guidelines. Examples: Example of using the <mark> tag private void storeItem(long id) { Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). startSegment(\"storeItem\") ; segment. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters .product(\"H2\") .collection(null) .operation(\"insert\") .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) .databaseName(\"test\") .build()) ; // fire and forget DB_POOL.submit(() -> { segment.end() ; insertData(id); }); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: startSegment(...): Begins the segment that will time the code. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters()): Associates the time with a datastore external call This will show up in APM with datastore data. For more information, see reportAsExternal API. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. segment.end(): Stops timing this segment. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. Add syntax highlighting To add syntax highlighting to a code block, add class=\"highlight\" to the <pre> tag. The syntax highlighter tries to auto-detect the language. If it's not working as expected, ensure the language is supported and specify the language by adding the a lang-LANG-NAME class (for example: lang-html). View a full list of supported languages for syntax highlighting. Element colors and themes are fully customizable. Link to other docs You can add <a href> tags inside a <pre> blocks, just as you would any other content. However, make sure to use them judiciously since they can be easy to miss. A good example is the Infrastructure config file template, where each config element links to the relevant section of the main config doc.",

      "body": "This document will guide you through the entire workflow for editing the New Relic documentation site as a New Relic Tech Docs Writer. Resources VSCode (or another text editor) VSCode has great GitHub integrations GitHub account GitHub Desktop Edit in the GitHub web editor vs local build Need to edit a doc? Use this table to decide where to work! Use the GitHub web editor for: Use the local build for: Adding content to one doc: Rewriting sentences, or 1-2 lines Editing small amounts of content: updating URLs, deleting typos, etc. Brand new docs Rewrites of more than 1 or 2 lines Any updates to doc frontmatter Title changes Taxonomy changes Metadescription updates Redirects Updating images Editing multiple docs at once Continue reading for instructions on how to edit a doc locally. 1. Set up your local environment Running the site locally makes testing and previewing large changes much easier. Here's how to get setup: Install GitHub Desktop Sign in to GitHub Desktop. On Macs, click on GitHub Desktop in the top left corner of your screen and select Preferences. Select the blue Sign In button and follow the prompts in the browser window. Navigate to the Docs Site repository on GitHub.com. Click the green Code button and then select Open with GitHub Desktop. Choose the location where you want the repo, and this will clone the entire repository to your local machine at the designated path. You can ensure the repo was cloned by navigating to your local GitHub folder (the default is ~/Documents/github). Once you have cloned the repo, you don't need to clone it again in the future. 2. Run the site locally Build the site locally using the terminal to preview changes before opening a Pull Request. While it's highly recommended to build the site locally, this is technically an optional step. The site will automatically reflect any local changes once build. Node and Yarn are tools used to build the site on your local machine. Prerequisites Install Node Install Yarn npm install -g yarn Build the site In your terminal, go to your cloned repo, docs-website. For example: cd ~/Documents/github/docs-website Run yarn with the following commands: yarn && yarn start The site will take a few minutes to build. Make yourself some tea or coffee. Once it's built, you can access your preview site in your browser by navigating to http://localhost:8000/ 3. Edit a doc Once your local environment and branch are set up, you're ready to edit a doc. Check out the style guide for writing guidelines. First, ensure your Current Branch in GitHub Desktop is set to the correct branch, not Develop. Navigate to the doc you want to edit in Finder. If I wanted to edit a Python agent doc, I would navigate to: ~/Documents/github/docs-website/src/content/docs/agents/python-agent/hosting-services/python-agent-stackato.mdx Edit the doc in your text editor of choice. You should write docs in markdown language. Reference the style guide for help with formatting markdown Save the file with your edits, then follow the same process for any other docs you wish to edit. 4. Commit your changes Once your edits are done, you can commit them. This stages your changes, which you will later push upstream to Github. By pushing your changes, everyone will have access to your branch and commits. Navigate to GitHub Desktop. The left column should have a record of all the edits you have made to docs. In the bottom left corner, name your commit and add a good description of your edits. It should be descriptive enough to ensure that someone can understand all the changes made by simply scanning this description. Click Commit to [yourbranchname] 5. Publish your commits Once you have committed your changes, you're almost ready to open your Pull Request. First, you need to ensure your branch is pushed upstream. On GitHub desktop, click the blue Publish Branch button if available. If you don't see the Publish Branch, click the blue Push Origin button. This will push all your commits upstream and make them available to everyone else through the GitHub repository. 6. Open your pull request Now that your commits are available to everyone, you need to notify people that your changes are ready to be merged into the develop branch. To do this, you open a pull request: On GitHub Desktop, click the blue Create Pull Request button. This will open GitHub in your browser, and prompt you to fill in your pull request. Ensure you're merging from your branch into either the main or develop branch. If you scroll down, you can review all your commits to ensure they reflect all your changes. Just like your commit description, your pull request description should be detailed and give the full context of your changes. Feel free to add any additional context here (issue or Jira number, SMEs, etc.) To request a review from another Tech Writer: in GitHub open the PR, navigate to the Conversation section, and then select or type in a reviewer name in the Reviewer section. Add any relevant labels to your PR. If you do not add from_tw, the PR will not be automatically assigned to another writer for review. Once you're satisfied with your pull request, click the green Create pull request button. You can either publish the changes directly by approving the pull request yourself, or you can request for another Tech Writer to peer edit it. At the bottom of the pull request page, you will see a Checks section. These checks ensure your PR doesn't break the build process of the site. Ensure all checks marked required pass before merging. Once the pull request has passed the checks and it has been approved by another tech writer (or you are confident the changes are ready to be published), click the green Merge pull request button. This will merge your branch and commits into the repository and will begin the build process. If you don't add the from_tw label when you first create a PR, it will not automatically assign a reviewer. If you forget to add the label before opening the PR: Add the from_tw label. Turn the PR into a draft PR. Select the PR is ready for review button at the bottom of the page to reopen the PR. The PR should now have a reviewer. Preview a doc There are two main ways to preview branches you’ve already published and run commits on: Local: Quicker, but requires a semi-substantial amount of setup and familiarity with a terminal. Gatsby Cloud: Full preview of the live site with no overhead, and a very convenient way to share a preview of your draft with a SME. Gatsby Cloud will comment on your PR with a link to a preview version of the site once the build is ready. Building the site generally takes about 15 minutes, but can sometimes take longer if there are a lot of changes. Revise and publish a doc If you’re notified that a reviewer has submitted a review to your file, go to your PR and review the changes. You might see them in the diff view, if they’re part of a review with comments; otherwise, they might appear as copy edits in the file. Respond to any comments in the file. Either reply with follow up discussion, or click Resolve conversation. When you’ve resolved all the comments, and all of the automatic checks have passed, you can merge the pull request. Merging the pull request sets in motion the automated build process and your changes will be published shortly. Note: You will only be able to merge when the Merge pull request button is green. If it’s not green, review for any comments you missed, or other messages that indicate why GitHub is blocking you from merging. Revert merging Remember that you can almost always undo things. If you merge a PR, and then find that you shouldn’t have, you can unmerge with the Revert button. On the Pull requests tab in GitHub, click Closed on the tally bar to see all the issues and PRs that have alredy been merged. Locate the PR you merged, and locate the Revert button. Click Revert. That creates a new PR, which needs to be merged. If you want to reopen it, you need to follow the link back to the original PR and either revert that or reopen it. Writers only: Work on a branch, not a fork Some teams work on branches, some teams work on forks; the Docs team works in branches. As long as a branch has been pushed upstream, this allows us to work collaboratively and ensure that no work is ever lost when someone goes on vacation. To create a branch on the docs-website repo: Open GitHub Desktop Click on Current branch: xxx Click on New Branch You will be prompted to name your new branch. Descriptive names are best. It's a great way to quickly clue people in to what your work is all about. For example, if you are working on What’s New pages, you might name the branch Whats-new-updates. When you create a new branch, don't forget to add the Jira issue's key (DOC-1234) to the branch name and the PR title.",

      "body": "We welcome your contributions, whether you are a New Relic employee or a New Relic user! And we don't want you to worry about style. When you edit a file, tech writers on our team review it for style, grammar, and formatting. That said, if you're curious about our style guidelines, you're welcome (but not obligated) to take a look. Edit a doc If you see a minor problem in our documentation that you want to quickly fix, you can use GitHub to edit the file and submit your pull request. A member of the Docs team will review your edit and publish your changes. We'll follow up with you if we have any questions. To edit existing content without building the site locally: On the docs site, navigate to the doc you'd like to edit. Click Edit page on the top corner of the right nav. A GitHub page will open with the source of the doc. Click the pencil icon in the top right. Make your edits (don't worry too much about formatting or grammar, we're happy to take care of that). At the bottom of the page, enter acommit message that describes your change, then click Commit changes. Follow the prompts to submit your pull request. A member of the Docs team will review your pull request and comment with any feedback. Once we've merged your pull request into the Develop branch, your changes will go live with our next deploy (usually within a few hours). Create new docs You can use article templates or clone an existing doc as a template. To create a new doc: Clone the repo on your computer. In /src/content/docs/, find a good location for your doc. Using your text editor, create a new .mdx file or copy an existing doc. Write your content. Optional: Add your doc to the right nav .yml file. The navigation files can be a bit hard to work with, so feel free to leave this step for a Docs writer to handle when they review your pull request. Commit your changes and create a pull request. The Tech Docs team has two heroes watching for new pull requests. We'll help you get the content finalized and make sure that it's in the right place. Clone (copy) an existing doc Once you've cloned the docs-website repository, use your text editor to copy an existing doc. Rename and edit the copy and then save it as a new doc. Your cloned doc automatically inherits the original doc's frontmatter content. Make sure to change that, too. If you want your cloned doc to be translated, follow standard procedures to request translation. For bigger projects If you're making larger changes like adding a whole new doc or editing many existing docs, it can be helpful to run the site locally. For instructions, see Tech writer workflow. Delete pages If you are comfortable with deleting the page yourself, go for it. If not, ask us by: File an issue in the docs-website repo, or contact the @hero in the #documentation channel if you're a New Relic employee. We'll take a look at your issue and help out. Private edits If you need to stage content for a private beta or limited release, contact the docs hero in the #documentation Slack channel. Request a future publication date (for New Relic employees) If your draft needs to be released on a specific date or within a specific timeframe (for example, right before a release), contact the Tech Docs @hero in the #documentation Slack channel. If you're not a New Relic employee, please create a GitHub issue.",

      "body": "Download latest version The Diagnostics CLI (nrdiag) is a utility that automatically detects common problems with New Relic products. If the Diagnostics CLI detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. The Diagnostics CLI can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket. The Diagnostics CLI is open source and is located in GitHub. For additional troubleshooting steps for your agent, check out Not seeing data. Here's an example of the Diagnostics CLI running on Ubuntu Linux. The program checks your New Relic agent configurations for issues and generates zipped troubleshooting logs that are ready to be attached to support tickets. Compatibility The Diagnostics CLI is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows. It can detect common configuration issues for: APM: Available for all APM agents except C SDK. For the Go agent, only basic connectivity checks are available. Browser monitoring: Browser agent detection Infrastructure monitoring: Linux and Windows agents Mobile agents: iOS and Android Synthetic monitoring: Containerized private minions (CPM) The Diagnostics CLI does not require superuser or admin permissions to run, although we recommend those permissions for some checks. It will return an error if it does not have permissions to read the files it scans. Get started To use the Diagnostics CLI: Run the Diagnostics CLI, including task suites and command line options as needed. Include an attachment key when you upload the results to your Support ticket. Optional: Validate your config file settings. Interpret the output. Like any other New Relic tool, the Diagnostics CLI service is designed to protect you and your customers' data privacy.

      "body": "This document will guide you through the entire workflow for editing the New Relic documentation site as a New Relic Tech Docs Writer. Resources VSCode (or another text editor) VSCode has great GitHub integrations GitHub account GitHub Desktop Edit in the GitHub web editor vs local build Need to edit a doc? Use this table to decide where to work! Use the GitHub web editor for: Use the local build for: Adding content to one doc: Rewriting sentences, or 1-2 lines Editing small amounts of content: updating URLs, deleting typos, etc. Brand new docs Rewrites of more than 1 or 2 lines Any updates to doc frontmatter Title changes Taxonomy changes Metadescription updates Redirects Updating images Editing multiple docs at once Continue reading for instructions on how to edit a doc locally. 1. Set up your local environment Running the site locally makes testing and previewing large changes much easier. Here's how to get setup: Install GitHub Desktop Sign in to GitHub Desktop. On Macs, click on GitHub Desktop in the top left corner of your screen and select Preferences. Select the blue Sign In button and follow the prompts in the browser window. Navigate to the Docs Site repository on GitHub.com. Click the green Code button and then select Open with GitHub Desktop. Choose the location where you want the repo, and this will clone the entire repository to your local machine at the designated path. You can ensure the repo was cloned by navigating to your local GitHub folder (the default is ~/Documents/github). Once you have cloned the repo, you don't need to clone it again in the future. 2. Run the site locally Build the site locally using the terminal to preview changes before opening a Pull Request. While it's highly recommended to build the site locally, this is technically an optional step. The site will automatically reflect any local changes once build. Node and Yarn are tools used to build the site on your local machine. Prerequisites Install Node Install Yarn npm install -g yarn Build the site In your terminal, go to your cloned repo, docs-website. For example: cd ~/Documents/github/docs-website Run yarn with the following commands: yarn && yarn start The site will take a few minutes to build. Make yourself some tea or coffee. Once it's built, you can access your preview site in your browser by navigating to http://localhost:8000/ 3. Edit a doc Once your local environment and branch are set up, you're ready to edit a doc. Check out the style guide for writing guidelines. First, ensure your Current Branch in GitHub Desktop is set to the correct branch, not Develop. Navigate to the doc you want to edit in Finder. If I wanted to edit a Python agent doc, I would navigate to: ~/Documents/github/docs-website/src/content/docs/agents/python-agent/hosting-services/python-agent-stackato.mdx Edit the doc in your text editor of choice. You should write docs in markdown language. Reference the style guide for help with formatting markdown Save the file with your edits, then follow the same process for any other docs you wish to edit. 4. Commit your changes Once your edits are done, you can commit them. This stages your changes, which you will later push upstream to Github. By pushing your changes, everyone will have access to your branch and commits. Navigate to GitHub Desktop. The left column should have a record of all the edits you have made to docs. In the bottom left corner, name your commit and add a good description of your edits. It should be descriptive enough to ensure that someone can understand all the changes made by simply scanning this description. Click Commit to [yourbranchname] 5. Publish your commits Once you have committed your changes, you're almost ready to open your Pull Request. First, you need to ensure your branch is pushed upstream. On GitHub desktop, click the blue Publish Branch button if available. If you don't see the Publish Branch, click the blue Push Origin button. This will push all your commits upstream and make them available to everyone else through the GitHub repository. 6. Open your pull request Now that your commits are available to everyone, you need to notify people that your changes are ready to be merged into the develop branch. To do this, you open a pull request: On GitHub Desktop, click the blue Create Pull Request button. This will open GitHub in your browser, and prompt you to fill in your pull request. Ensure you're merging from your branch into either the main or develop branch. If you scroll down, you can review all your commits to ensure they reflect all your changes. Just like your commit description, your pull request description should be detailed and give the full context of your changes. Feel free to add any additional context here (issue or Jira number, SMEs, etc.) To request a review from another Tech Writer: in GitHub open the PR, navigate to the Conversation section, and then select or type in a reviewer name in the Reviewer section. Add any relevant labels to your PR. If you do not add from_tw, the PR will not be automatically assigned to another writer for review. Once you're satisfied with your pull request, click the green Create pull request button. You can either publish the changes directly by approving the pull request yourself, or you can request for another Tech Writer to peer edit it. At the bottom of the pull request page, you will see a Checks section. These checks ensure your PR doesn't break the build process of the site. Ensure all checks marked required pass before merging. Once the pull request has passed the checks and it has been approved by another tech writer (or you are confident the changes are ready to be published), click the green Merge pull request button. This will merge your branch and commits into the repository and will begin the build process. If you don't add the from_tw label when you first create a PR, it will not automatically assign a reviewer. If you forget to add the label before opening the PR: Add the from_tw label. Turn the PR into a draft PR. Select the PR is ready for review button at the bottom of the page to reopen the PR. The PR should now have a reviewer. Preview a doc There are two main ways to preview branches you’ve already published and run commits on: Local: Quicker, but requires a semi-substantial amount of setup and familiarity with a terminal. Gatsby Cloud: Full preview of the live site with no overhead, and a very convenient way to share a preview of your draft with a SME. Gatsby Cloud will comment on your PR with a link to a preview version of the site once the build is ready. Building the site generally takes about 15 minutes, but can sometimes take longer if there are a lot of changes. Revise and publish a doc If you’re notified that a reviewer has submitted a review to your file, go to your PR and review the changes. You might see them in the diff view, if they’re part of a review with comments; otherwise, they might appear as copy edits in the file. Respond to any comments in the file. Either reply with follow up discussion, or click Resolve conversation. When you’ve resolved all the comments, and all of the automatic checks have passed, you can merge the pull request. Merging the pull request sets in motion the automated build process and your changes will be published shortly. Note: You will only be able to merge when the Merge pull request button is green. If it’s not green, review for any comments you missed, or other messages that indicate why GitHub is blocking you from merging. Revert merging Remember that you can almost always undo things. If you merge a PR, and then find that you shouldn’t have, you can unmerge with the Revert button. On the Pull requests tab in GitHub, click Closed on the tally bar to see all the issues and PRs that have alredy been merged. Locate the PR you merged, and locate the Revert button. Click Revert. That creates a new PR, which needs to be merged. If you want to reopen it, you need to follow the link back to the original PR and either revert that or reopen it. Writers only: Work on a branch, not a fork Some teams work on branches, some teams work on forks; the Docs team works in branches. As long as a branch has been pushed upstream, this allows us to work collaboratively and ensure that no work is ever lost when someone goes on vacation. To create a branch on the docs-website repo: Open GitHub Desktop Click on Current branch: xxx Click on New Branch You will be prompted to name your new branch. Descriptive names are best. It's a great way to quickly clue people in to what your work is all about. For example, if you are working on What’s New pages, you might name the branch Whats-new-updates. When you create a new branch, don't forget to add the Jira issue's key (DOC-1234) to the branch name and the PR title.",

      "body": "We welcome your contributions, whether you are a New Relic employee or a New Relic user! And we don't want you to worry about style. When you edit a file, tech writers on our team review it for style, grammar, and formatting. That said, if you're curious about our style guidelines, you're welcome (but not obligated) to take a look. Edit a doc If you see a minor problem in our documentation that you want to quickly fix, you can use GitHub to edit the file and submit your pull request. A member of the Docs team will review your edit and publish your changes. We'll follow up with you if we have any questions. To edit existing content without building the site locally: On the docs site, navigate to the doc you'd like to edit. Click Edit page on the top corner of the right nav. A GitHub page will open with the source of the doc. Click the pencil icon in the top right. Make your edits (don't worry too much about formatting or grammar, we're happy to take care of that). At the bottom of the page, enter acommit message that describes your change, then click Commit changes. Follow the prompts to submit your pull request. A member of the Docs team will review your pull request and comment with any feedback. Once we've merged your pull request into the Develop branch, your changes will go live with our next deploy (usually within a few hours). Create new docs You can use article templates or clone an existing doc as a template. To create a new doc: Clone the repo on your computer. In /src/content/docs/, find a good location for your doc. Using your text editor, create a new .mdx file or copy an existing doc. Write your content. Optional: Add your doc to the right nav .yml file. The navigation files can be a bit hard to work with, so feel free to leave this step for a Docs writer to handle when they review your pull request. Commit your changes and create a pull request. The Tech Docs team has two heroes watching for new pull requests. We'll help you get the content finalized and make sure that it's in the right place. Clone (copy) an existing doc Once you've cloned the docs-website repository, use your text editor to copy an existing doc. Rename and edit the copy and then save it as a new doc. Your cloned doc automatically inherits the original doc's frontmatter content. Make sure to change that, too. If you want your cloned doc to be translated, follow standard procedures to request translation. For bigger projects If you're making larger changes like adding a whole new doc or editing many existing docs, it can be helpful to run the site locally. For instructions, see Tech writer workflow. Delete pages If you are comfortable with deleting the page yourself, go for it. If not, ask us by: File an issue in the docs-website repo, or contact the @hero in the #documentation channel if you're a New Relic employee. We'll take a look at your issue and help out. Private edits If you need to stage content for a private beta or limited release, contact the docs hero in the #documentation Slack channel. Request a future publication date (for New Relic employees) If your draft needs to be released on a specific date or within a specific timeframe (for example, right before a release), contact the Tech Docs @hero in the #documentation Slack channel. If you're not a New Relic employee, please create a GitHub issue.",

Either reply with follow up discussion, or click Resolve conversation. When you’ve resolved all the comments, and all of the automatic checks have passed, you can merge the pull request. Merging the pull request sets in motion the automated build process and your changes will be published shortly. Note: You will only be able to merge when the Merge pull request button is green. If it’s not green, review for any comments you missed, or other messages that indicate why GitHub is blocking you from merging. Revert merging Remember that you can almost always undo things. If you merge a PR, and then find that you shouldn’t have, you can unmerge with the Revert button. On the Pull requests tab in GitHub, click Closed on the tally bar to see all the issues and PRs that have alredy been merged. Locate the PR you merged, and locate the Revert button. Click Revert. That creates a new PR, which needs to be merged. If you want to reopen it, you need to follow the link back to the original PR and either revert that or reopen it. Writers only: Work on a branch, not a fork Some teams work on branches, some teams work on forks; the Docs team works in branches. As long as a branch has been pushed upstream, this allows us to work collaboratively and ensure that no work is ever lost when someone goes on vacation. To create a branch on the docs-website repo: Open GitHub Desktop Click on Current branch: xxx Click on New Branch You will be prompted to name your new branch. Descriptive names are best. It's a great way to quickly clue people in to what your work is all about. For example, if you are working on What’s New pages, you might name the branch Whats-new-updates. When you create a new branch, don't forget to add the Jira issue's key (DOC-1234) to the branch name and the PR title.",

To troubleshoot GitHub issues, see our guide. Peer editing workflow in GitHub If you’re peer editing a doc or have been otherwise assigned to a PR as a reviewer, you have a few choices for how and where to do the work. The most streamlined and open-source approach is to do the edit using GitHub options, rather than copying the file to Google Docs and editing there. Developmental edit pass For cases where you have questions and suggestions rather than straight copy edits, follow these steps. Open the PR that you’re assigned to review. On the Files changed tab, you can either: Click Review changes and then select one of the following: Comment - use if you have a comment that doesn’t require follow up. Approve - use if you just want to approve the PR. You can request changes in the Leave a comment area, and select Approve if you want to let the writer make the edits and merge the file without a follow-up review from you. Request changes - use for times when you want to make sure the changes you request are included. You’ll be notified with any updates that the writer makes. OR, start making comments on lines or sections of the doc. To do this, click the add comment icon , and leave an edit or comment for that specific line in the page. With this option, you get the choice between adding a single comment or starting a review. If you’re going to make comments throughout a doc, choose Start a review so the comments will all be rolled into one commit. Click Finish your review to complete your review. This triggers a notification to the writer alerting them that you’ve made suggestions. Copy edit workflow If you have copy edits for a file rather than comments and suggestions, you can make the changes to the file in different ways. Here are two main options: Edit using the GitHub browser: On the Files changed tab, in the diff window click the editing button (three dots). When you finish your edits, add a comment at the bottom of the file and choose to either commit the changes directly, or create a branch and start a pull request. Choose to branch and start a pull request if you expect a writer to review the diff and accept or revise your edits. Edit locally: Check out the branch containing the file you want to edit. In GitHub Desktop, click the Current branch down arrow and select the branch. Then, make the edits on your local drive, save, and commit your changes to the branch. Note that this approach adds your edits to the open pull request. You can now see the changes you added to the file on the Files changed tab in the PR. These are just a few of many editing options. You’ll find your preferred way, just as with any other tool.",

Read on for more information about this metadata content: Meta content field Description Title Whenever possible, provide an action-oriented or task-oriented title; for example, \"AJAX page: Identify time-consuming calls.\" In general, use sentence case. Capitalize only the first word. Do not capitalize any other word in the title unless it's a proper noun, such as a specific product name, or it follows a colon (:).

If omitted, the default type is page and the basicDoc template is used. template The template determines the basic layout and style of a page. Use basicDoc for more pages. tags Keywords related to your doc. Start each topic with a _* on a new line. A topic can include multiple words separated by spaces. japaneseVersion The URL to the Japanese language version of the doc. Leave this blank if there isn't a Japanese version.

For more information, see apiStyleGuidelines (for style guidelines) and Work with the API doc content type (for how to use and configure). Attribute definition This format is for defining attributes and event types. These definitions are shared with the UI via the data dictionary service. For more information, see Work with attribute definition content type. Landing pages This format is for a more user-friendly and readable landing page, which replaces the standard taxonomy list views. For more information, see Working with landing pages. Release notes This format includes specific fields for release notes. Users rely on release notes to keep up with smaller changes in the product, particularly for downloadble software like the agents. For more information, see Create release notes. What's New posts This format includes specific fields for product announcements. What's New posts are created by PMM for larger announcements. They're available in the docs site, but they're also visible in the New Relic One UI. For more information, see What's New style guidelines.

For inline code or data (<code>) To surround small blocks of code or data (single words or lines), mark as code: Source: Use <code> tags. Markdown: Surround the text with backtick ` characters. For multi-line code blocks (<pre>) To surround longer blocks of data that run multiple lines, mark as preformatted text: Source: Use <pre> tags. Markdown: Do not use Markdown-style indented code formatting, as this can cause unexpected formatting problems. Highlight user input with <var> Use the <var> tag to highlight areas of a code block where a user is expected to supply their own value. For more context on when to use <var> tags, see < var> formatting guidelines. Follow these guidelines when you use <var> tags: Address the reader directly Use all caps and underscores _ to separate words (also known as SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE). Don't use other punctuation (such as wrapping the text in angle brackets). Exception: REST API examples use a ${VARNAME} syntax inspired by Bash conventions. Standard examples: echo \"license_key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" | sudo tee -a /etc/newrelic-infra.yml Copy msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\newrelic-infra.msi Copy https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/applications/APP_ID Copy REST API v2 example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.xml\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=HttpDispatcher&values[]=average_call_time&values[]=call_count&from=2014-03-01T20:59:00+00:00&to=2014-03-01T21:59:00+00:00&summarize=true' Copy Highlight important sections with <mark> Use the <mark> tag to highlight areas of a code block that are particularly important. Most commonly, <mark> is used to highlight New Relic API methods in sample code that contains a lot of \"other logic.\" When you use <mark>, you should usually follow the code block with a list of bullets that explain what each API call is doing and link to method syntax. For more context on when to use <mark> tags, see < mark> formatting guidelines. Examples: Example of using the <mark> tag private void storeItem(long id) { Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). startSegment(\"storeItem\") ; segment. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters .product(\"H2\") .collection(null) .operation(\"insert\") .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) .databaseName(\"test\") .build()) ; // fire and forget DB_POOL.submit(() -> { segment.end() ; insertData(id); }); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: startSegment(...): Begins the segment that will time the code. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters()): Associates the time with a datastore external call This will show up in APM with datastore data. For more information, see reportAsExternal API. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. segment.end(): Stops timing this segment. For method syntax, see the Javadoc. Add syntax highlighting To add syntax highlighting to a code block, add class=\"highlight\" to the <pre> tag. The syntax highlighter tries to auto-detect the language. If it's not working as expected, ensure the language is supported and specify the language by adding the a lang-LANG-NAME class (for example: lang-html). View a full list of supported languages for syntax highlighting. Element colors and themes are fully customizable. Link to other docs You can add <a href> tags inside a <pre> blocks, just as you would any other content. However, make sure to use them judiciously since they can be easy to miss. A good example is the Infrastructure config file template, where each config element links to the relevant section of the main config doc.",

      "body": "Logs in context for the .NET agent connects your logs and APM data in New Relic. Bringing all of this data together in a single tool helps you quickly get to the root cause of an issue and find the log lines that you need to identify and resolve a problem. Set up your .NET app To enable logs in context for APM apps monitored by .NET: Make sure you have already set up logging in New Relic. This includes configuring a supported log forwarder that collects your application logs and extends the metadata that is forwarded to New Relic. Install or update to the latest .NET agent version, and enable distributed tracing. Use .NET agent version 8.21 or higher and the New Relic .NET agent API version 8.21 or higher for logs in context. Install or update to Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 or higher or .NET Core 2.0 or higher. Install and configure any of the following logging extensions to enrich your log data, including: log4net NLog Serilog Check your log data in the New Relic UI. Configure log4net extension You can use the Apache log4net version 2.0.8 or higher extension to link your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. log4net workflow diagram The following diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through Apache log4net, highlighting specific components of the New Relic log4net extension. Many log forwarders are available. This example uses Fluentd. Appender: The NewRelicAppender adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application. This contextual information, known as linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans from which they were created. This appender will pass the enriched log events to downstream appenders for further processing. Since the NewRelicAppender is ForwardingAppender type, it needs to be the first appender in the chain. It also requires another appender that can write to an actual output destination as its child in order to work. Layout: The NewRelicLayout formats the enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. The appender, which this layout is assigned to, instructs log4net to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. Log Forwarder: The log forwarder monitors an output folder and incrementally sends the properly formatted and enriched log information to the New Relic logging endpoint. log4net 2.0.8 or higher configuration Log4net uses appender and layout to store and format log messages. NewRelicAppender enriches log messages with contextual information from the New Relic .NET agent if it is attached to your application. The appender passes enriched log messages to downstream appenders to handle specific use cases for log messages. For more information about logging with log4net, see the Apache log4net Getting started documentation. To configure logs in context with the log4net extension: Using the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager, locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net package. In your log4net configuration file, update your logging configuration to use the NewRelicAppender as the first level appender, and reference your existing appenders as its children. Also replace the layout of the appender that writes log messages to an output destination with the NewRelicLayout. The following log4net configuration example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: <log4net> <root> <level value=\"ALL\" /> <appender-ref ref=\"NewRelicAppender\" /> </root> <appender name=\"NewRelicAppender\" type=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net.NewRelicAppender, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net\" > <threshold value=\"ALL\"/> <appender-ref ref=\"FileAppender\" /> </appender> <appender name=\"FileAppender\" type=\"log4net.Appender.FileAppender\"> <file value=\"C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json\" /> <param name=\"AppendToFile\" value=\"true\" /> <layout type=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net.NewRelicLayout, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Log4Net\"> </layout> </appender> </log4net> Copy After you configure the log4net extension and update your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. Here is an example configuration using the Fluentd plugin for New Relic Logs: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\log4netExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy Configure NLog extension You can use our NLog 4.5 or higher extension to link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. Nlog workflow diagram The New Relic NLog extension provides a NewRelicJsonLayout that formats a log event in the way required by the New Relic logging endpoint. Next, it adds contextual information from the .NET agent when attached to your application. Then, a target can be configured to write logging data to an output folder. The log forwarder can monitor this folder and incrementally send log information to New Relic. The following diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through NLog, highlighting specific components of the New Relic NLog extension. New Relic JSON Layout: The NewRelicJsonLayout adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application, and outputs log messages in the JSON format expected by New Relic. This contextual information, known as linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans where they were created. Since the NewRelicAppender is ForwardingAppender type, it needs to be the first appender in the chain. It also requires another appender that can write to an actual output destination as its child in order to work. File Target: A FileTarget defines a file on disk where log messages are written. Adding the NewRelicJsonLayout to that target allows the output to be formatted correctly for forwarding to New Relic. Log Forwarder: The log forwarder is configured to send the properly formatted and enriched log data from the FileTarget output to the New Relic logging endpoint. For more information about logging with NLog, see the nlog-project.org documentation. Nlog 4.5 or higher configuration Use our NLog 4.5 or higher extension to link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. Using the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager, locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.NLog package. In your application code, update your logging configuration to add the NewRelicJsonLayout and decide if you want to collect MappedDiagnosticsContext (MDC) or the MappedDiagnosticsLogicalContext (MDLC) data. The following configuration examples result in new JSON files that are written to disk. Some of these configuration options may be useful for managing the amount of disk space used and/or the performance of the target. archiveAboveSize maxArchiveFiles bufferSize enableArchiveFileCompression autoFlush concurrentWrites Although the NLog AsyncWrapper Target is not required, it may help improve performance by performing formatting and output of log files on a different thread. Don't collect MDC or the MDLC data (default): The following code example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata, but not with MDC or the MDLC data. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggingConfiguration(); var newRelicFileTarget = new FileTarget(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); newRelicFileTarget.Layout = new NewRelicJsonLayout(); newRelicFileTarget.FileName = \"C:\\logs\\NLogExample.json\"; loggerConfig.AddTarget(newRelicFileTarget); loggerConfig.AddRuleForAllLevels(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); LogManager.Configuration = loggerConfig; var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"Example\"); Copy Collect MDC or the MDLC data: If your application uses the MDC or the MDLC, you can configure the NewRelicJsonLayout to include items in those collections. The following code example adds the additional configuration to enable collecting MDC and MDLC data. As in the previous example, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggingConfiguration(); var newRelicFileTarget = new FileTarget(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); var newRelicLayout = new NewRelicJsonLayout { IncludeMdc = `true,` IncludeMdlc = `true` }; newRelicFileTarget.Layout = newRelicLayout; newRelicFileTarget.FileName = \"C:\\logs\\NLogExample.json\"; loggerConfig.AddTarget(newRelicFileTarget); loggerConfig.AddRuleForAllLevels(\"NewRelicFileTarget\"); LogManager.Configuration = loggerConfig; var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"Example\"); Copy Once you have configured the NLog extension and updated your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. Here is an example configuration using the Fluentd plugin to forward logs to New Relic: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\NLogExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy Nlog file-based configuration You can also configure the New Relic NLog extension with file-based configuration providers. The folowing example code creates a logger based on settings contained in an App.config file. Instantiating Logger using .config file var logger = LogManager.GetLogger(\"NewRelicLog\"); logger.Info(\"Hello, New Relic!\"); Copy Sample App.config file <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?> <configuration> <configSections> <section name=\"nlog\" type=\"NLog.Config.ConfigSectionHandler, NLog\"/> </configSections> <startup> <supportedRuntime version=\"v4.0\" sku=\".NETFramework,Version=v4.5\" /> </startup> <nlog xmlns=\"http://www.nlog-project.org/schemas/NLog.xsd\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"> <extensions> <add assembly=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.NLog\" /> </extensions> <targets> <target name=\"NewRelicLogFile\" xsi:type=\"File\" fileName=\"C:/path/to/NewRelicLog.json\"> <layout xsi:type=\"newrelic-jsonlayout\"> </layout> </target> </targets> <rules> <logger name=\"NewRelicLog\" minlevel=\"Info\" writeTo=\"newRelicLogFile\" /> </rules> </nlog> </configuration> Copy Configure Serilog 2.5 or higher extension You can use our Serilog extension to link to your log data with related data across the rest of the New Relic platform. This requires: Serilog 2.5 or higher Serilog File Sinks v4.0 or higher Serilog workflow diagram Serilog is a structured logging framework that records log messages from your application and creates a LogEvent to store the message data. Using Enrichers, you can add additional information to the log events. Sinks and Formatters allow you to format and output those log events for downstream consumption and viewing. The following diagram illustrates the flow of log messages through Serilog, highlighting specific components of the New Relic Serilog extension. Many log forwarders are available. This example uses Fluentd. New Relic Enricher: The NewRelicEnricher adds contextual information from the .NET agent (using the API) to the log events generated by the application. This contextual information, called linking metadata, is used by New Relic to link log messages to the transactions and spans where they were created. New Relic Formatter: The NewRelicFormatter translates enriched log events into the JSON format expected by New Relic. A sink instructs Serilog to output the JSON to a file in the location that the log forwarder expects. New Relic Log Forwarder: The log forwarder is configured to send the properly formatted and enriched log data from the FileTarget output to the New Relic logging endpoint. For more information about Serilog log events, see the Serilog documentation on GitHub. Serilog 2.5 or higher configuration To configure logs in context with the Serilog extension: Use the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager to locate and install the NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog package. In your application code, update your logging configuration to add the NewRelicEnricher and NewRelicFormatter. The following code example enriches log events with New Relic linking metadata. In addition to the existing log files, it outputs new log files in a specific JSON format at C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json for consumption by the log forwarder: var loggerConfig = new LoggerConfiguration() loggerConfig .Enrich.WithThreadName() .Enrich.WithThreadId() .Enrich.WithNewRelicLogsInContext() .WriteTo.File( path: @\"C:\\logs\\ExistingLoggingOutput.txt\") .WriteTo.File( formatter: new NewRelicFormatter(), path: @\"C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json\"); var log = loggerConfig.CreateLogger(); Copy This configuration results in new JSON files that are written to disk. Some of these configuration options may be useful for managing the amount of disk space used and/or the performance of the sink. restrictedToMinimumLevel buffered rollingInterval rollOnFileSizeLimit retainedFileCountLimit Although not required, using the Serilog Asynchronous Sink Wrapper may help improve the performance by performing formatting and output of log files on a different thread. Once you have configured the Serilog extension and updated your logging file, you can configure your extension to send data to New Relic. Here is an example configuration using the Fluentd plugin to forward logs to New Relic: <!--NewRelicLoggingExample.conf--> <source> @type tail path C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json pos_file C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json.pos tag logfile.* <parse> @type json </parse> </source> <match **> @type newrelic license_key <YOUR NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY> base_uri https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1 </match> Copy Serilog file-based configuration You can also configure the New Relic Serilog extension with file-based configuration providers.The following additional NuGet Packages are required: Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration/) Serilog.Settings.Configuration The following example code creates a logger based on settings contained in an appSettings.json file. Instantiating logger using appsettings.json var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder() .AddJsonFile(\"appsettings.json\"); var configuration = builder.Build(); var logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .ReadFrom.Configuration(configuration) .CreateLogger(); Copy Sample appsettings.json file { \"Serilog\": { \"Using\": [ \"Serilog.Sinks.Console\", \"Serilog.Sinks.File\", \"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" ], \"MinimumLevel\": \"Debug\", \"Enrich\": [ \"WithNewRelicLogsInContext\" ], \"WriteTo\": [ { \"Name\": \"File\", \"Args\": { \"path\": \"C:\\\\Logs\\\\SerilogExample.log.json\", \"formatter\": \"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog.NewRelicFormatter, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" } } ], \"Properties\": { \"Application\": \"NewRelic Logging Serilog Example\" } } } Copy The following example code creates a logger based on settings contained in a web.config file. The Serilog.Settings.AppSettings NuGet Package is required. Instantiating logger using .config file var logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .ReadFrom.AppSettings() .CreateLogger(); Copy Sample web.config file <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <configuration> <appSettings> <add key=\"serilog:using:NewRelic\" value=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" /> <add key=\"serilog:using:File\" value=\"Serilog.Sinks.File\" /> <!--Add other enrichers here--> <add key=\"serilog:enrich:WithNewRelicLogsInContext\" /> <add key=\"serilog:write-to:File.path\" value=\"C:\\logs\\SerilogExample.log.json\" /> <add key=\"serilog:write-to:File.formatter\" value=\"NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog.NewRelicFormatter, NewRelic.LogEnrichers.Serilog\" /> </appSettings> Copy View logs in the UI To verify that you have configured the log appender correctly, run your application, then check your logs data in New Relic One using the query operator has:span.id has:trace.id. If everything is configured correctly and your data is being forwarded to New Relic with the enriched metadata, your logs should now be emitted as JSON and contain trace.id and span.id fields. If you don't see log data in the UI, follow the troubleshooting procedures. What's next? After you set up APM logs in context, make the most of your logging data: Explore the logging data across your platform with our Logs UI. See your logs in context of your app's performance in the APM UI. Troubleshoot errors with distributed tracing, stack traces, application logs, and more. Get deeper visibility into both your application and your platform performance data by forwarding your logs with our infrastructure monitoring agent. Review your infrastructure logs in the UI. Set up alerts. Query your data and create dashboards.",

      "body": "We've written these guidelines to make it easier for you to contribute to our docs, as well as to give you some insight into how we think about good technical writing. We, the Tech Docs team, rely on your expertise to keep New Relic's documentation updated and useful. Thank you for your willingness to share your knowledge! Our style guide focuses on style and usage that's particular to our site. Our site follows American English conventions. For topics that aren't covered, please refer to the Microsoft Writing Style Guide (for guidelines on technical terminology) or the Chicago Manual of Style (for general writing and editing guidelines). Organize your doc to make it easier to read Consider these organization guidelines when thinking about the order of information in a doc. By following these guidelines, you'll make it easier for readers to skim and find what they need. How to organize information Comments Separate what and why from how. Define any necessary prerequisites, policies, or background information (the what and the why) before you step through the how (step-by-step procedures). Examples: Explain what the feature is and why it matters before telling readers how to use it. Describe any limitations with user permissions or subscription levels that would prevent them from using the feature. If the feature is available for any user or subscription level, don't bother to say so. Provide a roadmap for what users will be able to accomplish, so they know before starting a procedure that they have everything they need. Front-load directions with context. Make sure readers know where they need to be, before telling them what to do. In general, use (select an app) to describe what users select from the product index. Examples: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app or service). Select (account dropdown) > User preferences. On the command line, type gitk. Also, structure steps by front-loading context from the user's point of view. For example, instead of \"Go to x to do y,\" structure the step as \"To do y, go to x.\" Separate requirements from options. Example: Type the Email you use to sign in and to receive information from New Relic. Optional: Type additional user emails, separated by commas. Follow the \"five to nine\" guideline. Depending on the topic, organize the information so there is a maximum of five to nine chunks of information. For example, readers may start to get lost or overwhelmed after about five h2 sections or seven steps into a procedure. If you have more than nine h2 sections or steps, you might need to create an additional doc or procedure. Other organization tools to consider: Levels of headings Lists Collapsers Callouts Tables Code examples For more help section Use action-oriented titles Wherever possible, give your document or h2 heading a task- or action-oriented title. Focus on what users are trying to accomplish or the problem they're trying to solve. Use present-tense verbs, rather than \"-ing\" verbs. Quality Title example Bad The query history Okay View query history Good Query history: Create and edit NRQL queries Start the document with an introductory paragraph Unless the document is less than a single screen in length, begin with a brief paragraph that introduces the topic or summarizes the important points. Not sure where to start? Try writing all the content for your document first, and then add the introduction to the top to summarize your key points. Or use the introduction to expand on the text in your metaDescription in the metadata. Keep documents short The amount of content needed can help you decide whether you need one or more documents for the topic. If all of the document's contents apply directly to the title, then everything belongs in the same document. If several related sections could be logically split into individual documents, and the overall length of your document is more than about two screenfuls, split those sections into other documents. Be sure to include links to the related contents. If a large document needs to be broken into multiple smaller documents, consider whether they might be best grouped together in their own sub-category. Use the New Relic voice We strive for a voice that's approachable, expert, and visionary. Check out our voice guidelines for how to write content with these qualities. And keep in mind these essential writing tips that apply to any type of documentation. Guidelines Comments Be clear and direct. Remember to: Use present tense. Use active voice; avoid passive voice. Tell users what to do, not what they \"should\" do. If absolutely necessary, tell users what not to do in situations where unexpected results may occur. Whenever possible, provide an alternative suggestion when telling users what not to do. Example: Using active voice with an alternative suggestion for what not to do Do not use your config file to change this setting, because this could affect other processes. Instead, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app or service) > Settings > Application. Write to aid localization and translation. Do not use euphemisms, idioms, jargon, or slang. Use the same terms and wording consistently. If you need to include an abbreviation or acronym, spell it out the first time it appears in the document. Always take a moment to ask yourself whether people will really understand the terms you are using in the way you're using them. Change doc titles and anchors Because changes to doc titles, anchors, and redirects can break links to other docs, please create an issue to request these types of changes and we'll help you out with that. Create and edit categories Because changes to categories can affect large groups of docs at once, please create an issue to request these types of changes and we'll help you out with that.

      "body": "This document will guide you through the entire workflow for editing the New Relic documentation site as a New Relic Tech Docs Writer. Resources VSCode (or another text editor) VSCode has great GitHub integrations GitHub account GitHub Desktop Edit in the GitHub web editor vs local build Need to edit a doc? Use this table to decide where to work! Use the GitHub web editor for: Use the local build for: Adding content to one doc: Rewriting sentences, or 1-2 lines Editing small amounts of content: updating URLs, deleting typos, etc. Brand new docs Rewrites of more than 1 or 2 lines Any updates to doc frontmatter Title changes Taxonomy changes Metadescription updates Redirects Updating images Editing multiple docs at once Continue reading for instructions on how to edit a doc locally. 1. Set up your local environment Running the site locally makes testing and previewing large changes much easier. Here's how to get setup: Install GitHub Desktop Sign in to GitHub Desktop. On Macs, click on GitHub Desktop in the top left corner of your screen and select Preferences. Select the blue Sign In button and follow the prompts in the browser window. Navigate to the Docs Site repository on GitHub.com. Click the green Code button and then select Open with GitHub Desktop. Choose the location where you want the repo, and this will clone the entire repository to your local machine at the designated path. You can ensure the repo was cloned by navigating to your local GitHub folder (the default is ~/Documents/github). Once you have cloned the repo, you don't need to clone it again in the future. 2. Run the site locally Build the site locally using the terminal to preview changes before opening a Pull Request. While it's highly recommended to build the site locally, this is technically an optional step. The site will automatically reflect any local changes once build. Node and Yarn are tools used to build the site on your local machine. Prerequisites Install Node Install Yarn npm install -g yarn Build the site In your terminal, go to your cloned repo, docs-website. For example: cd ~/Documents/github/docs-website Run yarn with the following commands: yarn && yarn start The site will take a few minutes to build. Make yourself some tea or coffee. Once it's built, you can access your preview site in your browser by navigating to http://localhost:8000/ 3. Edit a doc Once your local environment and branch are set up, you're ready to edit a doc. Check out the style guide for writing guidelines. First, ensure your Current Branch in GitHub Desktop is set to the correct branch, not Develop. Navigate to the doc you want to edit in Finder. If I wanted to edit a Python agent doc, I would navigate to: ~/Documents/github/docs-website/src/content/docs/agents/python-agent/hosting-services/python-agent-stackato.mdx Edit the doc in your text editor of choice. You should write docs in markdown language. Reference the style guide for help with formatting markdown Save the file with your edits, then follow the same process for any other docs you wish to edit. 4. Commit your changes Once your edits are done, you can commit them. This stages your changes, which you will later push upstream to Github. By pushing your changes, everyone will have access to your branch and commits. Navigate to GitHub Desktop. The left column should have a record of all the edits you have made to docs. In the bottom left corner, name your commit and add a good description of your edits. It should be descriptive enough to ensure that someone can understand all the changes made by simply scanning this description. Click Commit to [yourbranchname] 5. Publish your commits Once you have committed your changes, you're almost ready to open your Pull Request. First, you need to ensure your branch is pushed upstream. On GitHub desktop, click the blue Publish Branch button if available. If you don't see the Publish Branch, click the blue Push Origin button. This will push all your commits upstream and make them available to everyone else through the GitHub repository. 6. Open your pull request Now that your commits are available to everyone, you need to notify people that your changes are ready to be merged into the develop branch. To do this, you open a pull request: On GitHub Desktop, click the blue Create Pull Request button. This will open GitHub in your browser, and prompt you to fill in your pull request. Ensure you're merging from your branch into either the main or develop branch. If you scroll down, you can review all your commits to ensure they reflect all your changes. Just like your commit description, your pull request description should be detailed and give the full context of your changes. Feel free to add any additional context here (issue or Jira number, SMEs, etc.) To request a review from another Tech Writer: in GitHub open the PR, navigate to the Conversation section, and then select or type in a reviewer name in the Reviewer section. Add any relevant labels to your PR. If you do not add from_tw, the PR will not be automatically assigned to another writer for review. Once you're satisfied with your pull request, click the green Create pull request button. You can either publish the changes directly by approving the pull request yourself, or you can request for another Tech Writer to peer edit it. At the bottom of the pull request page, you will see a Checks section. These checks ensure your PR doesn't break the build process of the site. Ensure all checks marked required pass before merging. Once the pull request has passed the checks and it has been approved by another tech writer (or you are confident the changes are ready to be published), click the green Merge pull request button. This will merge your branch and commits into the repository and will begin the build process. If you don't add the from_tw label when you first create a PR, it will not automatically assign a reviewer. If you forget to add the label before opening the PR: Add the from_tw label. Turn the PR into a draft PR. Select the PR is ready for review button at the bottom of the page to reopen the PR. The PR should now have a reviewer. Preview a doc There are two main ways to preview branches you’ve already published and run commits on: Local: Quicker, but requires a semi-substantial amount of setup and familiarity with a terminal. Gatsby Cloud: Full preview of the live site with no overhead, and a very convenient way to share a preview of your draft with a SME. Gatsby Cloud will comment on your PR with a link to a preview version of the site once the build is ready. Building the site generally takes about 15 minutes, but can sometimes take longer if there are a lot of changes. Revise and publish a doc If you’re notified that a reviewer has submitted a review to your file, go to your PR and review the changes. You might see them in the diff view, if they’re part of a review with comments; otherwise, they might appear as copy edits in the file. Respond to any comments in the file. Either reply with follow up discussion, or click Resolve conversation. When you’ve resolved all the comments, and all of the automatic checks have passed, you can merge the pull request. Merging the pull request sets in motion the automated build process and your changes will be published shortly. Note: You will only be able to merge when the Merge pull request button is green. If it’s not green, review for any comments you missed, or other messages that indicate why GitHub is blocking you from merging. Revert merging Remember that you can almost always undo things. If you merge a PR, and then find that you shouldn’t have, you can unmerge with the Revert button. On the Pull requests tab in GitHub, click Closed on the tally bar to see all the issues and PRs that have alredy been merged. Locate the PR you merged, and locate the Revert button. Click Revert. That creates a new PR, which needs to be merged. If you want to reopen it, you need to follow the link back to the original PR and either revert that or reopen it. Writers only: Work on a branch, not a fork Some teams work on branches, some teams work on forks; the Docs team works in branches. As long as a branch has been pushed upstream, this allows us to work collaboratively and ensure that no work is ever lost when someone goes on vacation. To create a branch on the docs-website repo: Open GitHub Desktop Click on Current branch: xxx Click on New Branch You will be prompted to name your new branch. Descriptive names are best. It's a great way to quickly clue people in to what your work is all about. For example, if you are working on What’s New pages, you might name the branch Whats-new-updates. When you create a new branch, don't forget to add the Jira issue's key (DOC-1234) to the branch name and the PR title.",

      "body": "In December 2019, Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began supporting this new configuration format that makes use of a single configuration file (instead of two separate files), and provides other improvements. This document will explain how this newer format works. The older legacy configuration format is also supported by current Infrastructure agents. For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration structure An on-host integration's configuration YAML must have an integrations top-level section containing a YAML array, where each entry represents an integration and its configuration. For each integration entry, only the name property is mandatory. The other properties are optional. Here's an example configuration featuring two integrations: our built-in Docker integration, which requires no configuration, and our MySQL integration: integrations: # New Relic integration that does not require any configuration - name: nri-docker # New Relic integration that gets its configuration from the environment - name: nri-mysql env: PORT: 3306 USERNAME: newrelic PASSWORD: 123456789 # to hide this field, read the secrets management documentation # Any free-form integration executed via a user-provided command - name: my-own-integration exec: python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy You can have as many configuration YAML files as you want and can group your integration instances. Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Each configuration YAML file can also contain discovery and variables top-level sections. Important This configuration format does not require an agent restart. When saved, changes are detected and implemented immediately. This means that saving intermediate configuration changes may cause the integration to stop working. List of configuration properties This is a list of the general properties used to configure an integration. For more details about using these properties, including example values, see the documentation following the table. Config Description name Name of the integration. This is the only mandatory configuration property across all on-host integrations. If the exec field is not set it will also be the name of the integration executable. cli_args Optional list of command line arguments when name is used to provide the integration executable. Available since agent version 1.13.0. exec Full path to the integration executable, plus arguments. It may be a single-line string or a string array. If left unspecified, the exec field defaults to the name field. env YAML map containing the environment variables to be passed to the integration, where key is the environment variable name, and value is the variable value. config Configuration that is written as an external file and the path that is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. config_template_path Any external file whose path is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. Its usage allows applying discovery and secrets binding to any external configuration. integration_user Name of the user who runs the integration. interval Time between consecutive executions of the integration. It must be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h), without spaces. inventory_source Allows overriding the category and term of the inventory source. labels Map with labels that decorate the data (metrics, events, inventory) reported by the integration. timeout A number followed by a time unit (ms, s, m or h). An integration that hasn't responded in this time period is killed and restarted. working_dir Working directory for the integration binary. when Integration is only executed if the clause evaluates to true. Conditions are defined below. The remainder of this document describes config properties grouped by their functionality: Select an integration to run Pass configuration to the integration command Configure how the agent executes integrations Select an integration to run There are two properties to select which integration will run: name and exec. The only mandatory property across all on-host integrations is name. The remaining properties specified in this document are optional. Example: integrations: - name: nri-docker - name: my-integration exec: /usr/local/bin/my-integration --metrics --inventory Copy name The mandatory name property can work in two ways: If the exec property is set: The name property only provides an identifier for the integration instance. This identifier is used in log messages and to provide a default inventory category/source in the form integration/<name> (for example, integration/nri-redis). This inventory path can be overridden with the inventory_source configuration option. If the exec property is not set: The agent looks for (and executes) an executable with the name value in any of the following folders: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations Windows C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\bin C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations If there is no executable with this name in the above folders the agent logs an error and the integration is not executed. Important In Windows, do not append the .exe extension to the name. The agent does this for you (for example, name: nri-mysql would look for nri-mysql.exe in the above folders). exec The exec optional property specifies the path, command, and command-line arguments of the integration to execute. When none of the path folders or arguments have spaces, it can be written in a single-line string: - name: my-integration exec: /usr/bin/python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy If any of the path/arguments have spaces that are part of a single element, you can use a YAML array notation: - name: my-integration exec: - C:\\Program Files\\My Integration\\integration.exe - --host - 127.0.0.1 - --port - 8080 Copy The default working directory is the root directory of the agent configuration. It can be overridden with the working_dir property. cli_args The cli_args optional property specifies command line arguments that should be passed to the integration. It is useful when using name as it only provides the integration name identifier (not compatible with exec). - name: my-integration cli_args: [ -interval 10s ] Copy Usual YAML multi-line list format can be used as well: - name: my-integration cli_args: - -interval - 10s Copy when The when property allows to execute the integration only when all the evaluated conditions are successful. Available conditions are: env_exists: Environment variables exist and match value. file_exists: Given file path exists. feature: Provided feature-flag is enabled. Example: integrations: - name: ssh-integration when: file_exists: /var/run/sshd.pid Copy Pass configuration to the integration executable Often integration executables need to receive a configuration to work properly (for example, hostname and port of the monitored system, user credentials, etc.). The Infrastructure agent allows you to configure the integration commands in three ways (which you can combine): Environment variables, using the env property. (recommended) Command-line arguments, passed in the exec property. Configuration files, whose path needs to be passed through environment variables or command-line arguments (see the config) property. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/path/bin/script --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8081 - name: nri-mysql env: STATUS_URL: http://10.0.0.3/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true Copy env The env property allows you to set environment variables that are passed to the executable. It is a key-value map with the required variables. Important New Relic recommends passing env keys in capital letters, as per the example below, for compatibility with all infrastructure agent versions since 1.8.0. If you are using agent version 1.20.0 or above you can use small caps as the agent will automatically uppercase them. Example: integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: DATABASE: postgres PORT: 6432 COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false VERBOSE: 1 Copy If you expect your integration to receive the configuration from the host's environment rather than specifying it explicitly in the configuration file, you need to set the required variables in the Infrastructure agent passthrough_environment global configuration property config This section describes various ways to pass configuration information to an integration. Pass configuration file directly Some integration commands may get their configuration from an external file. If your integration requires a configuration file, nothing prevents you from directly passing its path directly as a command-line argument or an environment variable. Here's an example using configuration of our Flex integration: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: /etc/nri-flex/configs/http-service.yaml - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f /opt/integration/config.properties Copy The above example assumes that the http-service.yaml and config.properties files exist. We can see that the nri-flex integration is expecting the http-service.yaml complete path via the CONFIG_FILE environment variable and the other-integration expects the complete config.properties path after the -f command-line flag. In the above example, it's necessary for the integration installer/configurator that the configuration files exist in the provided path and that the agent and integrations have read permissions on them. Pass configuration through config section If you prefer to keep your configuration file with the rest of the integration configuration, you can use the config section in the integration entry, which can contain a valid YAML object or just a multi-line string: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f ${config.path} config: | example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostname=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy In the above examples, every time the nri-flex integration is executed, the agent creates a temporary file with the following contents: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy The above YAML is only a configuration example for the nri-flex integration. The agent ignores its contents; instead, it creates a temporary file and replaces the ${config.path} variable placeholder with its path. When the integration completes execution the temporary file is removed. Also, the agent creates another temporary file before executing the other-integration integration: example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostid=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy It replaces the -f ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary path of the written file. By convention, if you do not place the ${config.path} variable in any command-line argument or environment variable value, the agent passes the path of the configuration file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable: # assuming that nri-example command is prepared to receive the configuration # file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable integrations: - name: nri-example config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy Pass secrets and discovery through config section The main benefit for using a config section instead of hardcoding the full path of an external file is that you can insert ${variable} placeholders to apply our auto-discovery feature and secrets management. Here's an example followed by some explanations: variables: my_credentials: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token discovery: docker: match: label.service: foo integrations: - name: foo-monitor exec: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=${config.path} config: | foo.host=${discovery.ip} foo.port=${discovery.port} foo.user=${my_credentials.user} foo.password=${my_credentials.password} Copy Tip (For more details about the variables and discovery sections, please visit the discovery and secrets management documentation). The above example relies on the following premises: There is a Vault service that allows retrieving a JSON object formed by the user and password fields. There may be a variable number of Docker containers labeled with service=foo, which are accessible from the agent host via a discoverable public IP and Port. The user has configured the foo-monitor integration to monitor all the service=foo labeled containers, which share a common user and password. Each instance of the foo-monitor integration requires executing the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable, passing the text configuration inside the config section via the --config=<path> command-line argument. As example of workflow, imagine that the Vault invocation returns the following JSON: {\"user\":\"monitorer\",\"password\":\"5up3r53cr3t!\"} Copy At the moment of executing the foo-monitor integration, there are three running containers labeled with service=foo: ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8080 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8081 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8082 The agent then creates the following three temporary files, using the contents of the config property as a template, but replacing the ${placeholders} by the acquired variables and discovered items (files' path is invented for the sake of simplicity): First match (/tmp/123_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8080 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t!

Copy Third match (/tmp/789_discovered) foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8082 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy After the config variable placeholders have been replaced and the temporary files have been created, the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable is executed three times (one per matched container), replacing the ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary file corresponding to each discovered configuration: First match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/123_discovered Second match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/456_discovered Third match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/789_discovered To ensure security and to minimize the chance of leaking secrets to disk, the agent: Creates the files owned by the agent user, for example, root or nri-agent, depending on the user you have configured to run the agent. Sets read permissions only for the owner. Removes the created files when the integration instance finishes its execution. config_template_path If you want to use the secrets management and discovery in the configuration files that you're passing to the integration executable, but you prefer to keep them as an individual file, you can use the config_template_path: <path> option. It works exactly as in the config section: The agent applies secrets management and discovery to the file contents. The agent creates different temporary files that are passed to the integration via the ${config.path} placeholder (or the CONFIG_PATH environment variable). Example: discovery: docker: match: name: /^redis/ integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config_template_path: /etc/flex-configs/redis.yml Copy In the above example, the redis.yml external file can contain container discovery variable placeholders, like ${discovery.ip} or ${discovery.port}. Configure how the agent executes your integrations The properties of this section modify the way the Infrastructure agent executes and interacts with the integrations, or the way the agent decorates the integrations' data. integration_user The integration commands run as the same user as the agent (usually root or nri-agent). If due to permission restrictions an integration needs to run as another user, its name must be specified in the integration_user property. Example: integrations: - name: dbus-inventory exec: python my-dbus-script.py integration_user: dbus Copy interval The interval option sets the time between consecutive executions of an integration. The accepted format is an integer immediately followed by a time unit (s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). The default is 30s, and the minimum accepted value is 15s. Any value lower than 15s is automatically set to 15s. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover interval: 20s Copy inventory_source Any inventory item must be catalogued under a category/source taxonomy. By default, each integration inventory is stored as integration/ + name value (for example, integration/nri-apache, integration/nri-mysql). The inventory_source property allows you to override the default taxonomy of inventory data. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx - name: nri-apache exec: - /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/nri-apache - --inventory inventory_source: config/apache Copy In the above example, the nri-nginx inventory, if any, would be visible in the New Relic UI under the integration/nri-nginx source. The nri-apache inventory would be visible under config/apache. labels labels is a key-value map that allows extra metadata to be provided for the integration. The agent uses those labels to decorate the metrics, events, and inventory that it receives from a given integration instance. Example: integrations: - name: nri-apache inventory_source: config/apache labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy In the above example, the agent decorates all the metrics and events from the nri-apache instance with the following fields: label.env: production label.role: load_balancer Also, the following entries are added to the integration inventory: config/apache/labels/env: production config/apache/labels/role: load_balancer timeout If an integration has not returned any metric (or a heartbeat message as described below) before the time specified in the timeout value, the agent kills the integration process and restarts it after the corresponding interval. The accepted format is an integer number immediately followed (without spaces) by a time unit (ms for milliseconds, s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). If a zero (or negative) timeout value is provided, the integration can run forever without being killed by a timeout expiration. For long-running integrations (integrations that keep running, periodically returning metrics/events/inventory), each time the integration submits a metrics/events/inventory payload, the timeout deadline is restarted. That means that long-running integrations must return a valid JSON payload in an interval that is lower than timeout. Returning an empty JSON ({}) is interpreted as a heart-beat message that restarts the timeout, preventing the long-running integration from being killed, even if they don't have information to report. The default is 120s, and the minimum accepted value is 100ms. Any value lower than 100ms is automatically set to 100ms. Example: integrations: - name: nri-jmx cli_args: JMX_HOST: jmx-host.localnet JMX_PORT: 7096 COLLECTION_FILES: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml\" timeout: 30s Copy working_dir working_dir sets the working directory of the command. If empty or unspecified, the agent runs the command in the Infrastructure agent's current directory. The default is the Infrastructure agent root directory. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/integration/bin/integration working_dir: /opt/integration/scratch-zone Copy Update older integration configuration In December 2019, the Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began using a different configuration format. For details, see Config format differences. The main difference between these formats is that the older configuration format uses two separate configuration files (a INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml file and a INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml file) and the newer version uses a single configuration file. Here are some of the features added by the newer configuration functionality: Flexible configuration via command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files. Ability to group different integrations in the same file. Hot reload: adding a new integration or changing its configuration does not require restarting the agent. Timeouts: if an integration doesn't respond before a user-specified time, the integration process is killed and restarted. Not all on-host integrations come with the newer configuration format, but you can update the configuration to the new format for all on-host integrations to take advantage of the new features. The following YAML shows an example Apache integration configuration using the older configuration format. Note that this configuration will still work with newer agents, but we recommend updating your integrations to take full advantage of features. integration_name: com.newrelic.apache instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy To update an older integration configuration to the new format, you must perform two steps: Rename the instances top-level section to integrations. Remove the integration_name top-level section and add it to each integration entry. You are no longer required to keep a separate file for each integration type and you can group your legacy integration entries in the same file as other integrations. The new version of the Apache integration config: integrations: - name: nri-apache env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-apache env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/apache Copy Please note that because the older configuration format doesn't support hot reloading. You will need to restart the Infrastructure agent to remove the old integrations configuration (otherwise the old instances will coexist with the new ones).",

A member of the Docs team will review your pull request and comment with any feedback. Once we've merged your pull request into the Develop branch, your changes will go live with our next deploy (usually within a few hours). Create new docs You can use article templates or clone an existing doc as a template. To create a new doc: Clone the repo on your computer. In /src/content/docs/, find a good location for your doc. Using your text editor, create a new .mdx file or copy an existing doc. Write your content. Optional: Add your doc to the right nav .yml file. The navigation files can be a bit hard to work with, so feel free to leave this step for a Docs writer to handle when they review your pull request. Commit your changes and create a pull request. The Tech Docs team has two heroes watching for new pull requests. We'll help you get the content finalized and make sure that it's in the right place. Clone (copy) an existing doc Once you've cloned the docs-website repository, use your text editor to copy an existing doc. Rename and edit the copy and then save it as a new doc. Your cloned doc automatically inherits the original doc's frontmatter content. Make sure to change that, too. If you want your cloned doc to be translated, follow standard procedures to request translation. For bigger projects If you're making larger changes like adding a whole new doc or editing many existing docs, it can be helpful to run the site locally. For instructions, see Tech writer workflow.

      "body": "Sliding windows are a technique for generating charts using the SLIDE BY clause in conjunction with the TIMESERIES clause. With sliding windows, data is gathered in time \"windows\" that overlap with each other. For example, in the image below, a query gathers data with 5 minute windows. The windows \"slide\" by 1 minute. Each window overlaps with the previous window by 4 minutes. 5-minute windows with 1-minute \"slide\" In contrast, with \"tumbling\" or \"cascading\" windows, the windows do not overlap. For example, in this TIMESERIES 3 minutes NRQL query, the windows are 3 minutes in length, with each beginning when the other ends. There is no overlap in the measurement interval. 3-minute windows with no overlap or \"slide\". When to use sliding windows Sliding windows are helpful when you need to smooth out \"spiky\" charts. One common use case is to use sliding windows to smooth line graphs that have a lot of variation over short periods of time in cases where the rolling aggregate (for example a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. In the example below, data varies greatly from one minute to another, so the 1-minute tumbling window chart shows many high peaks and low valleys. TIMESERIES query without SLIDE BY clause However, in this example, 5-minute wide TIMESERIES windows are smoothed with the help of 1-minute SLIDE BY intervals. The query returns similar data but creates a much smoother chart. TIMESERIES query with SLIDE BY clause Valid NRQL syntax for SLIDE BY Valid NRQL syntax for the SLIDE BY clause will follow the format below. SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer1 units SLIDE BY integer2 units Copy integer1 specifies the sliding window width and integer2 specifies the SLIDE BY interval. units is a time unit, such as second, minute, hour, or day. All standard NRQL time units are accepted. Here’s a real-life example. It shows 5-minute TIMESERIES windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval. SELECT average(duration) from Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy Translation from PromQL-style queries When applicable, a PromQL-style query is translated into a NRQL sliding window query. For example, if your PromQL style query uses rate(request_count[5m]) for the past 60 minutes with a 1-minute window overlap, the NRQL translation would be the query below. SELECT rate(sum(request_count), 1 SECONDS) FROM Metric SINCE 3600 SECONDS AGO UNTIL NOW FACET dimensions() LIMIT 100 TIMESERIES 300000 SLIDE BY 60000 Copy In the translation output, the default unit of millisecond is used for TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY clauses. For TIMESERIES, 300000 ms is 300 seconds, or 5 minutes, specifying a window size of 5 minutes. For SLIDE BY, 60000 ms is 60 seconds, specifying a slide interval of 1 minute. Use SLIDE BY with MAX and AUTO You can combine SLIDE BY with MAX and AUTO arguments to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy Tip When paired with SLIDE BY, TIMESERIES does not support AUTO or MAX. The TIMESERIES value must be an integer time unit value. In other words, SLIDE BY AUTO or SLIDE BY MAX will work, but TIMESERIES AUTO or TIMESERIES MAX followed by SLIDE BY and MAX, AUTO, or a specific integer time unit is not supported. Tip The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which will show up as gaps and unexpected results. If you experience these issues with query results, consider checking for instances of SLIDE BY where the step interval exceeds the window size.",

      "body": "When you're creating a new doc, there's a lot to keep track of. You can use this checklist to make sure you've done everything. Title Check that: The doc's title effectively describes the contents. Procedural doc titles use active verbs; for example, Install not Installing. Introduction Check that: The introduction leads with an outcome and provides an overview of how to get there, so customers are confident they've found the right doc. It provides a short, readable overview of the doc's contents. Headings (H2s) Check that: Heading names are concise, yet provide information that helps readers to skim or skip to the section they want. Procedural H2s use active verbs, not the ing verb form. Text Check that the text: Optimizes for easier translation: Avoid idioms, slang, specific cultural references, etc. Tells a good story: Promotes the platform (other New Relic products, alerting, etc.). Includes examples and use cases, identifies personas, explains not only what it is or how to use it but why it matters. Includes hyperlinks in UI paths. Has no typos. Procedures Procedures use active voice and focus on steps (\"do this\"). Avoid burying tips or extra details in the steps. If the procedure includes prerequisites or background information, that information appears before (not buried inside) the ordered list of procedures. If a procedure or step branches, it splits the options so they are clearly visible as bullets, collapsers, etc. If the procedure says what not to do, it also describes what to do instead. Example: What not to do and what to do instead Do not monitor your own applications from the partnership owner account. Instead, create an account within the partnership, and monitor apps from that account. Structure The original tech writer or docs site contributor is the best judge of whether the draft doc is complete. However, in your peer edit, make notes if you have unanswered questions that aren't addressed within the doc or its cross references. Doc structure Comments Complete Check that the overall doc: Is complete, but stays on topic. Includes useful cross references, hyperlinks, and other suggestions to enhance the information, especially for SEO. Skimmable Readers can see at a glance what the doc is about and what to do. It's obvious what parts they can read and what parts they can skip. Visually clean The doc avoids excessive use of callouts, long sentences, or long paragraphs. Useful images For screenshots and images, check that: Full size images always have captions to explain their relevance. UI paths in captions always have hyperlinks. Cropped images clearly show their relevance, with or without captions. In addition, make sure that screenshots and images follow the docs site's security guidelines, and that no private information related to customers or New Relic is displayed. Levels of detail The doc uses H2s, H3s, bullets, tables, and clamshells to organize complex levels of information.",

      "body": "We welcome your contributions, whether you are a New Relic employee or a New Relic user! And we don't want you to worry about style. When you edit a file, tech writers on our team review it for style, grammar, and formatting. That said, if you're curious about our style guidelines, you're welcome (but not obligated) to take a look. Edit a doc If you see a minor problem in our documentation that you want to quickly fix, you can use GitHub to edit the file and submit your pull request. A member of the Docs team will review your edit and publish your changes. We'll follow up with you if we have any questions. To edit existing content without building the site locally: On the docs site, navigate to the doc you'd like to edit. Click Edit page on the top corner of the right nav. A GitHub page will open with the source of the doc. Click the pencil icon in the top right. Make your edits (don't worry too much about formatting or grammar, we're happy to take care of that). At the bottom of the page, enter acommit message that describes your change, then click Commit changes. Follow the prompts to submit your pull request. A member of the Docs team will review your pull request and comment with any feedback. Once we've merged your pull request into the Develop branch, your changes will go live with our next deploy (usually within a few hours). Create new docs You can use article templates or clone an existing doc as a template. To create a new doc: Clone the repo on your computer. In /src/content/docs/, find a good location for your doc. Using your text editor, create a new .mdx file or copy an existing doc. Write your content. Optional: Add your doc to the right nav .yml file. The navigation files can be a bit hard to work with, so feel free to leave this step for a Docs writer to handle when they review your pull request. Commit your changes and create a pull request. The Tech Docs team has two heroes watching for new pull requests. We'll help you get the content finalized and make sure that it's in the right place. Clone (copy) an existing doc Once you've cloned the docs-website repository, use your text editor to copy an existing doc. Rename and edit the copy and then save it as a new doc. Your cloned doc automatically inherits the original doc's frontmatter content. Make sure to change that, too. If you want your cloned doc to be translated, follow standard procedures to request translation. For bigger projects If you're making larger changes like adding a whole new doc or editing many existing docs, it can be helpful to run the site locally. For instructions, see Tech writer workflow. Delete pages If you are comfortable with deleting the page yourself, go for it. If not, ask us by: File an issue in the docs-website repo, or contact the @hero in the #documentation channel if you're a New Relic employee. We'll take a look at your issue and help out. Private edits If you need to stage content for a private beta or limited release, contact the docs hero in the #documentation Slack channel. Request a future publication date (for New Relic employees) If your draft needs to be released on a specific date or within a specific timeframe (for example, right before a release), contact the Tech Docs @hero in the #documentation Slack channel. If you're not a New Relic employee, please create a GitHub issue.",

      "body": "This document will guide you through the entire workflow for editing the New Relic documentation site as a New Relic Tech Docs Writer. Resources VSCode (or another text editor) VSCode has great GitHub integrations GitHub account GitHub Desktop Edit in the GitHub web editor vs local build Need to edit a doc? Use this table to decide where to work! Use the GitHub web editor for: Use the local build for: Adding content to one doc: Rewriting sentences, or 1-2 lines Editing small amounts of content: updating URLs, deleting typos, etc. Brand new docs Rewrites of more than 1 or 2 lines Any updates to doc frontmatter Title changes Taxonomy changes Metadescription updates Redirects Updating images Editing multiple docs at once Continue reading for instructions on how to edit a doc locally. 1. Set up your local environment Running the site locally makes testing and previewing large changes much easier. Here's how to get setup: Install GitHub Desktop Sign in to GitHub Desktop. On Macs, click on GitHub Desktop in the top left corner of your screen and select Preferences. Select the blue Sign In button and follow the prompts in the browser window. Navigate to the Docs Site repository on GitHub.com. Click the green Code button and then select Open with GitHub Desktop. Choose the location where you want the repo, and this will clone the entire repository to your local machine at the designated path. You can ensure the repo was cloned by navigating to your local GitHub folder (the default is ~/Documents/github). Once you have cloned the repo, you don't need to clone it again in the future. 2. Run the site locally Build the site locally using the terminal to preview changes before opening a Pull Request. While it's highly recommended to build the site locally, this is technically an optional step. The site will automatically reflect any local changes once build. Node and Yarn are tools used to build the site on your local machine. Prerequisites Install Node Install Yarn npm install -g yarn Build the site In your terminal, go to your cloned repo, docs-website. For example: cd ~/Documents/github/docs-website Run yarn with the following commands: yarn && yarn start The site will take a few minutes to build. Make yourself some tea or coffee. Once it's built, you can access your preview site in your browser by navigating to http://localhost:8000/ 3. Edit a doc Once your local environment and branch are set up, you're ready to edit a doc. Check out the style guide for writing guidelines. First, ensure your Current Branch in GitHub Desktop is set to the correct branch, not Develop. Navigate to the doc you want to edit in Finder. If I wanted to edit a Python agent doc, I would navigate to: ~/Documents/github/docs-website/src/content/docs/agents/python-agent/hosting-services/python-agent-stackato.mdx Edit the doc in your text editor of choice. You should write docs in markdown language. Reference the style guide for help with formatting markdown Save the file with your edits, then follow the same process for any other docs you wish to edit. 4. Commit your changes Once your edits are done, you can commit them. This stages your changes, which you will later push upstream to Github. By pushing your changes, everyone will have access to your branch and commits. Navigate to GitHub Desktop. The left column should have a record of all the edits you have made to docs. In the bottom left corner, name your commit and add a good description of your edits. It should be descriptive enough to ensure that someone can understand all the changes made by simply scanning this description. Click Commit to [yourbranchname] 5. Publish your commits Once you have committed your changes, you're almost ready to open your Pull Request. First, you need to ensure your branch is pushed upstream. On GitHub desktop, click the blue Publish Branch button if available. If you don't see the Publish Branch, click the blue Push Origin button. This will push all your commits upstream and make them available to everyone else through the GitHub repository. 6. Open your pull request Now that your commits are available to everyone, you need to notify people that your changes are ready to be merged into the develop branch. To do this, you open a pull request: On GitHub Desktop, click the blue Create Pull Request button. This will open GitHub in your browser, and prompt you to fill in your pull request. Ensure you're merging from your branch into either the main or develop branch. If you scroll down, you can review all your commits to ensure they reflect all your changes. Just like your commit description, your pull request description should be detailed and give the full context of your changes. Feel free to add any additional context here (issue or Jira number, SMEs, etc.) To request a review from another Tech Writer: in GitHub open the PR, navigate to the Conversation section, and then select or type in a reviewer name in the Reviewer section. Add any relevant labels to your PR. If you do not add from_tw, the PR will not be automatically assigned to another writer for review. Once you're satisfied with your pull request, click the green Create pull request button. You can either publish the changes directly by approving the pull request yourself, or you can request for another Tech Writer to peer edit it. At the bottom of the pull request page, you will see a Checks section. These checks ensure your PR doesn't break the build process of the site. Ensure all checks marked required pass before merging. Once the pull request has passed the checks and it has been approved by another tech writer (or you are confident the changes are ready to be published), click the green Merge pull request button. This will merge your branch and commits into the repository and will begin the build process. If you don't add the from_tw label when you first create a PR, it will not automatically assign a reviewer. If you forget to add the label before opening the PR: Add the from_tw label. Turn the PR into a draft PR. Select the PR is ready for review button at the bottom of the page to reopen the PR. The PR should now have a reviewer. Preview a doc There are two main ways to preview branches you’ve already published and run commits on: Local: Quicker, but requires a semi-substantial amount of setup and familiarity with a terminal. Gatsby Cloud: Full preview of the live site with no overhead, and a very convenient way to share a preview of your draft with a SME. Gatsby Cloud will comment on your PR with a link to a preview version of the site once the build is ready. Building the site generally takes about 15 minutes, but can sometimes take longer if there are a lot of changes. Revise and publish a doc If you’re notified that a reviewer has submitted a review to your file, go to your PR and review the changes. You might see them in the diff view, if they’re part of a review with comments; otherwise, they might appear as copy edits in the file. Respond to any comments in the file. Either reply with follow up discussion, or click Resolve conversation. When you’ve resolved all the comments, and all of the automatic checks have passed, you can merge the pull request. Merging the pull request sets in motion the automated build process and your changes will be published shortly. Note: You will only be able to merge when the Merge pull request button is green. If it’s not green, review for any comments you missed, or other messages that indicate why GitHub is blocking you from merging. Revert merging Remember that you can almost always undo things. If you merge a PR, and then find that you shouldn’t have, you can unmerge with the Revert button. On the Pull requests tab in GitHub, click Closed on the tally bar to see all the issues and PRs that have alredy been merged. Locate the PR you merged, and locate the Revert button. Click Revert. That creates a new PR, which needs to be merged. If you want to reopen it, you need to follow the link back to the original PR and either revert that or reopen it. Writers only: Work on a branch, not a fork Some teams work on branches, some teams work on forks; the Docs team works in branches. As long as a branch has been pushed upstream, this allows us to work collaboratively and ensure that no work is ever lost when someone goes on vacation. To create a branch on the docs-website repo: Open GitHub Desktop Click on Current branch: xxx Click on New Branch You will be prompted to name your new branch. Descriptive names are best. It's a great way to quickly clue people in to what your work is all about. For example, if you are working on What’s New pages, you might name the branch Whats-new-updates. When you create a new branch, don't forget to add the Jira issue's key (DOC-1234) to the branch name and the PR title.",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. This document explains the older, legacy configuration format. Important New Relic recommends using the new standard improved configuration format. To update your configuration file to this new format, check the update section For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration file structure An on-host integration that uses the standard configuration format requires two configuration files: A definition file A configuration file Definition file The definition file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml. This file provides descriptive information about the integration, such as: the version of the JSON protocol it supports, a list of commands it can execute, and arguments that it accepts. It lives in this directory: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations Copy Here's an example of an NGINX integration definition file with two command sections on a Linux system: name: com.myorg.nginx protocol_version: 2 description: Collect metric and configuration data from NGINX os: linux commands: metrics: command: - myorg-nginx - --metrics interval: 15 inventory: command: - myorg-nginx - --inventory interval: 120 prefix: integration/myorg-nginx Copy A definition file can be broken down into two parts: The header The commands section Definition file header Here are explanations of a definition file's header elements: Definition header field Description name Required. A unique name name to identify the integration for logging, internal metrics, etc. When the agent loads the config file, New Relic uses the name to look up the integration in the agent's registry. protocol_version Required. The version number of the protocol. New Relic uses this to ensure compatibility between the integration and the agent. If the agent does not recognize an integration's version, it will filter out that integration and create a log message. The current version of the JSON protocol is 2. For more on protocol changes, see SDK changes. description Optional. Human-friendly explanation of what the integration does. os Optional. The operating system where the integration runs. New Relic uses this to filter integrations that you intend to run only on specific operating systems. Default: Run the integration regardless of the os value. To restrict the integration to a specific operating system, use either of these options: linux windows Definition file commands After the header is a list of commands. The commands section defines: One or more independent operating modes for the executable The runtime data required for it to be executed The commands section is a YAML map of command definitions, where each key is the unique alias name of the command in the integration's config file that specifies the executable to run. Definition commands Description command Required. The actual command line to be executed as a YAML array of command parts. These are assembled to run the actual command. For simple commands, the array might be only a single element. Additional command rules include: command arguments: The command and any command line arguments that are shared for all instances of the integration configuration. command execution: The command will be executed in the same directory as the definition file. command path: Any commands available on the host's $PATH can be used. Executables located in the same directory as the definition file, or in a subdirectory of it, can be executed using a relative path. For example: Linux: To run an executable called myorg-nginx in the same directory as the definition file, you could use myorg-nginx or ./myorg-nginx. Linux systems will execute myorg-nginx as if the user used ./myorg-nginx. Windows: To run an executable called myorg-nginx.exe in the same directory as the definition file, you could use \\myorg-nginx.exe or .\\myorg-nginx.exe. Windows systems writing myorg-nginx.exe will be executed as if indicating the current path: .\\myorg-nginx.exe. To use a command installed inside a directory on the host's $PATH, simply use the command name. Example: python. To run any other executable which is neither on the host's $PATH nor within the integration's directory, use an absolute path to the executable. Example: /opt/jdk/bin/java. If the given executable name exists within the integration's directory but also exists elsewhere on the system $PATH, the version in the integration's directory takes precedence. interval Optional. The number of seconds between two consecutive executions of the command, in particular between the end of the previous execution and the start of the next execution. Default for metric polling: 30 seconds. Minimum (floor): 15 seconds. Alerts: For metrics being used for alerts, use an interval of 30 seconds or less. prefix Optional. The categorization of the inventory in the form of category/short_integration_name. Example: integration/myorg-nginx. The prefix is not a platform-specific path. The forward slash is the correct separator between the category and short_integration_name. The prefix can have a maximum of two levels. Otherwise inventory will not be reported. Default value if not set: integration/integration_name. Configuration file The configuration file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml. This file specifies which executables to run and the parameters required to run them. It lives in this directory: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d Copy Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Here's an example of a config file with one instance defined. Explanations of these fields are explained below the example. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Another example of a config file with two instances defined. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://one.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer - name: nginx2.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://another.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Config file field definitions Config file field Description integration_name Required. This is the header and is used to identify which executables to run. This name must exactly match the name specified in the integration's definition file. Recommendation: To ensure unique names, use reverse domain name notation. name Required. This is the name for the specific invocation (instance) of the integration. This is used to help identify any log messages generated by this integration and is also useful for troubleshooting. command Required. This is the command to be executed. This must exactly match one of the unique alias names specified in the integration's definition file. arguments Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The argument name. Transformed to upper case when set as environment variable. Values: The argument values. Passed through as is. The arguments are made available to an integration as a set of environment variables. Arguments in the config file cannot be capitalised and should use underscores to separate words. labels Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The label name. Values: The defined label value. integration_user Optional. String with the name the agent will use for executing the integration binary. Default: depends on the usermode. By default, integrations are executed with the same user that's running the integration agent, nri-agent for privileged and unprivileged mode and root user for root mode. When present, the Infrastructure agent will execute the integration binary as the specified user. For example, to run the integration binary as the root user when running the agent in a usermode different than root, just add integration_user: root to the configuration file.",

Several reasons for this: 1) The important part of showing an example config file is to show the overall structure of the file, 2) Usually the number of config options present in a file will vary based on whatever the customer wishes to use, so using <var> tags can actually be confusing as it implies that these values must be present. Instrumentation procedure (at bottom of the Java section): the var tag wouldn't be necessary because it's an example, not part of a procedure, and the main goal is seeing the general structure. Also, because it's an example of app code, the concept of user-specific values doesn't have much meaning, because the entire code will vary dependent on how the customer has written their code. (If anything, this would be a potential for using <mark> format to emphasize the New Relic functions.) Response/output code: If the code is meant to show an expected return, and is not related to a procedure, then var tags shouldn't be used. Here's a doc section (the returned JSON) where var tags are not needed. For an example of a doc section with both <var> formatting and without it, see the Synthetics monitors REST API example. The first block shows a command they might choose to run, hence it uses a <var> tag. The second block is just an example output, showing the structure that would be returned; it doesn't require a <var> tag. For some use cases, highlighting may be a better choice than a var tag. var format examples Below are some general style recommendations for formatting user-specific <var> values. <var> tag formatting may vary based on language- or system-specific expectations, so be sure check the style used in the documentation section in question, and to ask relevant SMEs what they think of the style. Account IDs and other IDs/#s: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID, YOUR_API_CODE, etc. This should be the general style used. URLs: example.com, or maybe YOUR_URL Paths: PATH/TO/SOMETHING.exe or maybe PATH_TO_FILE Emails: datanerd@example.com or maybe YOUR_EMAIL Bash variables for REST API code: Some <var> tagged code values on the docs site have the form $ { API_KEY}. This is a format used for variables in bash scripts, where users assign values to specific variable names and then call those variables later in the script by using the $VARIABLE_NAME. For more info, see this explanation of bash variables. Important The bash variable style is currently used in the REST API docs and in some Synthetics docs and that's fine. But going forward we should use the general variable style (without the $ and &lt; >). mark: Emphasize non-procedure code snippets Highlighting (<mark>) is used for when you want to draw attention to a variable or value, but it's not something directly procedural related. Here are two examples of highlighting: Highlighting values in code response that are meant for later use: Activate Azure integrations doc.

For the doc title (the field at top of page): Doc should be named in a practical, use-case-focused way. Example: Add custom attributes to transactions Introduction (this heading will not be visible) Provide a brief explanation of what this document will teach customers, and why it is valuable for customers to know how to do that. Focus on the value the API provides to the customers and mention specific, common use cases. Any relevant notes about support/compatability should go here, too. Here's an example from the Java API asynchronous tutorial doc: New Relic for Java includes an API to instrument asynchronous activity. For supported frameworks, the Java agent usually instruments async work automatically. However, the async API can be useful for adding more detail to your data. This document provides examples of using tokens and segments to instrument your app. Optional: Provide an overview for complex processes This is an optional section for complicated tutorials that involve either using several methods in one procedure or that have different alternate steps you can take to achieve similar results. This section can link to lower-down sections to allow users to skip around as needed. For simple tutorials, this section isn't necessary. For an example, see this section of the Java async tutorial. Provide a procedure to accomplish the task Tell the user how to accomplish the task, and link to the methods necessary to accomplish that task. As much as possible, we're looking to describe tasks in \"procedures\" (procedure is tech writer jargon for a series of numbered steps). This may be tough to do for fairly open-ended/variable tasks, but it will usually be possible to chunk the content at a fairly high-level to make it into a procedure. Along the way, explain what the importance of the procedure step is, and how one might verify that the step was done correctly. For code samples, avoid using large chunks of code. Instead, use smaller pieces of code and give context for how they are being used. (If you think a large app code example would be helpful, place that later in the doc in the Example section.) Tip For an example of an open-ended task segmented into procedural chunks, see the Asynchronous doc section Connecting async threads. For another example, see this TomCat GAE Flex procedure. Base your procedure on the simple structure below. Tech writers will edit your content to match our style and formatting requirements: Step 1. Do something... Methods and example code to implement the first step. For each step, if applicable, indicate the significance of that step (why it's important) and how the user might verify that the step was done correctly (for example, something showing up in UI, or running a verification test of some sort). If needed: Step 2. Do something else... Methods and example code to implement step 2. If needed: Step 3. Do something else... Methods and example code to implement step 3. Last step. Verify that the task was completed... Explain how a user would know they'd completed the task correctly. In particular, how would the user find the new change or data in the New Relic UI. What NR products and pages would the change be noticed on? If new data shows up in Insights, what event types can it be found under? Optional: Do something else with the API Same as above. Make as many headings and separate procedures as needed. Optional: Large example code block If you think a large app code example would be useful, place here. Within any code block, explain all New Relic functions/methods, not just the main methods. Instead of in-line comments, consider using highlighted sections underneath the code block to give additional context. Here's an example: Code block example The following code example shows a segment starting in the storeItem method to measure how long the Lambda statement is waiting in the thread pool. To stop timing the segment, you must call either .end() or .ignore(). If you don't want to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .ignore(). Otherwise, to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .end(). private void storeItem(long id) { Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). startSegment(\"storeItem\") ; segment. reportAsExternal (DatastoreParameters .product(\"H2\") .collection(null) .operation(\"insert\") .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) .databaseName(\"test\") .build()); // fire and forget DB_POOL.submit(() -> { segment.end(); insertData(id); }); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: startSegment(...): Begins the segment that will time the code. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters()): Associates the time with a datastore external call This will show up in APM with datastore data. For more information, see reportAsExternal API. segment.end(): Stops timing this segment. For more on this method, see the Javadoc.

For more information, see this New Relic blog post. You can quickly start monitoring Kubernetes clusters using Auto-telemetry with Pixie, which is currently a beta release. This Pixie integration into New Relic does not require a language agent. Learn more about Auto-telemetry with Pixie here. Tip Our Kubernetes metadata injection project is open source. Here's the code to link APM and infrastructure data and the code to automatically manage certificates. Compatibility and requirements Before linking Kubernetes metadata to your APM agents, make sure you meet the following requirements: Kubernetes requirements Network requirements APM agent compatibility OpenShift requirements Kubernetes requirements To link your applications and Kubernetes, your cluster must have the MutatingAdmissionWebhook controller enabled, which requires Kubernetes 1.9 or higher. To verify that your cluster is compatible, run the following command: kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1 Copy If you see a different result, follow the Kubernetes documentation to enable admission control in your cluster. Network requirements For Kubernetes to speak to our MutatingAdmissionWebhook, the master node (or the API server container, depending on how the cluster is set up) should be allowed egress for HTTPS traffic on port 443 to pods in all of the other nodes in the cluster. This might require specific configuration depending on how the infrastructure is set up (on-premises, AWS, Google Cloud, etc). Tip Until Kubernetes v1.14, users were only allowed to register admission webhooks on port 443. Since v1.15 it's possible to register them on different ports. To ensure backward compatibility, the webhook is registered by default on port 443 in the YAML config file we distribute. APM agent compatibility The following New Relic agents collect Kubernetes metadata: Go 2.3.0 or higher Java 4.10.0 or higher Node.js 5.3.0 or higher Python 4.14.0 or higher Ruby 6.1.0 or higher .NET 8.17.438 or higher Openshift requirements To link Openshift and Kubernetes you must enable mutating admission webhooks, which requires Openshift 3.9 or higher. During the process, install a resource that requires admin permissions to the cluster. Run this to log in as admin: oc login -u system:admin Copy Check that webhooks are correctly configured. If they are not, update the master-config.yaml file. admissionConfig: pluginConfig: MutatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission ValidatingAdmissionWebhook: configuration: apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1 kubeConfigFile: /dev/null kind: WebhookAdmission location: \"\" Copy Important Add kubeConfigFile: /dev/null to address some issues in Openshift. Enable certificate signing by editing the YAML file and updating your configuration: kubernetesMasterConfig: controllerArguments: cluster-signing-cert-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.crt\" cluster-signing-key-file: - \"/etc/origin/master/ca.key\" Copy Restart the Openshift services in the master node. Configure the injection of metadata By default, all the pods you create that include APM agents have the correct environment variables set and the metadata injection applies to the entire cluster. To check that the environment variables have been set, any container that is running must be stopped, and a new instance started (see Validate the injection of metadata). This default configuration also uses the Kubernetes certificates API to automatically manage the certificates required for the injection. If needed, you can limit the injection of metadata to specific namespaces in your cluster or self-manage your certificates. Default configuration To proceed with the default injection of metadata, follow these steps: Download the YAML file: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Custom configuration You can limit the injection of metadata only to specific namespaces by using labels. To enable this feature, edit your YAML file by finding and uncommenting the following lines: # namespaceSelector: # matchLabels: # newrelic-metadata-injection: enabled Copy With this option, injection is only applied to those namespaces that have the newrelic-metadata-injection label set to enabled: kubectl label namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE newrelic-metadata-injection=enabled Copy Manage custom certificates To use custom certificates you need a specific YAML file: Download the YAML file without automatic certificate management: curl -O http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/kubernetes/k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Replace YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME with the name of your cluster in the YAML file. Apply the YAML file to your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl apply -f k8s-metadata-injection-custom-certs-latest.yaml Copy Once you have the correct YAML file, you can proceed with the custom certificate management option. You need your certificate, server key, and Certification Authority (CA) bundle encoded in PEM format. If you have them in the standard certificate format (X.509), install openssl, and run the following: openssl x509 -in CERTIFICATE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out CERTIFICATE_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in SERVER_KEY_FILENAME -outform PEM -out SERVER_KEY_FILENAME.pem openssl x509 -in CA_BUNDLE_FILENAME -outform PEM -out BUNDLE_FILENAME.pem Copy If your certificate/key pair are in another format, see the Digicert knowledgebase for more help. Create the TLS secret with the signed certificate/key pair, and patch the mutating webhook configuration with the CA using the following commands: kubectl create secret tls newrelic-metadata-injection-secret \\ --key=PEM_ENCODED_SERVER_KEY \\ --cert=PEM_ENCODED_CERTIFICATE \\ --dry-run -o yaml | kubectl -n default apply -f - caBundle=$(cat PEM_ENCODED_CA_BUNDLE | base64 | td -d '\\n') kubectl patch mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg --type='json' -p \"[{'op': 'replace', 'path': '/webhooks/0/clientConfig/caBundle', 'value':'${caBundle}'}]\" Copy Important Certificates signed by Kubernetes have an expiration of one year. For more information, see the Kubernetes source code in GitHub. Validate the injection of metadata In order to validate that the webhook (responsible for injecting the metadata) was installed correctly, deploy a new pod and check for the New Relic environment variables. Create a dummy pod containing Busybox by running: kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Check if New Relic environment variables were injected: kubectl exec busybox0 -- env | grep NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME=fsi NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME=nodea NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME=default NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME=busybox0 NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME=busybox Copy Disable the injection of metadata To disable/uninstall the injection of metadata, use the following commands: Delete the Kubernetes objects using the yaml file: kubectl delete -f k8s-metadata-injection-latest.yaml Copy Delete the TLS secret containing the certificate/key pair: kubectl delete secret/newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Troubleshooting Follow these troubleshooting tips as needed. No Kubernetes metadata in APM or distributed tracing transactions Problem The creation of the secret by the k8s-webhook-cert-manager job used to fail due to the kubectl version used by the image when running in Kubernetes version 1.19.x, The new version 1.3.2 fixes this issue, therefore it is enough to run again the job using an update version of the image to fix the issue. Solution Update the image k8s-webhook-cert-manager (to a version >= 1.3.2) and re-run the job. The secret will be correctly created and the k8s-metadata-injection pod will be able to start. Note that the new version of the manifest and of the nri-bundle are already updated with the correct version of the image. Problem In OpenShift version 4.x, the CA that is used in order to patch the mutatingwebhookconfiguration resource is not the one used when signing the certificates. This is a known issue currently tracked here. In the logs of the Pod nri-metadata-injection, you'll see the following error message: TLS handshake error from 10.131.0.29:37428: remote error: tls: unknown certificate authority TLS handshake error from 10.129.0.1:49314: remote error: tls: bad certificate Copy Workaround Manually update the certificate stored in the mutatingwebhookconfiguration object. The correct CA locations might change according to the cluster configuration. However, you can usually find the CA in the secret csr-signer in the namespace openshift-kube-controller-manager. Problem There is no Kubernetes metadata included in the transactions' attributes of your APM agent or in distributed tracing. Solution Verify that the environment variables are being correctly injected by following the instructions described in the Validate your installation step. If they are not present, get the name of the metadata injection pod by running: kubectl get pods | grep newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment kubectl logs -f pod/podname Copy In another terminal, create a new pod (for example, see Validate your installation), and inspect the logs of the metadata injection deployment for errors. For every created pod there should be a set of 4 new entries in the logs like: {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.107Z\",\"caller\":\"server/main.go:139\",\"msg\":\"POST https://newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default.svc:443/mutate?timeout=30s HTTP/2.0\\\" from 10.11.49.2:32836\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.110Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:168\",\"msg\":\"received admission review\",\"kind\":\"/v1, Kind=Pod\",\"namespace\":\"default\",\"name\":\"\",\"pod\":\"busybox1\",\"UID\":\"6577519b-7a61-11ea-965e-0e46d1c9335c\",\"operation\":\"CREATE\",\"userinfo\":{\"username\":\"admin\",\"uid\":\"admin\",\"groups\":[\"system:masters\",\"system:authenticated\"]}} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:182\",\"msg\":\"admission response created\",\"response\":\"[{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env\\\",\\\"value\\\":[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"adn_kops\\\"}]},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"spec.nodeName\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.namespace\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_POD_NAME\\\",\\\"valueFrom\\\":{\\\"fieldRef\\\":{\\\"fieldPath\\\":\\\"metadata.name\\\"}}}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}},{\\\"op\\\":\\\"add\\\",\\\"path\\\":\\\"/spec/containers/0/env/-\\\",\\\"value\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"NEW_RELIC_METADATA_KUBERNETES_CONTAINER_IMAGE_NAME\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"busybox\\\"}}]\"} {\"level\":\"info\",\"ts\":\"2020-04-09T12:55:32.111Z\",\"caller\":\"server/webhook.go:257\",\"msg\":\"writing response\"} Copy If there are no new entries on the logs, it means that the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook service, this could be due to networking rules or security groups rejecting the communication. To check if the apiserver is not being able to communicate with the webhook you should inspect the apiserver logs for errors like: failed calling webhook \"metadata-injection.newrelic.com\": ERROR_REASON Copy To get the apiserver logs: Start a proxy to the Kubernetes API server by the executing the following command in a terminal window and keep it running. kubectl proxy --port=8001 Copy Create a new pod in your cluster, this will make the apiserver try to communicate with the webhook. The following command will create a busybox. kubectl create -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Retrieve the apiserver logs. curl localhost:8001/logs/kube-apiserver.log > apiserver.log Copy Delete the busybox container. kubectl delete -f https://git.io/vPieo Copy Inspect the logs for errors. grep -E 'failed calling webhook' apiserver.log Copy Remember that one of the requirements for the metadata injection is that the apiserver must be allowed egress to the pods running on the cluster. If you encounter errors regarding connection timeouts or failed connections, make sure to check the security groups and firewall rules of the cluster. If there are no log entries in either the apiserver logs or the metadata injection deployment, it means that the webhook was not properly registered. Ensure the metadata injection setup job ran successfully by inspecting the output of: kubectl get job newrelic-metadata-setup Copy If the job is not completed, investigate the logs of the setup job: kubectl logs job/newrelic-metadata-setup Copy Ensure the CertificateSigningRequest is approved and issued by running: kubectl get csr newrelic-metadata-injection-svc.default Copy Ensure the TLS secret is present by running: kubectl get secret newrelic-metadata-injection-secret Copy Ensure the CA bundle is present in the mutating webhook configuration: kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfiguration newrelic-metadata-injection-cfg -o json Copy Ensure the TargetPort of the Service resource matches the Port of the Deployment's container: kubectl describe service/newrelic-metadata-injection-svc kubectl describe deployment/newrelic-metadata-injection-deployment Copy",

      "body": "With New Relic's Kubernetes integration you can monitor both Kubernetes and the services running on it, such as Cassandra, Redis, MySQL, and other supported services. Get started Our Kubernetes integration comes bundled with some of our on-host integrations (like Cassandra, MySQL, and Apache). This lets you get data for those supported services by adding a section to the Kubernetes integration's configuration, which lives as a ConfigMap inside a manifest. What you need Enable this feature for a service Details about how configuration works For an example of how to monitor Redis running on a Kubernetes PHP Guestbook, see this tutorial. What you need To monitor services running on Kubernetes, you only need a Kubernetes cluster running the Kubernetes integration, version 1.13.0 or higher (install | check version | update). We support the following services running on Kubernetes: Apache (does not report inventory data) Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ (does not report inventory data) Redis SNMP Enable monitoring of services To enable our Kubernetes integration to monitor one or more services: Expand this dropdown and get the YAML snippets for the service(s) you want to monitor: Get the config YAML for the integration For the services you want to monitor, follow the links to GitHub to get the YAML snippets you'll need for the next step: Apache Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ Redis SNMP Add the snippet to the Kubernetes integration's ConfigMap, after the data: section: Example configuration This example shows the YAML config for the Apache integration ( highlighted ) added to the Kubernetes integration's config.

Configuration options for each integration Select a service to see available config options: Apache Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ Redis SNMP Verify monitoring is enabled: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure, select Third party services, and then select the service's dashboard. You should see data being reported. Additional notes about enabling services: Enabling multiple services may use more resources than what is set in the resource limits of the Kubernetes integration config file. If this becomes an issue, raise the limit in the resources section. The Kubernetes integration does not automatically update. For best results, regularly update. Monitor services in our Kubernetes integration installed with Helm If you installed our Kubernetes integration using Helm, to monitor services you need to update the existing installation with the new configuration, which contains the services to monitor: helm upgrade --reuse-values -f values.yaml [RELEASE] [CHART] Copy If you use nri-bundle charts, you need to update the children's chart values. Find some examples here. Learn more More resources for learning about configuration: Learn technical details about how configuration works. Learn how to configure monitoring of multiple services with the same config file. See a step-by-step tutorial showing how to monitor a Redis service on Kubernetes. Manually configure service monitoring The enable procedure should be all you need to get monitoring working, but if you run into problems, understanding some technical details about configuration can be helpful. This section goes into more detail about how configuration works. For each service you wish to monitor, you must add a configuration file for that integration to our Kubernetes integration's configuration. This document will cover these subjects: How the service-specific configuration YAML snippet works Adding the service-specific YAML in the Kubernetes integration's config file Adding multiple services to the Kubernetes integration's config file How the service-specific YAML config works Our Kubernetes integration's configuration follows the ConfigMap format. Using a ConfigMap allows us to decouple the configuration for the integrations from the Kubernetes image. The other benefit is that a ConfigMap can be updated automatically without reloading the running container. Because the infrastructure agent uses YAML to configure its associated integrations, ConfigMaps are a good choice for storing YAML. (For more information on config file format, see the Integration config file format.) The Kubernetes integration image comes with an auto-discovery feature that simplifies the configuration of multiple instances of services using a single configuration file. For example, if you have several NGINX instances running, creating an NGINX integration configuration file for every instance would be hard to implement and hard to update. With our auto-discovery option, you can discover and monitor all your NGINX instances with a single configuration file. Each integration has its own specific configuration YAML. Our NGINX integration default config file looks like this: nginx-config.yml: | --- discovery: command: # Use the following optional arguments : # --namespaces: Comma separated list of namespaces to discover pods on # --port: Port used to connect to the kubelet. Default is 10255 # --tls: Use secure (TLS) connection # Custom Example: # exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes --namespaces namespace1,namespace2 --port 10250 --tls # Default exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes match: label.app: nginx integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://${discovery.ip}/status STATUS_MODULE: discover METRICS: 1 Copy The above config enables the following: Runs nri-discovery-kubernetes to query the data for the node we are currently on. Parses the data that comes back and looks for any Kubernetes pod that has a Kubernetes container with an app= label with value nginx. For any matches, it attempts to run the NGINX integration. The status URL is built from: The pod's IP address The status page is pulled from the label on K8s pod called status_url This automatic discovery works the same as the container auto-discovery used by the infrastructure agent. For more advanced options, see Container auto-discovery. Add a service YAML to the Kubernetes integration config It's best practice to configure enabled integrations alongside the Kubernetes integration configuration. This is easier than maintaining configuration files for every single service/integration instance. Below is an example of a Kubernetes integration's ConfigMap. The highlighted section shows where an integration configuration YAML (in this case, NGINX) is placed. For more information on discovery:, see Container auto-discovery for on-host integrations. --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: nginx-config.yml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=nginx\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Use the following optional arguments : # --namespaces: Comma separated list of namespaces to discover pods on # --tls: Use secure (TLS) connection # --port: Port used to connect to the kubelet. Default is 10255 exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes --port PORT --tls match: label.app: nginx integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: # If you're using ngx_http_api_module be certain to use the full path up to and including the version number # Use the discovered IP as the host address STATUS_URL: http://${discovery.ip}/status # Comma separated list of ngx_http_api_module, NON PARAMETERIZED, Endpoints # endpoints: /nginx,/processes,/connections,/ssl,/slabs,/http,/http/requests,/http/server_zones,/http/caches,/http/upstreams,/http/keyvals,/stream,/stream/server_zones,/stream/upstreams,/stream/keyvals,/stream/zone_sync # Name of Nginx status module OHI is to query against. discover | ngx_http_stub_status_module | ngx_http_status_module | ngx_http_api_module STATUS_MODULE: discover METRICS: 1 Copy This configuration map can then be referenced in the DaemonSet, the same as the one that was generated via the command line. Make sure the namespace used is the same one used by the Kubernetes integration manifest. If you haven't changed it in the downloaded manifest file, the value is default. Add multiple services to the same config You can monitor several services using the same Kubernetes integration config file. To do this, add another integration configuration YAML to the same Kubernetes integration config file. Below is the Kubernetes config created in the last section, with a new section for the Cassandra integration's config (highlighted). --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: nginx-config.yml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=nginx\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Run discovery for Kubernetes.

Additionally, depending on your environment, there may be some additional service-specific configuration you must do. When you've completed configuration, our infrastructure agent looks for any pod with a label cassandra and runs the integration against it.",

      "body": "We've written these guidelines to make it easier for you to contribute to our docs, as well as to give you some insight into how we think about good technical writing. We, the Tech Docs team, rely on your expertise to keep New Relic's documentation updated and useful. Thank you for your willingness to share your knowledge! Our style guide focuses on style and usage that's particular to our site. Our site follows American English conventions. For topics that aren't covered, please refer to the Microsoft Writing Style Guide (for guidelines on technical terminology) or the Chicago Manual of Style (for general writing and editing guidelines). Organize your doc to make it easier to read Consider these organization guidelines when thinking about the order of information in a doc. By following these guidelines, you'll make it easier for readers to skim and find what they need. How to organize information Comments Separate what and why from how. Define any necessary prerequisites, policies, or background information (the what and the why) before you step through the how (step-by-step procedures). Examples: Explain what the feature is and why it matters before telling readers how to use it. Describe any limitations with user permissions or subscription levels that would prevent them from using the feature. If the feature is available for any user or subscription level, don't bother to say so. Provide a roadmap for what users will be able to accomplish, so they know before starting a procedure that they have everything they need. Front-load directions with context. Make sure readers know where they need to be, before telling them what to do. In general, use (select an app) to describe what users select from the product index. Examples: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app or service). Select (account dropdown) > User preferences. On the command line, type gitk. Also, structure steps by front-loading context from the user's point of view. For example, instead of \"Go to x to do y,\" structure the step as \"To do y, go to x.\" Separate requirements from options. Example: Type the Email you use to sign in and to receive information from New Relic. Optional: Type additional user emails, separated by commas. Follow the \"five to nine\" guideline. Depending on the topic, organize the information so there is a maximum of five to nine chunks of information. For example, readers may start to get lost or overwhelmed after about five h2 sections or seven steps into a procedure. If you have more than nine h2 sections or steps, you might need to create an additional doc or procedure. Other organization tools to consider: Levels of headings Lists Collapsers Callouts Tables Code examples For more help section Use action-oriented titles Wherever possible, give your document or h2 heading a task- or action-oriented title. Focus on what users are trying to accomplish or the problem they're trying to solve. Use present-tense verbs, rather than \"-ing\" verbs. Quality Title example Bad The query history Okay View query history Good Query history: Create and edit NRQL queries Start the document with an introductory paragraph Unless the document is less than a single screen in length, begin with a brief paragraph that introduces the topic or summarizes the important points. Not sure where to start? Try writing all the content for your document first, and then add the introduction to the top to summarize your key points. Or use the introduction to expand on the text in your metaDescription in the metadata. Keep documents short The amount of content needed can help you decide whether you need one or more documents for the topic. If all of the document's contents apply directly to the title, then everything belongs in the same document. If several related sections could be logically split into individual documents, and the overall length of your document is more than about two screenfuls, split those sections into other documents. Be sure to include links to the related contents. If a large document needs to be broken into multiple smaller documents, consider whether they might be best grouped together in their own sub-category. Use the New Relic voice We strive for a voice that's approachable, expert, and visionary. Check out our voice guidelines for how to write content with these qualities. And keep in mind these essential writing tips that apply to any type of documentation. Guidelines Comments Be clear and direct. Remember to: Use present tense. Use active voice; avoid passive voice. Tell users what to do, not what they \"should\" do. If absolutely necessary, tell users what not to do in situations where unexpected results may occur. Whenever possible, provide an alternative suggestion when telling users what not to do. Example: Using active voice with an alternative suggestion for what not to do Do not use your config file to change this setting, because this could affect other processes. Instead, go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app or service) > Settings > Application. Write to aid localization and translation. Do not use euphemisms, idioms, jargon, or slang. Use the same terms and wording consistently. If you need to include an abbreviation or acronym, spell it out the first time it appears in the document. Always take a moment to ask yourself whether people will really understand the terms you are using in the way you're using them. Change doc titles and anchors Because changes to doc titles, anchors, and redirects can break links to other docs, please create an issue to request these types of changes and we'll help you out with that. Create and edit categories Because changes to categories can affect large groups of docs at once, please create an issue to request these types of changes and we'll help you out with that.

      "body": "When you're creating a new doc, there's a lot to keep track of. You can use this checklist to make sure you've done everything. Title Check that: The doc's title effectively describes the contents. Procedural doc titles use active verbs; for example, Install not Installing. Introduction Check that: The introduction leads with an outcome and provides an overview of how to get there, so customers are confident they've found the right doc. It provides a short, readable overview of the doc's contents. Headings (H2s) Check that: Heading names are concise, yet provide information that helps readers to skim or skip to the section they want. Procedural H2s use active verbs, not the ing verb form. Text Check that the text: Optimizes for easier translation: Avoid idioms, slang, specific cultural references, etc. Tells a good story: Promotes the platform (other New Relic products, alerting, etc.). Includes examples and use cases, identifies personas, explains not only what it is or how to use it but why it matters. Includes hyperlinks in UI paths. Has no typos. Procedures Procedures use active voice and focus on steps (\"do this\"). Avoid burying tips or extra details in the steps. If the procedure includes prerequisites or background information, that information appears before (not buried inside) the ordered list of procedures. If a procedure or step branches, it splits the options so they are clearly visible as bullets, collapsers, etc. If the procedure says what not to do, it also describes what to do instead. Example: What not to do and what to do instead Do not monitor your own applications from the partnership owner account. Instead, create an account within the partnership, and monitor apps from that account. Structure The original tech writer or docs site contributor is the best judge of whether the draft doc is complete. However, in your peer edit, make notes if you have unanswered questions that aren't addressed within the doc or its cross references. Doc structure Comments Complete Check that the overall doc: Is complete, but stays on topic. Includes useful cross references, hyperlinks, and other suggestions to enhance the information, especially for SEO. Skimmable Readers can see at a glance what the doc is about and what to do. It's obvious what parts they can read and what parts they can skip. Visually clean The doc avoids excessive use of callouts, long sentences, or long paragraphs. Useful images For screenshots and images, check that: Full size images always have captions to explain their relevance. UI paths in captions always have hyperlinks. Cropped images clearly show their relevance, with or without captions. In addition, make sure that screenshots and images follow the docs site's security guidelines, and that no private information related to customers or New Relic is displayed. Levels of detail The doc uses H2s, H3s, bullets, tables, and clamshells to organize complex levels of information.",

Find your service (entity) To get started in Explorer, you need to find your service: Go to one.newrelic.com. In the left sidebar, click Services - OpenTelemetry: In the center pane, click the service you want to know more about, or find your service by entering the name in the top filter bar. Narrow down your data with filters Once you have your entity, you can then filter for data from your service. With the filter bar Narrow data to..., you can highlight a specific facet of the telemetry recorded for your service. For example, you may want to see the error rate for a particular version of the service that you've deployed in a canary instance, so you add a filter for service.version='1.2.3'. Filters are preserved when navigating between different views of your data for a service. For example, the filter for service.version='1.2.3' carries over to the Transactions view, so that you would see telemetry on requests to the endpoints (transactions) that are running version 1.2.3 of your service, and not any other versions. Filters are preserved when navigating between the Summary, Transactions, Databases, Externals, Errors, and JVMs views. Filters are also preserved when navigating to the Distributed tracing view, but with limitations. Only filter conditions that use the equals operator (\"=\") are currently supported when navigating to Distributed tracing. If you navigate back from the Distributed tracing page, the filters you selected on the previous view will come back. Once you filter your data, the UI has various views in the left-navigation pane. See our descriptions below for view details. Summary page After you click on a service in the Explorer tab, you see the Summary page listing various golden signals about your entity. Golden signals are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper. For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following: UI area Attribute Response time span.kind = server or consumer Throughput span.kind = server or consumer Error rate span.kind = server or consumer otel.status_code = ERROR Service instances pane service.instance.id (usually set via the OTel resource API) Distributed tracing In Distributed tracing, you can locate traces and examine span details. For your trace data to appear in the New Relic UI, it needs to conform to the OpenTelemetry trace semantic conventions. Also, in the Traces section of our best practices guide, you can find some tips about making sure your traces and spans appear in New Relic. The following attributes are typically not added explicitly to spans. Rather, they are usually set when creating a span or performing operations (for example, recording an error) on a span using the OpenTelemetry SDK. Attribute Description name A span’s name is generally set when starting a span. The name can generally be anything, but the OpenTelemetry specification provides guidance for certain types of spans like Database spans or HTTP spans. span.kind A span’s kind is generally set when starting a span. New Relic uses span.kind to infer that a span is an entry point to a given service. When span.kind = server or consumer it is considered an entry point. When span.kind = client or producer, it is considered a call to an external service or database system. otel.status_code A span’s status is set using the span API. The otel.status_code attribute is how it is manifested by New Relic. The UI primarily uses otel.status_code for the purpose of identifying errors. Find traces and their associated spans Here are some ways to target your searches: To find the traces you want, you can run queries like these in the filter bar: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID When you find an interesting trace, click on it to display a waterfall diagram showing the spans of the trace. Click on specific spans within the trace to display span details in the right panel. Tip For more ways to filter traces, see our distributed tracing UI page. View spans with errors After you click on a span in the trace waterfall view, you can see span errors in the right panel under Error details. The error details are populated by spans containing otel.status_code = ERROR and display the content of otel.status_description. To narrow your search for spans with errors, you can enter otel.status_code = ERROR directly in the distributed tracing filter bar. View span events If you send span events as described by the OpenTelemetry specification, you can view them in the New Relic UI. Span events have two general types: Exceptions Non-exceptions (for example, logs) If you have span events, links for these appear in the right pane: Click on a span in the waterfall view. In the right pane, click View span events, or you can expand Error details and click the link at the bottom of the errors. When you're in span events and only want to view exceptions, slide the toggle Only show exceptions. Tip OpenTelemetry exceptions handled by the app/service are displayed independently of span error status and are not necessarily associated with a span error status. Databases The Databases page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts. For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following: UI area Attribute Top database calls span.kind = client or producer db.system Facets by span name Top databases (by query time) span.kind = client or producer db.system Facets by db.system Top databases (by throughput) span.kind = client or producer db.system Facets by db.system Errors On the Errors page, you can see total errors as well as charts showing error count and error rate. For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following: span.kind = server or consumer otel.status_code = ERROR Facets by span name Externals Externals capture calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and other network entities. For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following: span.kind = client or producer db.system is not present JVMs When you drill into a specific JVM, the UI display charts driven by JVM metric data: JVM metrics follow the general semantic conventions for runtime environment metrics. The Java specific runtime metrics are not well documented. The implementation is effectively the documentation and may be subject to change. For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following: Requires a unique service.instance.id attribute for rendering the list of JVMs Service.instance.id is an OpenTelemetry resource attribute Logs The Logs page displays logs from your application. For more information about how to associate log data to your application in New Relic, see our OpenTelemetry and logging documentation. For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following: service.name To correlate with trace data, the logs should contain the trace.id and span.id attributes. Metrics explorer For selected OpenTelemetry languages, you can see information about your metrics in this section. Also, if you are using the Prometheus exporter with OpenTelemetry, you can view your metric data here. Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in your application's response time. To get a list of transactions: From the Transaction Summary page, select the transactions table. For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following: UI area Description Top Transactions span.kind = server or consumer Facets by span name Throughput span.kind = server or consumer Facets by span name Data explorer and query builder Explore your metrics and traces using the data explorer, or write your own queries in query builder using NRQL.

It's free, forever. If you're just getting acquainted with OpenTelemetry, this is what we'll explore here: Benefits of OpenTelemetry Should I use OpenTelemetry or New Relic agents? How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Benefits of OpenTelemetry OpenTelemetry provides a secure, vendor-neutral specification for service instrumentation so that you can export data to distinct backends of your choice, such as New Relic. OpenTelemetry offers a single set of APIs and libraries that standardize how you collect and transfer telemetry data for your services. The following components make up the OpenTelemetry project: Specifications for the core pillars of observability to drive consistency across all projects. New Relic supports all of these signals: traces, metrics, and logs (see details below) APIs that contain interfaces and implementations based on the specifications SDKs (reference implementations of the APIs) created specifically for languages like Java, Python, Go, Erlang, and more Collectors that offer a vendor-agnostic implementation for processing and exporting Exporters that enable you to send data to a backend of your choice The components of OpenTelemetry work together to create some distinct advantages for capturing telemetry data: Feature Description Ubiquitous instrumentation A single, open standard of instrumentation provides better coverage and flexibility as engineers from all over the world contribute to the instrumentation. Future proof As the instrumentation gets built into libraries and frameworks, and as more vendors move to support this open standard, you can be confident that you won’t need to change your instrumentation. Support for newer technologies When new technologies emerge, contributors can build integrations into OpenTelemetry or add instrumentation directly to source code, ensuring end users can easily monitor these new technologies. Simplified choice You don’t need to decide which instrumentation option to use (a proprietary option or one of the other open standards). Cross-platform compatibility OpenTelemetry supports a variety of languages and backends. It represents a vendor-neutral path for capturing and transmitting telemetry to backends without altering existing instrumentation. Streamlined observability It is easier for vendors to support and test against a single standard as they don’t need to develop their own agents or collectors. High dimensionality OpenTelemetry uses dimensional metrics, so you can filter and facet on more aspects of the data, such as AWS regions, Kubernetes clusters, or service versions. Dimensional metrics also lead to less time between occurrence and reporting. Efficiency OpenTelemetry’s fire-and-forget trace-centric approach to instrumentation often has lower overhead than New Relic agents, especially for asynchronous workloads. It will also result in better handling of trace data for asynchronous requests. Should I use OpenTelemetry instrumentation or New Relic agents? As you consider OpenTelemetry, you may also be looking at New Relic APM agents that also capture telemetry data. As you'd expect, there is a lot of overlap between features available from OpenTelemetry agents and SDKs versus those available from New Relic APM agents. This is especially true if you're interested in distributed tracing telemetry data. The choice you make depends on what you need. We recommend that you explore both New Relic and OpenTelemetry instrumentation or discuss this with us in our CNCF Slack channel to decide what works best for you. OpenTelemetry: A work in progress OpenTelemetry is still an emerging standard, so your choices may be affected by what's available. You can check on the current state of the specification at the OpenTelemetry site. The current state of language-specific OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs varies: some languages are still pre-alpha and may be missing instructions on how to instrument your service. Most languages have some implementation of traces that is sufficient to start exporting data to New Relic. Check out this table in GitHub that provides an overview of the state of OpenTelemetry specification compliance for each language. For languages that New Relic does not currently provide an agent or SDK, OpenTelemetry may offer you a good alternative. Also, in cases where you want explicit control over sampling of your telemetry data, OpenTelemetry provides a lot of flexibility. As OpenTelemetry matures, New Relic will continue to support new OpenTelemetry data models and to provide a curated UI experience for our Full Stack Observability customers. New Relic's APM agents In general, New Relic's APM agents will collect more telemetry data for your services, and they offer a wide range of configuration options and an extensive set of auto-instrumentation capabilities. New Relic's APM agents offer detailed transaction trace visibility for individual services. They also offer predefined sampling to balance the performance impact of your instrumentation against the need to capture enough data to gain helpful insights. How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic New Relic supports the native OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) for exporting telemetry data. This allows you to use the vendor neutral components developed by the OpenTelemetry community to export your data to New Relic. The following tables show the supported features for each telemetry signal. If you have questions about these or have an unsupported use case, please contact us in our CNCF Slack channel, and watch this page for future updates. Important New Relic's exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of exporting data to New Relic using OTLP. Traces New Relic offers support for the OTLP ingest of trace signals. The maturity of the upstream specification is stable. OpenTelemetry traces and spans are compatible with New Relic traces and spans. OpenTelemetry spans optionally include attributes (name-value pairs) and resource attributes which map directly to dimensions that can be used to facet or filter span data at query time. OpenTelemetry span metadata (for example, name, kind, and trace_id) also map directly to dimensions on NewRelic spans. At this time, New Relic does not support span links or array attributes. For details, see the Traces section of our best practices guide. Feature Supported Span events ✅ Span linking ❌ Array of primitives (homogeneous) ❌ Metrics New Relic offers support for the OTLP ingest of metric signals. Note that the maturity of the upstream specification is experimental. We intend to follow potentially breaking upstream changes. Here are the OpenTelemetry data types we support and their associated mappings. For details, see the Metrics section of our best practices guide. Metric Type Supported Delta sums ✅ Cumulative sums ✅ Gauges ✅ Delta histograms ✅ Summary ✅ Cumulative histograms ❌ Exemplars ❌ Array of primitives (homogeneous) ❌ Logs New Relic offers support for the OTLP ingest of log signals.

OpenTelemetry logs optionally include attributes (name-value pairs) and resource attributes which map directly to dimensions that can be used to facet or filter log data at query time. OpenTelemetry log metadata (for example, name, severity_text, and trace_id) also map directly to dimensions on New Relic logs. NewRelic currently supports all OpenTelemetry log message types except for arrays. For more details, see the Logs section of our best practices guide. Feature Supported Description LogRecord body ✅ Supported types: string, boolean, int, double, bytes LogRecord attributes ✅ Supported types: string, boolean, int, double, bytes LogRecord fields ✅ Examples: name, severity_text, trace_id Array messages ❌ Array attributes ❌ Next steps Follow the OpenTelemetry quick start to help you get started.

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. This document explains the older, legacy configuration format. Important New Relic recommends using the new standard improved configuration format. To update your configuration file to this new format, check the update section For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration file structure An on-host integration that uses the standard configuration format requires two configuration files: A definition file A configuration file Definition file The definition file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml. This file provides descriptive information about the integration, such as: the version of the JSON protocol it supports, a list of commands it can execute, and arguments that it accepts. It lives in this directory: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations Copy Here's an example of an NGINX integration definition file with two command sections on a Linux system: name: com.myorg.nginx protocol_version: 2 description: Collect metric and configuration data from NGINX os: linux commands: metrics: command: - myorg-nginx - --metrics interval: 15 inventory: command: - myorg-nginx - --inventory interval: 120 prefix: integration/myorg-nginx Copy A definition file can be broken down into two parts: The header The commands section Definition file header Here are explanations of a definition file's header elements: Definition header field Description name Required. A unique name name to identify the integration for logging, internal metrics, etc. When the agent loads the config file, New Relic uses the name to look up the integration in the agent's registry. protocol_version Required. The version number of the protocol. New Relic uses this to ensure compatibility between the integration and the agent. If the agent does not recognize an integration's version, it will filter out that integration and create a log message. The current version of the JSON protocol is 2. For more on protocol changes, see SDK changes. description Optional. Human-friendly explanation of what the integration does. os Optional. The operating system where the integration runs. New Relic uses this to filter integrations that you intend to run only on specific operating systems. Default: Run the integration regardless of the os value. To restrict the integration to a specific operating system, use either of these options: linux windows Definition file commands After the header is a list of commands. The commands section defines: One or more independent operating modes for the executable The runtime data required for it to be executed The commands section is a YAML map of command definitions, where each key is the unique alias name of the command in the integration's config file that specifies the executable to run. Definition commands Description command Required. The actual command line to be executed as a YAML array of command parts. These are assembled to run the actual command. For simple commands, the array might be only a single element. Additional command rules include: command arguments: The command and any command line arguments that are shared for all instances of the integration configuration. command execution: The command will be executed in the same directory as the definition file. command path: Any commands available on the host's $PATH can be used. Executables located in the same directory as the definition file, or in a subdirectory of it, can be executed using a relative path. For example: Linux: To run an executable called myorg-nginx in the same directory as the definition file, you could use myorg-nginx or ./myorg-nginx. Linux systems will execute myorg-nginx as if the user used ./myorg-nginx. Windows: To run an executable called myorg-nginx.exe in the same directory as the definition file, you could use \\myorg-nginx.exe or .\\myorg-nginx.exe. Windows systems writing myorg-nginx.exe will be executed as if indicating the current path: .\\myorg-nginx.exe. To use a command installed inside a directory on the host's $PATH, simply use the command name. Example: python. To run any other executable which is neither on the host's $PATH nor within the integration's directory, use an absolute path to the executable. Example: /opt/jdk/bin/java. If the given executable name exists within the integration's directory but also exists elsewhere on the system $PATH, the version in the integration's directory takes precedence. interval Optional. The number of seconds between two consecutive executions of the command, in particular between the end of the previous execution and the start of the next execution. Default for metric polling: 30 seconds. Minimum (floor): 15 seconds. Alerts: For metrics being used for alerts, use an interval of 30 seconds or less. prefix Optional. The categorization of the inventory in the form of category/short_integration_name. Example: integration/myorg-nginx. The prefix is not a platform-specific path. The forward slash is the correct separator between the category and short_integration_name. The prefix can have a maximum of two levels. Otherwise inventory will not be reported. Default value if not set: integration/integration_name. Configuration file The configuration file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml. This file specifies which executables to run and the parameters required to run them. It lives in this directory: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d Copy Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Here's an example of a config file with one instance defined. Explanations of these fields are explained below the example. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Another example of a config file with two instances defined. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://one.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer - name: nginx2.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://another.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Config file field definitions Config file field Description integration_name Required. This is the header and is used to identify which executables to run. This name must exactly match the name specified in the integration's definition file. Recommendation: To ensure unique names, use reverse domain name notation. name Required. This is the name for the specific invocation (instance) of the integration. This is used to help identify any log messages generated by this integration and is also useful for troubleshooting. command Required. This is the command to be executed. This must exactly match one of the unique alias names specified in the integration's definition file. arguments Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The argument name. Transformed to upper case when set as environment variable. Values: The argument values. Passed through as is. The arguments are made available to an integration as a set of environment variables. Arguments in the config file cannot be capitalised and should use underscores to separate words. labels Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The label name. Values: The defined label value. integration_user Optional. String with the name the agent will use for executing the integration binary. Default: depends on the usermode. By default, integrations are executed with the same user that's running the integration agent, nri-agent for privileged and unprivileged mode and root user for root mode. When present, the Infrastructure agent will execute the integration binary as the specified user. For example, to run the integration binary as the root user when running the agent in a usermode different than root, just add integration_user: root to the configuration file.",

FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full user count. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full users This query shows the billable full users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should set the Evaluation offset value to 60 minutes or your conditions may not trigger. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events. Attribute Description productLine The category of usage. There are four options: DataPlatform, FullStackObservability, IncidentIntelligence, or ProactiveDetection. For more details about these categories, see New Relic platform. metric Consolidates multiple categories of usage into a single metric. Helpful when faceting by productLine. consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. estimatedCost Calculates a cost estimate based on usage and metric cost. This is an estimate of costs to date, not your monthly invoice. For more attributes, see the data dictionary.",

      "body": "An explanation of how New Relic One pricing works, and how to view and manage billing. Important This document explains the New Relic One pricing plan. If you’re on our original pricing plan, see Original pricing. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing. How the New Relic One pricing plan works Starting July 30, 2020, all of our new customers are on a pricing plan that we call New Relic One pricing. Customers on our original pricing plan are able to transition to this pricing. For New Relic One pricing, billing is based on these factors: The amount of data ingested. 100 GBs per month is free. $0.25 per GB ingested above that. The number of provisioned full users, defined as users with access to Full Stack Observability features. Basic users are free. The cost of each full user depends on your edition: Standard, Pro, or Enterprise. Standard edition includes one full user for free, and a max of five. Pro and Enterprise give access to more account and user management features, more support, longer data retention, and other features. For Applied Intelligence, our intelligent alert/detection system: the number of incident events above the free 1000 per month. (Note that our alerting functionality is available for free and doesn't count towards this limit.) For a summary of what's included for free, see Free edition. For an overview of pricing, see our Pricing page. Keep reading for details about New Relic One pricing and billing. Billing and usage in the UI For how to view and manage billing and usage in the UI, see Pricing and billing UI. If you need more detail than the usage UI shows, you can also run queries of your usage data and set up alerts. Billing calculation details For accounts on New Relic One pricing, some high-level billing information is displayed in the UI. Here are some more details about how billing works: Data usage calculation One pricing factor is your ingested data. In this context, “ingested” refers to the data actually saved to your account after we apply various data trimming and data transformation rules. In other words, it’s not the size of the raw data sent to New Relic, but the size of the data that actually ends up stored. To view and manage your usage, go to the usage UI. Other calculation details: In the context of our pricing plan, a GB is defined as 1 billion bytes. Monthly data ingested is rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if your account uses 100.9 GBs during a month, that’s counted as 100 GBs. For more on how data is ingested, see Manage data ingest. For how to query usage, see Query and alert on usage. Incident Intelligence events One billing factor is how many incident events your organization sends to Incident Intelligence for correlation and analysis. If your organization is on New Relic One pricing, Incident Intelligence comes with a certain number of free incident events per month. (Our original pricing plan doesn't have a free tier.) You can track usage and cost in two places in the UI: In the usage UI From the Incident Intelligence system settings UI page: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, then click Incident Intelligence, and then click System settings. Determine event source When you set up Incident Intelligence data sources, the incident events ingested by those sources are what count towards your total. To see the sources affecting your billing, go to the Sources page: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, click Incident Intelligence, and then click Sources. Stop reporting events Go to the Incident Intelligence Sources UI page and disconnect all the sources you don’t want. If all sources are removed, no data is sent to Incident Intelligence. Full user count billing details For accounts with New Relic One pricing, the monthly count of provisioned full users is one billing factor. To give an example: if you're on the Pro pricing edition and your organization has 100 full users during the month of January, you'd be billed for 100 full users for that month. A full user counts as a billable user the moment they're added to a New Relic organization (provisioned), whether or not that user has logged into or used New Relic yet. A user's user type is meant to be long-term setting determined by a user's expected New Relic duties and responsibilities. Because user type is a billing factor, we have restrictions around how often a full user can be downgraded to a basic user: a full user can downgrade to a basic user a maximum of two times in a rolling 12-month period. If a full user has been changed to a basic user two times in that 12-month period, that user won't be able to return to being a basic user until the start of the next 12-month period. To learn reasons for assigning one user type or another, see Tips on assigning user type. Here are more user-related billing details and caveats: You can see your full user count in the UI. We de-duplicate users based on email address. If there are multiple users in an organization that have the same email address, those user records count as a single user for billing purposes. The count of full users is prorated based on the start of a New Relic subscription, or based on when a user is created as a full user or converted to a full user. A New Relic user can have a maximum of either three concurrent active sessions, or three unique IP addresses in use at any given time. For organizations on our original user model that have a parent/child account structure, the count of billable users in the UI may differ from the users you can see. For more on this, see User count discrepancy. The Standard edition of the New Relic One pricing plan includes one free full user. For organizations on our original user model, because the organization-related settings aren't as robust as on our newer model, a user may be set as a basic user in one account and as a full user in another account. In such cases, the full user status takes precedence and that user is considered a full user. For how to query usage data, see Query and alert on usage. For more on user capabilities, see Users and roles. Data retention See Data retention. Billing periods For pay-as-you-go customers, billing occurs at the end of the month (UTC), and you can see this tracked in the UI. When you input your credit card and start to be charged, your end-of-month bill will take into account all activity (billable data usage and users) that occurred since the beginning of that month. For example: if you input your credit card in the middle of the month, and so far at that point your account has 200 GBs of usage for that month, that 200 GBs counts towards your end-of-month bill. For how to query user-related usage, see Query and alert on usage. Usage plan details There are two New Relic One pricing usage plans: Pay-as-you-go: This plan bills at the end of each month. There are no commitments and you can cancel at any time. For details, see Usage plans. Annual pool of funds: This plan applies to some customers who have subscribed for a year or more. For details, see Usage plans. For some frequently asked questions, see Pricing FAQs. Query and alert on usage data To create detailed queries of your usage, and get notifications when you are close to hitting certain usage levels, see Query usage data. Free tier If your organization is on New Relic One pricing and on the Standard pricing edition for Full Stack Observability, you can use New Relic free, forever, if you stay under the free allowed limits. Here's a summary of what Standard edition gets access to for free: A single account (Pro and Enterprise Full Stack Observability editions can have multiple accounts per organization). Up to 100 GBs of ingested data per month. One full user, and unlimited basic users. Access to alerts and Applied Intelligence (up to 1,000 Incident Intelligence events per month). To upgrade to Pro or Enterprise, or to learn more about pricing, see New Relic pricing. Non-profit use of New Relic If you’re a non-profit and want to use New Relic at special pricing, see our Non-profit eligibility docs. Cancel or downgrade See Downgrade account.",

      "body": "When you're creating a new doc, there's a lot to keep track of. You can use this checklist to make sure you've done everything. Title Check that: The doc's title effectively describes the contents. Procedural doc titles use active verbs; for example, Install not Installing. Introduction Check that: The introduction leads with an outcome and provides an overview of how to get there, so customers are confident they've found the right doc. It provides a short, readable overview of the doc's contents. Headings (H2s) Check that: Heading names are concise, yet provide information that helps readers to skim or skip to the section they want. Procedural H2s use active verbs, not the ing verb form. Text Check that the text: Optimizes for easier translation: Avoid idioms, slang, specific cultural references, etc. Tells a good story: Promotes the platform (other New Relic products, alerting, etc.). Includes examples and use cases, identifies personas, explains not only what it is or how to use it but why it matters. Includes hyperlinks in UI paths. Has no typos. Procedures Procedures use active voice and focus on steps (\"do this\"). Avoid burying tips or extra details in the steps. If the procedure includes prerequisites or background information, that information appears before (not buried inside) the ordered list of procedures. If a procedure or step branches, it splits the options so they are clearly visible as bullets, collapsers, etc. If the procedure says what not to do, it also describes what to do instead. Example: What not to do and what to do instead Do not monitor your own applications from the partnership owner account. Instead, create an account within the partnership, and monitor apps from that account. Structure The original tech writer or docs site contributor is the best judge of whether the draft doc is complete. However, in your peer edit, make notes if you have unanswered questions that aren't addressed within the doc or its cross references. Doc structure Comments Complete Check that the overall doc: Is complete, but stays on topic. Includes useful cross references, hyperlinks, and other suggestions to enhance the information, especially for SEO. Skimmable Readers can see at a glance what the doc is about and what to do. It's obvious what parts they can read and what parts they can skip. Visually clean The doc avoids excessive use of callouts, long sentences, or long paragraphs. Useful images For screenshots and images, check that: Full size images always have captions to explain their relevance. UI paths in captions always have hyperlinks. Cropped images clearly show their relevance, with or without captions. In addition, make sure that screenshots and images follow the docs site's security guidelines, and that no private information related to customers or New Relic is displayed. Levels of detail The doc uses H2s, H3s, bullets, tables, and clamshells to organize complex levels of information.",

Update your CLI Before you run any commands, ensure that you have the latest version of the CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Check your permissions To publish your Nerdpack and update its catalog information, you need: Access to the account that published it The necessary permissions for managing Nerdpacks Publish your Nerdpack You need to publish Nerdpacks that you create before you can update their catalog information. Update your Nerdpack's catalog metadata After you've published your Nerdpack to the New Relic One catalog, update the Nerdpack's metadata to let users know all about your Nerdlets or visualizations. Step 1 of 9 Go to New Relic: Step 2 of 9 Navigate to Apps: Step 3 of 9 Find your published Nerdpack under New Relic One catalog: Notice that there is no information on the Apps or details page other than the Nerdpack's name and the brief description found in nr1.json: There are no screenshots, icons, details, or what's new features. For these, you need to provide catalog information to your Nerdpack. Step 4 of 9 From the root of your Nerdpack, create catalog directories to house your Nerdpack's screenshots and metadata: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type catalog ✔ created: launchers/launcher/catalog ✔ created: nerdlets/home/catalog ✔ catalog created successfully! catalog is available at \"./catalog\" Inside your root catalog directory, you'll find specific files and directories for portraying information about your Nerdpack to your users: bash Copy $ ls catalog README.md additionalInfo.md config.json documentation.md screenshots File Description README.md A markdown file that instructs you how to use the information and metadata in catalog config.json A JSON file that contains the following fields: tagline: A brief headline for the application.

      "body": "For users on our original user model, an introduction to how the user model works, including user roles and permissions, and how to add and manage users. Requirements This doc and the surrounding section of docs shows you how to manage users on our original user model. If you were a New Relic customer before July 30 2020 and haven't migrated your users to the new model, your users are on our original user model (and not the New Relic One model). If you're an admin and want to see if you have users on the original model: If you can see users in the Users and roles UI, those users are on our original user model. Updates about our new user model In July of 2020, we released a new user model called the New Relic One user model, which offers many benefits in terms of how you manage your organization and users. At first this was only available to new sign-ups but over time we've been migrating more older customers to the new model. Some older customers are able to migrate their users on their own. We'll continue working on migrating users to the new model until the original model is fully deprecated. One impact of the new user model is that it's possible now for users to have multiple logins associated with the same email. For example, a user with access to multiple organizations (like a contractor) may have their user record updated to the new user model in one organization, resulting in them having their original login method and records and a New Relic One user model record. This may result in the user being logged in to New Relic and not being able to find an account they're looking for. For more on that, see Factors affecting access. If a user's email is associated with more than one login, they'll see a \"multiple accounts found\" note when logging in. View and manage users in UI If your New Relic account has users on our original user model, you can use the Users and roles UI. To access this: Click the account dropdown, click Account settings, and then click Users and roles. Some features in the UI are visible only to account Owners and Admins. Tip You can also use the New Relic REST API to obtain a list of everyone and their roles in your New Relic account. Here are some instructions and tips for adding and managing users via the UI: Add a new user Tip Owner or Admins To add a new user to your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. In the upper right corner, click New user. Enter the appropriate name and email address. Select their base role as either Admin, User, or Restricted. Select Add user. The new user will receive an email notification automatically from New Relic. Important New Relic recommends a maximum of 1,000 accounts per user. Additional accounts may result in limited access to some New Relic features. Manage user type (basic vs full) and full user upgrades Note that billing-related aspects of your count of full users only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. To update a user's type (basic user versus full user): Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Either select a user and edit their type or bulk update the type for multiple useres. To control how basic users upgrade to become full users, from the Users and roles UI you can select Access requests. You have two options: Automatic approval: With this option, basic users can automatically upgrade to be full users. This option allows your users to more easily troubleshoot problems. Require review: With this option, your admins get a notification when basic users request an upgrade and must upgrade them first. You can approve them either from the notification email or from the user's entry in the Users and roles UI. For more about user type, see User type. Determine full user count If you're on New Relic One pricing plan, your count of full users is a factor in your billing. To see your count of full users, click the account dropdown and then click View your usage. If you have a parent/child account structure (including a customer partnership), your count of full users may not match what you see when you go to Account settings > Users and roles. To examine users on a parent account's children accounts, go to a parent account's Account settings UI page, click on a child account, and go to that account's Users and roles UI page. Enable SAML SSO and/or SCIM For an introduction to using SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning, see Get started with SAML SSO or SCIM. View pending SAML SSO users New Relic accounts with SAML Single Sign On (SSO) may have a list of Pending users. These are individuals who have been added to the SAML-enabled account but have not yet confirmed. Update account roles Tip Owner or Admins To update a person's role and capabilities: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Select the person's name. Under Roles and capabilities, select their base role as Admin, User, or Restricted. The account Owner must update the Owner role. Delete a user Tip Owner or Admins To remove a user from your New Relic account: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. Click on the name of the person you would like to update. Click Delete User. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk via CSV file. Update the account Owner A New Relic account can have only one Owner role at any time. You must be the current account Owner to change your role to someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. If the current Owner is unavailable, contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. You cannot delete or remove your assigned Owner role. However, if the account has one or more Admin role, you can change an Owner to an Admin. Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. Above the Active users list, select Change owner. If an account has no Admins, this button won't be available. Select someone who currently has an Admin role for the account. Refresh the page for changes to take effect. Your previous Owner role automatically changes to an Admin role. To find out who is the current assigned Owner: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Account > Users and roles. View the Base role column to locate your account Owner. The Change owner button is only visible to the current account Owner. If the current Owner is unable to change the role (for example, that person no longer is with your organization), contact your account representative at New Relic, or get support at support.newrelic.com. User types: basic user and full user Important This section is for users on our original user model. If you're on our New Relic One user model, see our New Relic One user docs. Starting March 2021, we ended the preview period for basic users on our original user model. The preview period gave these basic users the same permissions as full users. For more on this, see our Explorers Hub post on user type changes. The user type (basic user or full user) determines what features a user has access to. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. If you're on our original pricing plan, billing impacts do not apply. Basic user. Details: These users have access to basic features like setting up reporting of data, running queries of data, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. They do not have access to Full-Stack Observability features (for more details on feature access, see Capabilities). Depending on access request settings, basic users can either upgrade themselves to be full users or request upgrade access from admins. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include our curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, and synthetic monitors. For details on what's available, see Capabilities. For organizations on New Relic One pricing: these users are billable. The Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total. If a user in your organization is set as a basic user in one account and a full user in another, the user is considered a full user and has full user access on all accounts in that organization. For how to edit a user's type, see Manage users. Account roles A New Relic account can have only one Owner. To share an account with other users in your organization, create Admins, Users, or Restricted Users. Account role Description Owner The person who initially creates the New Relic account and receives all billing queries. The Owner has complete access to all of the account information. Admin Can add, edit, and delete users, and can enable or set up features. User Can use (and optionally set up) New Relic features. In general, Admins take responsibility for setting up features, and Users and Restricted Users can use them. Restricted User One or more individuals who can view (but not set up or change) any New Relic features. The Restricted User role is useful, for example, for demos. You can change your New Relic session settings so that Restricted User logins do not time out, and then set the user interface to Kiosk mode. Add-on roles With add-on roles, you can grant variable levels of access to all users in your account, across the entire platform of New Relic products. This allows you to tailor your account permissions levels to suit the needs of Users and Restricted Users within your account. Giving a User or Restricted User add-on manager access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. They will continue to have User or Restricted User capabilities for all other New Relic products. For example, you could make a software engineer in your company a User in most products, but assign Admin-level access to APM. For another example, you might assign the Nerdpack manager role to a user, and that gives them the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe New Relic One applications to an account. There are two types of add-on roles: Add-on Manager roles are available to grant permissions on a per-product basis. Giving a User or Restricted User managed add-on access to a product grants them the equivalent of Admin capabilities within the product. Custom add-on roles can grant feature-specific permissions across different New Relic products. For example, a group of Users could have the ability to acknowledge incidents and close violations in New Relic Alerts, but not have the ability to modify your existing alert preferences. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of the parent account. Below are options for managing both managed add-on roles and custom add-on roles: View roles To view the list of individuals assigned to your account and their current roles: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. Assign a managed role Tip Owner and Admins Managed add-on roles are available by default for each New Relic product. Adding a managed role for a user grants them Admin-level permissions for the assigned product. They cannot be edited or deleted. To assign a managed add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name. Under Add-on roles, select the type of manager role for the user. To understand which capabilities may be added, use the Capabilities preview chart. Features in the Capabilities preview chart may not exactly match what features are available for your subscription level. Tip You can also add, update, or delete users in bulk by using a CSV file. Create a custom role To create a custom add-on role for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. Select New custom add-on role. Select the capabilities necessary for the new custom role, then Create role. Assign a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You must create a custom role before assigning it to a user. To assign a custom add-on role for a User or Restricted User in your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Users. From the list of users associated with your account, select their name ]. Under Add-on roles, select a custom role for the user. Click Update user. Edit or delete a custom role Tip Owners and Admins You cannot edit or delete New Relic's default roles. However, you can edit or delete custom add-on roles for your account: Go to account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles > Roles. From the Add-on roles list, select the custom add-on role, then select Edit role or Delete role as appropriate. Account permissions Here is a summary of user permissions. Individuals on a parent account automatically have the same level of access for all the child accounts of that parent account. However, they won't receive email notifications for alerts or weekly reports for child accounts unless they are explicitly granted permission on those accounts. Function Owner Admin User Restricted Maintain billing information. Change the account Owner. Add, update, and delete account Admins, Users, and Restricted Users. When the account Owner and Admins add individuals to the account, New Relic automatically sends them an email message. Update users' job titles and roles from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Create, modify and delete child accounts from Account settings in the New Relic UI. Update your own account information (name, password change or password reset request, default account, email preferences, etc.) from User preferences in the New Relic UI. Change someone else's password. You cannot reset passwords for anyone else on the account, even if you are an Owner or Admin. Instead, follow standard procedures to request a password reset from New Relic. View the list of individuals on the account from (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary in the New Relic UI. Manage flexible data retention. Subscribe and unsubscribe applications to New Relic One Add, update, and delete Proactive Detection configurations. Alert permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Alerts. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Alerts, assign an Alerts add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Alerts include: Create or name alert policies. Specify incident preferences. Disable or define alert conditions. Provide runbook instructions. Select product targets. Alter alert condition thresholds. Create, modify, or delete notification channels. APM permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with APM. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in APM, assign an APM add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for APM include: Remove applications from the New Relic UI. Delete app traces and error traces. Browser permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Browser. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Browser, assign a Browser add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Browser include: Add, rename, or delete applications. Manage whitelists. Manage domain conditions. Infrastructure permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Infrastructure. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Infrastructure, assign an Infrastructure manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Infrastructure include: Create alert conditions in New Relic Infrastructure, including conditions for host not reporting. Add or modify integrations. Insights permissions Here is a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Insights. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions, assign an Insights manager role. These functions include: Create, view, modify, or delete Query API keys or Insert API keys. Tip New Relic Insights includes permission levels to share your Insights dashboards with others. Mobile permissions To give permission to delete a mobile app from New Relic, you can assign an Admin or Mobile manager role. Synthetics permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic Synthetics. To allow a User or Restricted User to execute any of these functions in New Relic Synthetics, assign a Synthetics add-on manager role. Admin and manager capabilities for Synthetics include: Create, edit, or delete monitors. Edit monitor scripts. Create, edit, or delete private locations. Create, edit, or delete monitor downtimes. Create, view, edit, or delete secure credentials. For more information, see User roles in Synthetics. Workloads permissions Here's a summary of Admin and Add-on manager capabilities with New Relic One workloads: Create, duplicate, modify, or delete workloads.

      "body": "Important This doc explains how to manage users on our original user model. Not sure which model you're on? See Overview of user models. With the Bulk user actions feature, you can add, update, or delete multiple users at once. This can be helpful for: adding roles when multiple new employees start deleting roles when multiple employees leave giving multiple employees Admin roles Update users in bulk Some important rules and recommendations for making bulk user actions: You cannot make updates to your own role or an Owner role. You cannot edit an existing user's email address or name. You should avoid editing an existing user by deleting and re-adding them because this can have unintended consequences (for example, API keys associated with the original user will be lost). To add new user roles, update existing user roles, or delete user roles for users on the original user model: Go to: account dropdown > Account settings > Users and roles, and add /bulk_actions at the end of the URL. Example URL: https://account.newrelic.com/accounts/123456789/users/bulk_actions Copy Download a Backup CSV file. Downloading a backup file keeps a record of the users in your account prior to changes being made, and allows you to easily re-add any users that may be removed accidentally. Download a CSV of users or a CSV template. Each bulk action (add, update, or delete) will require its own CSV file. New Relic recommends saving your files with an account number, date, and the bulk action being performed. For example: account_123456789_delete_users_2018-06-29 Populate that sheet with only the users whose roles you'll be applying the chosen bulk action for. Remove users from the spreadsheet whose roles you do not want to change. Bulk action Fields Add Required fields: user email, name, type, base role Optional field: add-on role Update Required fields: user email (do not edit), name (do not edit), base role Optional field: add-on role Delete Required fields: only user email Example CSV file The following is an example downloaded CSV of users that lists four users on the New Relic account. In this example, we want to delete the user Alex Datanerd. All other users must be removed before uploading the CSV. Email Name Type Base role Add-on roles Last active User1 @Company.com Jane Datanerd full Owner 2/6/20 User2 @Company.com Jamie Datanerd full Admin 6/6/20 User3 @Company.com Alex Datanerd full User apm_admin, browser_admin 7/25/20 User4 @Company.com Pat Datanerd basic User alerts_admin, insights_admin, apm_admin 4/6/20 The other three users, whose roles will remain unchanged, are removed. The final CSV only shows Alex's name. This file would then be uploaded using the Delete users in CSV option in the UI. Email Name Type Base role Add-on roles Last active User3 @Company.com Alex Datanerd full User apm_admin, browser_admin In the UI, select a CSV action: Add, Update, or Delete the users listed within the CSV file. Upload the new CSV, and select Save changes. Troubleshooting If a user is removed or changed during your CSV file upload by mistake, you can add them back through another CSV file upload. Important Be aware that associated permissions may be lost when a user is deleted and re-added. For example, associated API keys will need to be re-added. If you have a backup CSV file If you have a backup CSV file saved: Open the backup CSV file. Populate the backup CSV file with the users whose roles will be modified. Select a CSV action for the new CSV file: add, update, or delete Upload the new CSV, and select Save changes. If no backup file exists If no backup CSV file has been previously downloaded: Download the CSV file template. Populate the spreadsheet with the information required for the user to be restored. Action Required fields Add User email, name, type, base role. Optional: Add-on role Update User email, name, type, base role. Optional: Add-on role Delete User email Select a CSV action for the new CSV file: Add, Update, or Delete. Upload the new CSV, and select Save changes.",

      "body": "Your New Relic users can be on one of two user models: this doc explains the New Relic One user model. Important If your New Relic organization was created before July 30 2020 and you haven't gone through a user migration process, your users are likely on our original user model. For more on this, see User model changes. Overview This doc will explain the structure of the New Relic One user model, including: User type (basic user versus full user) Default user groups, including Admin and User Roles and capabilities For how to add and manage users in the UI, see User management. User type: basic and full Important This section is for users on our New Relic One user model. If you're on our original user model, see Original users. The user type (basic user or full user) determines whether a user has access to our Full Stack Observability features. A user's type is something you set long-term based on that user's expected New Relic responsibilities. Below are details on the two user types. Note that billing-related aspects only apply if you're on New Relic One pricing. Basic user. Details: These users are free and have access to a wide range of features, including setting up and configuring any New Relic data-reporting tool, running queries of your data, using our logs UI, making custom charts and dashboards, and setting up alerts. Unlike full users, they do not have access to our Full-Stack Observability features and some Applied Intelligence features (for a detailed comparison, see Capabilities). Basic users will see prompts to become a full user when they attempt to access unavailable features. For details, see Upgrade. Full user. Details: Full users have access to our Full-Stack Observability features, which include curated UI experiences like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, mobile monitoring, synthetic monitors, access to New Relic One apps, and more. For details, see Capabilities. Standard edition includes one free full user and up to five total full users. A full user can downgrade to a basic user twice in a 12-month period. To see and edit a user's user type, use the User management UI. Learn more about basic user versus full user differences: Compare full vs basic capabilities Below is a table comparing what basic users and full users can do. In short: basic users have access to our Telemetry Data Platform and some Applied Intelligence features, while full users have theoretical access to everything (dependent on any group-related restrictions). Another way to think about this is that full users are users with access to Full Stack Observability, which gates our more curated UI features. Features Full user Basic user Full-Stack Observability (Curated UI experiences) Application performance monitoring (APM) UI Infrastructure monitoring UI Digital Experience Monitoring UI, which includes: Browser monitoring UI Mobile monitoring UI Synthetic monitoring UI Synthetics checks Serverless monitoring UI Logs in context Distributed tracing Infinite Tracing (Pro and Enterprise edition) Assorted UI experiences, including: Kubernetes cluster explorer UI Key transaction UI Workloads UI Manage other users Access to New Relic One apps Can build apps but can't access other apps Applied Intelligence Automatic anomaly detection Correlated alerts and events Anomaly/alert analysis Root cause details in issues Telemetry Data Platform Data ingest from any source (agents, integrations, APIs) Query your data Create custom charts and dashboards Alerts and notifications Our APIs, including NerdGraph (GraphQL) (with some restrictions) Query and chart log data Build New Relic One apps (but cannot access other apps) Encryption at rest Standard data retention Security and compliance Data management Note that the pricing edition (Standard, Pro, or Enterprise) will also affect what features you have access to. For organizations with New Relic One pricing, learn more about how full users impact billing. Tips on choosing user type A user's type (basic user vs full user) is meant to be a long-term assignment, based on the New Relic responsibilities that user is expected to perform. A full user can be downgraded to a basic user only twice in one year. Below are tips for why you'd choose full user versus basic user. Reasons to make someone a full user: They play a key role in the development, testing, deployment, and maintenance phases of the application development lifecycle. They break/fix code regularly; they are responsible for triaging workflows, troubleshooting, or managing users and roles for their team. They have DevOps practices (i.e. version control systems and implement CI/CD). They need to use New Relic's curated dashboards and experiences (not just the ability to create their own custom queries and charts); in other words, they need full access to our platform. They need to be able to manage users and/or billing. Reasons to make someone a basic user: They play a key role in the planning phase of the application development lifecycle. They use and configure New Relic agents, APIs, and integrations to send us data, and access, configure, and use alerts on such data (not necessarily responsible for triaging workflows, troubleshooting, or managing users and roles for their team). They want to see high-level analytics and business metrics for future planning (such as C-Suite executives). They do not need to use our curated experiences and dashboards, but would benefit from the ability to create their own custom queries and charts of data; in other words, they don't need full access to the platform. They don't manage users. For accounts on New Relic One pricing, learn more about user-related billing calculations. Understand user-related billing If you're on the New Relic One pricing plan, full users are billable, and there are restrictions around how often a full user can downgrade to a basic user. For details, see User count billing details. For how to query and alert on usage data, see Query usage data. Have questions about why you can't access something? See Factors affecting access. Default groups: Admin and User For users on our New Relic One user model, a \"group\" is what allows the grouping together and managing of multiple users at the same time. Your New Relic users are assigned to a group, and that group is granted access to specific roles on specific accounts. We have two default groups: User: This group allows a user to use and configure monitoring/analysis features but not perform account-related tasks like managing billing or users. It has access to the All product admin role, which gives access to our observability platform tools but not to the organization and user management capabilities governed by the Organization manager and Authentication manager roles. Admin: has full access and capabilities, including the organization-level admin abilities. This is the equivalent of having the All product admin, the Billing user, the Organization manager and the Authentication domain manager roles. These groups are added inside your default authentication domain, which includes the default settings of users a) being managed via New Relic and b) logging in via standard email and password. If you add other authentication domains (for SAML SSO and/or SCIM provisioning of users), you'd have new custom groups in those new domains to govern those users. Note that groups, whether default or custom, are not what limit a user's capabilities: it is the role that is assigned to that group (with any basic user restrictions on top of that). If your organization is Pro or Enterprise edition and you want to understand how users are granted access to specific roles and accounts, see Access grants. To change the group a user is in, use the User management UI. How do user type, roles, and groups relate to each other? For users on the New Relic One user model, here's a table explaining how user type (basic vs full user), roles, and groups relate to each other: Full user Basic user Group Full users can be assigned to default groups (User and Admin) or custom groups. When basic users are added to a group, that group's role-related restrictions apply. A basic user's capabilities can be restricted in that way, but a basic user can never be granted more capabilities than they start with. For Standard edition, basic users can't be assigned to groups. For Pro and Enterprise edition, they can. Role For an explanation of the roles our default groups have, see Default groups. Custom groups can have either our default standard roles, or custom roles. A basic user's abilities aren't directly defined by a specific role. A basic user can best be described as having the All product admin role but without access to Full Stack Observability features (learn more about user type). When basic users are added to a group, that group's role-related restrictions apply, but a basic user can never be granted more capabilities than they start with. Roles and capabilities For users on the New Relic One user model, a \"role\" can be defined as \"a set of capabilities.\" A capability is defined as the ability to do a specific New Relic task, like 'Delete alert conditions' (learn more about capabilities). Roles are assigned to user groups. Our default groups Admin and User already have our standard roles (defined below) assigned. Organizations on Pro or Enterprise edition can also create custom roles. Standard (default) roles Roles are sets of capabilities. We have several \"standard roles,\" which are roles that satisfy some commonly needed use cases. To view roles and their associated capabilities, use the Organization and access UI. Important Note that some of our standard roles have hidden, non-exposed capabilities that are not available for selection when creating a custom role. The only standard roles that can be replicated with a custom role are Standard user and Read only; all others have some hidden capabilities. Our standard roles include: Standard roles Scope Description All product admin Account Provides admin-level access to observability platform features but not organization-level and user management features. In other words, this role includes all New Relic capabilities with the exception of managing users (Authentication domain manager role), managing organization/account-structure settings (Organization manager role), and managing billing (Billing user role). Note: the Standard user role is essentially the All product admin role minus observability feature configuration capabilities. Standard user Account Provides access to observability platform features, but lacks permissions for configuring those features (for example, ability to configure synthetic monitor secure credentials) and lacks organization-level and user management permissions. Note: the Standard user role is essentially the All product admin role without that role's ability to configure platform features. Billing user Account Provides ability to manage subscriptions and billing setup, and read-only access to the rest of the platform. For organizations with multiple accounts, billing is aggregated in the primary (first-created) account, which is why assigning this role to that primary account grants billing permissions for the entire organization. Organization manager Organization Provides the ability to manage organization settings, including organization structure, name, and preferences. Due to our recent switch to the New Relic One user model, this role currently has few abilities but more will be added over time. For how to grant this role, see Add user management capability. Organization read only Organization Provides the ability to view organization-level settings. For how to grant this role, see Add user management capability. Authentication domain manager Organization Provides ability to add and manage users, and configure authentication domains for users on the New Relic One user model. For how to grant this role, see Add user management capability. Authentication domain read only Organization Provides the ability to view users in your organization and view the configuration of authentication domains. For how to grant this role, see Add user management capability. Read only Account Provides read-only access to the New Relic platform (except for synthetic monitor secure credentials). Manage v1 users Account For New Relic organizations that existed before July 30 2020 and have users on our original user model, this role lets you manage those \"v1\" users. For more about how you'd assign roles to groups and create custom roles, see the user management tutorial. Capabilities A role, whether one of our standard roles or a custom role, is defined as a set of capabilities. To view roles and their associated capabilities, use the Organization and access UI. Important Some of our standard roles have hidden capabilities that aren't available for selection when creating a custom role. For details, see Standard roles. A view of the capabilities associated with the All product admin role. When creating a custom role, you select a custom set of capabilities. Note that the capabilities we expose may change over time: this screenshot was taken in April of 2021. For how to set up roles with custom capabilities, see the user management tutorial. Manage users To learn how to add users, assign them to groups, and create custom groups and roles, see Manage users. 2020 user model changes If you'd like to understand how our user model changed in 2020 and what the impacts of that change were, see User model changes.",

      "body": "We use this dictionary to ensure consistency across our docs site. Other than the terms listed here, we generally follow the Microsoft Style Guide, but we'll use Chicago Manual of Style in a pinch. We also follow American English conventions, rather than British English ones. For a glossary of terminology specific to New Relic, see the public glossary on the docs site. account ID A unique number that identifies a particular New Relic account. Don't use account number. agent Don't capitalize. Install the Ruby agent, not Install the Ruby Agent. Don't refer to a Synthetics private minion as an agent. am and pm Use the 12-hour clock followed by the (lowercased) time period am or pm. Don’t put a space after the last number in a timestamp (12:00am, not 12:00 am). Don't include a leading 0 when the hour is less than 10. 9:30am, 12:30pm, 8:30pm Copy Amazon Web Services (AWS) product names Refer to the specific product, not just AWS broadly. As a courtesy to your readers, on first mention always refer to Amazon products by their full names; for example Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can use the acronym after that, if there is one. Example: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. After that, use the short name according to the AWS Documentation site. Example: Amazon EC2. app name vs. app alias The \"machine name\" that the collector uses to uniquely identify an app is its app name. The server-side configuration setting that changes the visible \"name\" of an app without changing its unique identifier is its app alias. beta Use the beta callout. In the body text, use lowercase. For example: BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. If the developer team prefers to use a term other than beta or private beta, clarify what is driving that use of the term (Legal requirement?), and add any relevant info here in the usage dictionary. bits and bytes Use standard prefixes and capitalization for International System of Units (SI), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), or Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC memory) values when referring to multiples of bits (b) and bytes (B). 1 byte = 8 bits. Decimal value SI prefix Binary value ISO prefix JEDEC prefix 1000 k: kilo 1024 Ki: kibi K: kilo 1000^2 M: mega 1024^2 Mi: mebi M: mega 1000^3 G: giga 1024^3 Gi: gibi G: giga 1000^4 T: tera 1024^4 Ti: tebi - -- 1000^5 P: peta 1024^5 Pi: pebi - -- Tip For help with converting byte values (such as bytes to kilobytes), try this byte converter. blacklist and whitelist Don't use. Instead, use deny list and allow list; for example, \"Add a hostname to your deny list.\" capitalization This is more complex than can be covered in this usage dictionary. For detailed information, see: Heading capitalization Capitalization of features and UI elements Child account A parent account contains one or more child accounts. Child accounts were previously referred to as \"sub-accounts\". click In general, use click rather than the vaguer select. For example, you might click something in the UI, but then select something from a list. Be particularly careful to use click to describe actions that only make sense with a mouse; for example, with a right click or a click and drag. Also use click when the user must click on a non-selectable object (to save your changes, click anywhere outside the dialog box). See also [mouse over] #mouse-over). collector vs. connect to New Relic When referring to an agent talking to the New Relic servers, describe this as the New Relic collector. Although internally the collector refers only to specific parts of our architecture, we use it more broadly in our documentation to mean \"any endpoint a customer must connect to report data, for any product.\" Avoid \"connect to New Relic,\" and do not use \"connect to the New Relic UI.\" contractions When it makes sense for clarity, conciseness, and tone and voice, use contractions. Use them where they make the writing sound more like natural speech, and where they improve clarity and accessibility without sacrificing expertise and authority. There are no hard and fast rules for which contractions are or aren't acceptable, but simple and common is preferable to complicated and rare. For example, it's for it is is fine, but less common constructions like mustn't or wouldn't've are best avoided. Also: When using a negative contraction (don't, can't, won't) try to provide some additional info about what what to do and what can be done. (See the style guide intro for more on this.) There are places in our docs—for example, in notes and warnings—where spelling out do not, cannot, or will not is preferable to contractions to emphasize the action or blockage to be avoided. customer vs. user When possible, use the second person you to form a sense of connection with the reader. For times when you need a descriptive third-person noun, keep the following guidelines in mind: customer and user are both appropriate depending on context. customer makes more sense when talking about billing, or about a group of people or a business entity. For example, one customer may have one or more individual users who interact with New Relic through the customer's account(s). user makes more sense as a general term for an individual user, or when talking about users as an object in the account model. For example, when discussing account models, it's important to be specific about what constitutes a single person identity in our system. dashboard Don't use. Instead, use page. doc, document, documentation, docs site If you need to refer to the docs themselves—don't. Generally it's better to directly link to the doc you're referencing and use the doc title as your link text. For example, See [Install the .NET agent](URL) rather than See our [.NET agent install docs](URL). If there's not a good alternative, doc generally sounds more natural than document or documentation. If you're tempted to use a longer form, try reading it aloud to see which reads best. If you must refer to the site as a whole, call it the docs site rather than Docs site or documentation site. Internally, you can also refer to the whole URL docs.newrelic.com to avoid ambiguity with other sources of docs like internal platform docs or API explorer docs. To refer to our docs GitHub repo, use the repo name docs-website or the repo path newrelic/docs-website. dropdown Use dropdown instead of drop-down or drop down. Although it isn't common usage, you can use dropdown independently as a noun, without needing to say dropdown menu or dropdown list. For example, select a date from the <b>date</b> dropdown. e.g. and i.e. Don't use Latin abbreviations. Instead of e.g., use for example or such as. Instead of i.e. or its English equivalent in other words, rewrite so your description is clear. em dash (—) Em dashes are rarely needed in tech docs, sadly. You can usually accomplish what you need to by breaking the thought into multiple sentences or using parentheses. In some rare cases, though, an em dash can add drama and spice. If you think you've found such a case, make sure you use them right. An em dash should always use the real em dash character (not a hyphen), and no space before and after. For example: You can sign up for New Relic fast and free—we won't even ask for a credit card number. Copy You can insert an em dash with the COMMAND+OPTION+- shortcut or use the HTML entity. etc. Unlike the Latin abbreviations e.g. or i.e.), you're welcome to use etc. Please ensure that you have several meaningful examples, though, before using. For example, cities including Portland, Seattle, Dublin, etc. but not cities including Portland, etc.. hostname This is one word. Don't hyphenate. icons When using an inline icon from the UI, always describe it first, then embed the icon image, and then end with the word icon. For example, select the delete icon. Don't put icons in bold. When writing about icons, describe the icon for its purpose or action, not what the icon looks like. For example: Yes: Select the edit icon. No: Select the pencil icon. For technical information on embedding images, see Inserting inline images and Embedding Font Awesome icons. index A list of entities, such as the APM applications index, the Synthetics Monitors index, or the Alerts Incidents index. See also page. infrastructure Don't use, unless referring to the New Relic Infrastructure product. Instead, use an appropriate substitute such as architecture, environment, system, host, etc. introduction Always use Introduction to for overview docs for a particular product. For example, Introduction to New Relic Infrastructure or Introduction to the PHP agent or Introduction to transaction traces. Don't use welcome to, basics, intro, overview, etc. Also avoid the Thing: Tagline format, as in X-Ray sessions: Traces and thread profiles for key transactions, unless having a title with keywords will help with SEO. macOS The proper name for Apple's desktop operating system is macOS. Don't use the older product names Mac OS X or OS X. master account We previously used \"master account\" and \"sub-account\" but now we use parent account and child account. menu The list of pages and indexes on the top and left sides of the New Relic user interface. mouse over For mouse movements that involve placing the mouse pointer over an area, but not clicking it. For example, the APM Overview page includes functions that are only visible when the mouse pointer is over a particular chart. Do not use point to or hover over. See also click. .NET Always refer to the agent and language as .NET, never as .Net or .net or dotnet. New Relic One New Relic One isn't a product. It's a way to view New Relic data more easily, all in one place, and from multiple related accounts. This has several implications for how we should refer to it: Avoid phrasing that makes New Relic One sound like a separate product or a separate platform. There is a single New Relic platform through which our users interact with our products. Avoid mentioning New Relic One where it can be avoided. For example, instead of saying \"Use New Relic One workloads to...\", you could instead say, \"In New Relic, you can use workloads to...\" and then in the doc explain where to find the feature. Another example: instead of referring to \"The programmable New Relic One platform,\" we might say, \"The New Relic platform is programmable: To start building, go to one.newrelic.com and...\" Do not use NR1 or nr1 as an abbreviation of New Relic One. The only reason to use nr1 is when referring to the nr1 package or library (for example: a reference to the command nr1 nerdpack:serve). In general, we want to avoid overloading our docs with \"New Relic\". For more details, see the New Relic One messaging guidelines, the docs glossary entry, or the New Relic One docs. Node.js Always refer to the programming language as Node.js, not Node. NR ONLY Use NR ONLY for internal consumption only (such as this style guide). Don't use NR-ONLY or NRONLY or New Relic Only. Oxford comma See serial comma. open source Use lower case for open source. Some legal contracts may require upper case. page A specific place in the New Relic UI, located at a particular URL. Compare and contrast index, menu, and UI. Don't use dashboard, menu, tab, screen, or similar terms. parent account New Relic organizations can have a parent/child account structure. This is more important for our original user model but still plays a role for some behind-the-scenes features on our New Relic One user model. Learn more about account structure. Parent accounts were previously referred to as master accounts, and there are still some uses of this in the codebase. permissions See User-related language. For pricing tier/edition language, see Pricing language. pricing See Pricing language. real user monitoring (RUM) Don't use this outside of browser monitoring docs. Often abbreviated as RUM, this is a generic industry term for browser monitoring. New Relic refers to this as page load timing or browser monitoring. Use this term only for SEO or clarification, not to refer to the actual feature. record vs. report vs. collect Use report when discussing data sent to New Relic, such as, \"your host reports data to New Relic.\" Avoid using report as a noun. Instead use \"the reported metrics\" or \"the collected data.\" If \"report\" sounds too clunky, you can also use collect as long as whatever New Relic is collecting doesn't sound security sensitive. RPM Don't refer to the New Relic UI as RPM. Always refer to the specific product, such as the APM UI or the Browser UI. However, you may use rpm when required in the visible URL string in UI paths. serial comma Also referred to as an Oxford comma. Always use serial commas with inline lists. For example, Portland, Seattle, and Dublin rather than Portland, Seattle and Dublin. time zone Include a space (time zone). Don't hyphenate or run together as timezone. UI The graphical component of a New Relic product, encompassing all its pages, menus, and indexes. See also UI paths. UI paths If you need to tell a user how to path through the UI, see our style guide page on UI paths. update vs. upgrade Use update when users need to change the version of whatever they're using. No money or payment is needed for an update. Use upgrade whenever money or payment may be involved, such as upgrading to the Pro version of a product. The new pricing model makes it unlikely that you'll need to use this. users For styles and formats related to user roles and groups and more, see User-related style. username, not user name One word (username), not two. This is the most common usage and is recommended by Microsoft and Google style guides. version number references When referring to multiple version numbers, always use or higher. Don't use and higher, or the words greater or later. Also don't use punctuation, as in version 1.2+. For example: Foo requires Ruby agent version 1.2.3 or higher. Copy In addition: Tell users to use the latest version and not an up-to-date or current version. To abbreviate the word version, use a lowercase v with no space before the number; for example, v2 or v1.2.3. Use update not upgrade when talking about agent versions, as in \"To update to the latest version...\" For security reasons, do not use version numbers with licensing docs. The Tech Docs team doesn't have a set standard when referring to previous versions. Recommendation: Consider using version x.x or lower when identifying a specific version. Consider using In earlier agent versions when referring to versions more vaguely. we Say “we” and “our” when it works with the flow of your writing. Avoid overloading paragraphs with “New Relic” mentions, or reword so the focus is on the user, not New Relic. For example, avoid writing something like this: New Relic recommends setting a startup timeout. Copy Instead, write something like this: Recommendation: To help with troubleshooting, include a startup timeout in your configuration. Copy OR We recommend setting a startup timeout. Copy you We use “you” and “your” liberally in our docs. Addressing the reader directly makes for simpler, cleaner sentences. It also tends to expose lazy uses of passive construction and it helps users to understand procedures.",

You can also view SLA reports for individual monitors: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > SLA. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report: Use SLA reports to understand your monitors' performance over time. Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

View the report in Excel or an external program Select Download this report as .csv to download a copy of your SLA data. Open the file in Excel, Google Drive, or another spreadsheet editor to analyze your data. Change your Apdex targets The default Apdex T for all monitors is 7 seconds. You can customize your Apdex T target for individual monitors by editing your monitor. Change the time frame Choose from daily, weekly, or monthly aggregation by selecting the appropriate tab. Make the report public Change the Public SLA setting to ON to allow non-authenticated users to view the report. Select Share Report to get the public URL to share. Generate SLA values The values in the SLA report are generated from Insights queries against the available synthetic monitoring data. You can easily recreate these values and modify the queries to meet your needs. This query returns the average duration, the apdex, and the uptime. Substitute your values for the variables highlighted and described below. SELECT average(duration), apdex(duration, t:), percentage(count(*), WHERE result='SUCCESS') FROM SyntheticCheck FACET timeperiod Copy Variable Value t: Supply the Apdex T that you would like to calculate your apdex against. The duration attribute in the SyntheticCheck event is stored in milliseconds, so an Apdex T value of 7 seconds should be included as 7000. timeperiod This is the period that you would like to calculate on. For a daily report, facet on dateOf(timestamp), for a weekly report facet on weekOf(timestamp) and for a monthly report facet on monthOf(timestamp). NRQL queries default to querying against the last hour of data. In order to widen the scope of your data you will need to include a SINCE clause at the end of your query. Example #1: Daily report for the last week To generate a daily report for the last week you would add SINCE 1 week ago: SELECT average(duration), apdex(duration, t:), percentage(count(*), WHERE result='SUCCESS') FROM SyntheticCheck FACET dateOf(timestamp) SINCE 1 week ago Copy Example #2: Report for a particular monitor To scope the results to a particular monitor you can edit the above query to include a specific monitor name: SELECT average(duration), apdex(duration, t:), percentage(count(*), WHERE result='SUCCESS') FROM SyntheticCheck FACET timeperiod WHERE monitorName = 'mymonitorname' Copy Example #3: Report for multiple monitors To scope the results to a collection of monitors: SELECT average(duration), apdex(duration, t:), percentage(count(*), WHERE result='SUCCESS') FROM SyntheticCheck FACET timeperiod WHERE monitorName IN ('mymonitor1', 'mymonitor2', 'mymonitor3') Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Access your monitors (view your list of monitors, and view current summary statistics for each monitor) Add and edit monitors (edit your monitor settings to customize Apdex targets for individual monitors) APM SLA reports (SLA reporting for your APM application)",

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

      "body": "Use the Synthetics REST API to create and manage synthetic monitors of all types: ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test monitors. All synthetic monitoring data is available via the REST API. To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have a user role that allows that capability and a user key. For an overview of all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Features The newest version of the Synthetics API (v3) adds these features: Synthetics API (v3) Features Options field for POST and PUT request You can specify the options for SIMPLE and BROWSER type monitors, similar to the way these options are available in the UI. PATCH request You can update only the fields of a monitor you want to change, rather than having to specify the entire monitor entity in a PUT. You can also specify the OPTION, assuming you are using the appropriate type of monitor. More detail with 400 Bad Request errors As of v3, the Synthetics API attempts to return as much information as possible when a validation failure occurs. This will help you figure out what might be wrong with the request. The API runs all validations and returns any failed validation messages, rather than failing on the first validation error as occurred in previous API versions. Pagination Large API responses are properly paginated. You can also use NRQL queries to analyze past changes made via the API. Monitor types in API These are the monitor types and how they're referred to in the API: Monitor type API name Ping SIMPLE Simple browser BROWSER Scripted browser SCRIPT_BROWSER API test SCRIPT_API Use the API To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have the ability to manage synthetics monitors and use a user key (the REST API key won't work). This API can be used for all Synthetics monitors. (Additional API methods for scripted browser and API test monitors are also available to update the script associated with those monitors.) All Synthetics data is available via the API. API examples show cURL commands. For US-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy For EU-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.eu.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. Get all monitors To view a list of all the monitors in your New Relic account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": \"2a1bc369-7654-489d-918e-f6g135h7i2jk\", \"name\": \"monitor1\", \"type\": \"BROWSER\", \"frequency\": 60, \"uri\": \"http://example.com\", \"locations\": [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\": \"DISABLED\", \"slaThreshold\": 7, \"options\": {}, \"modifiedAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"createdAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"userId\": 0, \"apiVersion\": \"0.2.2\" } ], \"count\": 1 } Copy Query arguments: offset: The monitor count offset. Defaults to 0. For example, if you have 40 monitors and you use an offset value of 20, it will return monitors 21-40. limit: The number of results per page, maximum 100. Defaults to 50. You can include these in your cURL command as follows: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -G -d 'offset=20&limit=100' Copy The headers include a Link to help you easily page your monitors. For example: <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=0&limit=20>; rel=\"first\", <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=40&limit=20>; rel=\"last\" Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single Synthetics monitor, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your Synthetics account, send a POST request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor. All fields in the following example are required unless stated otherwise: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, \"options\": { \"validationString\": string [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"verifySSL\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"bypassHEADRequest\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types], \"treatRedirectAsFailure\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types] } } Copy In addition, to add the script for a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values: curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\", \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\" : \"1.0\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example: the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. All fields are required. However, the TYPE of the monitor cannot be changed. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\": \"monitor type\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Patch an existing monitor To patch an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PATCH request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PATCH -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\" }' Copy PATCH requests are intended to update individual attributes of your New Relic Synthetics monitor rather than updating the entire entity, so you may provide only the attributes you want to update. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds, or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic Synthetics, send a DELETE request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -X DELETE $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get a list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic Synthetics, use the following command: curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v1/locations Copy Script API for scripted browser and API test monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted browsers (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and API test browsers (SCRIPT_API). These examples show cURL commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script. For example: curl -v -H 'Api-Key: $API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic Synthetics with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the $MONITOR_UUID/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":BASE64 encoded string}' curl -v -X PUT \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_UUID/script \\ -d $scriptPayload Copy If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Using private location scripts with verified script execution When creating or updating monitors for private locations that have verified script execution turned on, you must use scriptLocations to set the password: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. If you have multiple locations with Verified script execution enabled each location must have the HMAC calculated. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm with the script and password. Here's an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation: curl -v -X PUT -H 'Api-Key: '$API_KEY' -H 'content-type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT}/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4ZQ==\"} ]}' Copy Important You must remove the last newline character from both the script and the calculated HMAC value before encoding in BASE64. Calculation steps: Calculate the HMAC value from the script. One way is to use: cat script | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac \"password\" > hmac Remove the newline character if one was added by openssl. Encode the HMAC in BASE64 without line breaks. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows cURL commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example shows the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. Tip In some cases you may want to use -w 0, which will disable line wrapping: base64 -w 0 $scriptfile #!/bin/bash # API key from your account settings API_KEY='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -H 'Content-Type:application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload=\"{\\\"scriptText\\\":\\\"$encoded\\\"}\" curl -s -X PUT -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -H 'Content-Type:application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy",

Here's an example: { \"key\": string [required, 1-64 characters uppercase], \"value\": string [required, 1-3,000 characters], \"description\": string [optional] } Copy Here's an example of doing this with a curl command: curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials \\ -d '{ \"key\": \"MYKEY\", \"value\": \"my value\", \"description\": \"Description of MYKEY\" }' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created secure credential specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 303 See Other: The specified key already exists. The returned location header will contain the URI to the key. 400 Bad Request: Key too long or missing, value too long or missing, non-parsable JSON payload. Get all secure credentials To view a list of all the secure credentials in your New Relic account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"secureCredentials\": [ { \"key\": \"MYKEY1\", \"description\": \"Description of MYKEY1\", \"createdAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"lastUpdated\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\" }, { \"key\": \"MYKEY2\", \"description\": \"Description of MYKEY2\", \"createdAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"lastUpdated\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\" } ], \"count\": 2 } Copy Get a specific secure credential To view a single secure credential, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials/$KEY. curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials/$KEY Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"key\": string, \"description\": string, \"createdAt\": date,​ \"lastUpdated\": date } Copy An invalid key will return 404 Not Found: The specified key doesn't exist. Update an existing secure credential To update an existing credential in New Relic, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials/$KEY. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials/$KEY \\ -d '{ \"key\": \"MYKEY\", \"value\": \"my value\", \"description\": \"Description of MYKEY\" }' Copy An invalid key will return 404 Not Found: The specified key doesn't exist. Delete an existing secure credential To delete an existing credential in New Relic, send a DELETE request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials/$KEY. curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -X DELETE https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/secure-credentials/$KEY Copy Please note that if the specified key does not exist, no error will occur.

Browser monitoring tracks the actual results of webpage performance across all variations of devices, browsers, and connection speeds. Used together, they provide a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and the synthetic monitors. Compare performance and trends New Relic's comparative charting feature helps operations managers and teams by providing: Benchmarks for page load times Additional insights to help you plan where to optimize your site Comparisons of synthetic trends vs. actual browser performance without needing to switch between our monitoring capabilities. For example, during a page outage, you can compare synthetic monitoring trends to actual browser monitoring comparisons to see if an issue is also visible in Synthetics UI, or if it is caused by variables outside of New Relic. This helps you more efficiently know where to take action. What you need The comparative charting feature requires: Browser monitoring enabled with the browser SPA agent (version 885 or higher). A synthetic browser or scripted monitor with one or more tests on the same URLs monitored by the browser agent. After you enable the comparative charting feature either from synthetic or from browser monitoring, no additional setup is required. The comparative charting feature will appear when New Relic finds matching URLs. Enable comparison data After you enable the comparative charting feature from either synthetic or browser monitoring, no additional setup is required. The comparative charting feature will appear whenever synthetics or browser monitoring finds matching URLs.

Browser monitoring tracks the actual results of webpage performance across all variations of devices, browsers, and connection speeds. Used together, they provide a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and the synthetic monitors. Compare performance and trends New Relic's comparative charting feature helps operations managers and teams by providing: Benchmarks for page load times Additional insights to help you plan where to optimize your site Comparisons of synthetic trends vs. actual browser performance without needing to switch between our monitoring capabilities. For example, during a page outage, you can compare synthetic monitoring trends to actual browser monitoring comparisons to see if an issue is also visible in Synthetics UI, or if it is caused by variables outside of New Relic.

IP addresses are not personal data Minions are deployed on servers, and the agents are expected to be activated using non-personal credentials. IP addresses associated with minions running on servers are not personal data under data protection and privacy laws. For more information, see the Synthetic's security documentation. Daily JSON listings for IP addresses IP addresses for released locations are subject to change. If a change is needed, we'll attempt to proactively notify customers prior to any changes via e-mail. You can also check the Explorers Hub for updates. Important Synthetics is adding new IP addresses on July 15 2021.

Browser monitoring tracks the actual results of webpage performance across all variations of devices, browsers, and connection speeds. Used together, they provide a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and the synthetic monitors. Compare performance and trends New Relic's comparative charting feature helps operations managers and teams by providing: Benchmarks for page load times Additional insights to help you plan where to optimize your site Comparisons of synthetic trends vs. actual browser performance without needing to switch between our monitoring capabilities. For example, during a page outage, you can compare synthetic monitoring trends to actual browser monitoring comparisons to see if an issue is also visible in Synthetics UI, or if it is caused by variables outside of New Relic. This helps you more efficiently know where to take action. What you need The comparative charting feature requires: Browser monitoring enabled with the browser SPA agent (version 885 or higher). A synthetic browser or scripted monitor with one or more tests on the same URLs monitored by the browser agent. After you enable the comparative charting feature either from synthetic or from browser monitoring, no additional setup is required. The comparative charting feature will appear when New Relic finds matching URLs. Enable comparison data After you enable the comparative charting feature from either synthetic or browser monitoring, no additional setup is required. The comparative charting feature will appear whenever synthetics or browser monitoring finds matching URLs. Enable comparative charting from Synthetics UI To enable the comparative charting feature from Synthetics UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > Summary. Above the selected monitor's Availability chart, select the ellipsis icon. Select Enable Synthetics comparison. Enable comparative charting from browser monitoring UI To enable the comparison data feature from browser monitoring: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select a browser app) > Page views. Select a page monitored by synthetic monitoring. From the selected page's Performance tab, select the ellipsis icon. Select Enable Synthetics comparison. View comparison data The comparative charting feature appears whenever synthetic monitoring identifies a URL match with browser monitoring and can compare it. You can compare browser and synthetic's performance either from the synthetic monitoring Summary page or from the browser monitoring Page views page (for browser apps or single page apps) without needing to switch between New Relic capabilities. Based on the selected data sources, the summary shows: Overall speed percentage comparison between browser (real user) page views and any matching URLs found in synthetic monitors that the user has permissions to view Number of URLs found in synthetic monitors that match the browser rollup URL To view the comparative charting summary: From synthetic monitoring UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > Summary. OR From browser monitoring UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select a browser app) > Page views, then select a page monitored by synthetic monitoring. Review the comparative charting feature's summary of overall speed percentage and number of matching URLs. To view additional details, select the summary's right arrow icon. Please note that in some cases the simple browser monitor ends before the browser agent has had a chance to collect the BrowserInteraction event. In this case, no comparative charting data is displayed in the UI. In order to resolve this issue, create a scripted browser monitor instead, and add a call to wait (sleep) after the page is loaded. Here is an example: $browser.get('https://www.mywebsite.com').then(function(){ return $browser.sleep(1000); }) Copy Hide or return comparison data To hide the comparative charting feature, select the ellipsis icon.

      "body": "Synthetic monitoring regularly checks your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints to measure optimal performance. Browser monitoring tracks the actual results of webpage performance across all variations of devices, browsers, and connection speeds. Used together, they provide a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser) interactions and the synthetic monitors. Compare performance and trends New Relic's comparative charting feature helps operations managers and teams by providing: Benchmarks for page load times Additional insights to help you plan where to optimize your site Comparisons of synthetic trends vs. actual browser performance without needing to switch between our monitoring capabilities. For example, during a page outage, you can compare synthetic monitoring trends to actual browser monitoring comparisons to see if an issue is also visible in Synthetics UI, or if it is caused by variables outside of New Relic. This helps you more efficiently know where to take action. What you need The comparative charting feature requires: Browser monitoring enabled with the browser SPA agent (version 885 or higher). A synthetic browser or scripted monitor with one or more tests on the same URLs monitored by the browser agent. After you enable the comparative charting feature either from synthetic or from browser monitoring, no additional setup is required. The comparative charting feature will appear when New Relic finds matching URLs. Enable comparison data After you enable the comparative charting feature from either synthetic or browser monitoring, no additional setup is required. The comparative charting feature will appear whenever synthetics or browser monitoring finds matching URLs. Enable comparative charting from Synthetics UI To enable the comparative charting feature from Synthetics UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > Summary. Above the selected monitor's Availability chart, select the ellipsis icon. Select Enable Synthetics comparison. Enable comparative charting from browser monitoring UI To enable the comparison data feature from browser monitoring: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select a browser app) > Page views. Select a page monitored by synthetic monitoring. From the selected page's Performance tab, select the ellipsis icon. Select Enable Synthetics comparison. View comparison data The comparative charting feature appears whenever synthetic monitoring identifies a URL match with browser monitoring and can compare it. You can compare browser and synthetic's performance either from the synthetic monitoring Summary page or from the browser monitoring Page views page (for browser apps or single page apps) without needing to switch between New Relic capabilities. Based on the selected data sources, the summary shows: Overall speed percentage comparison between browser (real user) page views and any matching URLs found in synthetic monitors that the user has permissions to view Number of URLs found in synthetic monitors that match the browser rollup URL To view the comparative charting summary: From synthetic monitoring UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > Summary. OR From browser monitoring UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select a browser app) > Page views, then select a page monitored by synthetic monitoring. Review the comparative charting feature's summary of overall speed percentage and number of matching URLs. To view additional details, select the summary's right arrow icon. Please note that in some cases the simple browser monitor ends before the browser agent has had a chance to collect the BrowserInteraction event. In this case, no comparative charting data is displayed in the UI. In order to resolve this issue, create a scripted browser monitor instead, and add a call to wait (sleep) after the page is loaded. Here is an example: $browser.get('https://www.mywebsite.com').then(function(){ return $browser.sleep(1000); }) Copy Hide or return comparison data To hide the comparative charting feature, select the ellipsis icon. To keep it visible but move it away from the top of the page, select Move to bottom. To return it to its original place on the page, select Move to top. To remove it from the page, select Hide all Synthetics/Browser comparisons. To return it to the page after removing it, follow standard procedures to enable comparison charting. Data sources New Relic uses these data sources for the synthetics and browser comparison in the UI. For deeper analysis of the comparative chart data you see in the UI, use the query builder to run NRQL queries. Variable Description Monitor account ID The account from which you are running the monitor: SELECT monitorAccountId FROM BrowserInteraction Copy Monitor ID The unique ID assigned to your synthetic monitor: SELECT monitorId FROM BrowserInteraction Copy Monitor job ID The ID of a single synthetics monitor run, which began at a specific time and originated from a specific location: SELECT monitorJobId FROM BrowserInteraction LIMIT 1 Copy Real user average The average page load time for real users viewing your website (excludes synthetic monitors). Real user page views Page view details coming from visitors to your website (exclude synthetic monitors). Synthetic's average The average page load time from the synthetic simple or scripted monitors that ran on your website.

      "body": "Use SLA reports to view summary performance metrics across time or multiple monitors. Compare your current performance to historical metrics with daily, weekly, and monthly reporting. View synthetic monitoring SLA reports To view your account-wide SLA report: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report. Choose from reports aggregated by day, week, or month by selecting Daily, Weekly, or Monthly as appropriate. You can also view SLA reports for individual monitors: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > SLA. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report: Use SLA reports to understand your monitors' performance over time. Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test). Use page functions SLA reports support the following features: If you want to... Do this... View the report in Excel or an external program Select Download this report as .csv to download a copy of your SLA data. Open the file in Excel, Google Drive, or another spreadsheet editor to analyze your data. Change your Apdex targets The default Apdex T for all monitors is 7 seconds. You can customize your Apdex T target for individual monitors by editing your monitor. Change the time frame Choose from daily, weekly, or monthly aggregation by selecting the appropriate tab. Make the report public Change the Public SLA setting to ON to allow non-authenticated users to view the report. Select Share Report to get the public URL to share. Generate SLA values The values in the SLA report are generated from Insights queries against the available synthetic monitoring data. You can easily recreate these values and modify the queries to meet your needs. This query returns the average duration, the apdex, and the uptime. Substitute your values for the variables highlighted and described below. SELECT average(duration), apdex(duration, t:), percentage(count(*), WHERE result='SUCCESS') FROM SyntheticCheck FACET timeperiod Copy Variable Value t: Supply the Apdex T that you would like to calculate your apdex against. The duration attribute in the SyntheticCheck event is stored in milliseconds, so an Apdex T value of 7 seconds should be included as 7000. timeperiod This is the period that you would like to calculate on. For a daily report, facet on dateOf(timestamp), for a weekly report facet on weekOf(timestamp) and for a monthly report facet on monthOf(timestamp). NRQL queries default to querying against the last hour of data. In order to widen the scope of your data you will need to include a SINCE clause at the end of your query. Example #1: Daily report for the last week To generate a daily report for the last week you would add SINCE 1 week ago: SELECT average(duration), apdex(duration, t:), percentage(count(*), WHERE result='SUCCESS') FROM SyntheticCheck FACET dateOf(timestamp) SINCE 1 week ago Copy Example #2: Report for a particular monitor To scope the results to a particular monitor you can edit the above query to include a specific monitor name: SELECT average(duration), apdex(duration, t:), percentage(count(*), WHERE result='SUCCESS') FROM SyntheticCheck FACET timeperiod WHERE monitorName = 'mymonitorname' Copy Example #3: Report for multiple monitors To scope the results to a collection of monitors: SELECT average(duration), apdex(duration, t:), percentage(count(*), WHERE result='SUCCESS') FROM SyntheticCheck FACET timeperiod WHERE monitorName IN ('mymonitor1', 'mymonitor2', 'mymonitor3') Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Access your monitors (view your list of monitors, and view current summary statistics for each monitor) Add and edit monitors (edit your monitor settings to customize Apdex targets for individual monitors) APM SLA reports (SLA reporting for your APM application)",

      "body": "New Relic's synthetic monitoring uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. By design, it captures what is essentially performance data for simulated traffic. It does not capture or handle any personal data by default. All data handled by synthetic monitors is expected to be non-personal. This document provides additional details about what we do to ensure data privacy and security with synthetic monitoring, plus additional options you can use. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. What we do Here's a summary of the data privacy and security measures that New Relic provides for you. Data privacy and security Comments No personal data By definition, all data collected through synthetic monitoring is test data created for the purpose of monitoring. None of this data includes personal data from any individual. TLS TLS encryption is required for all domains. This applies to public locations and private locations. Authentication Synthetic monitoring supports a variety of authentication mechanisms, including Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. Available options depend on the type of monitor you choose. Data collection The data transferred to the synthetic endpoint includes: Monitor run results, including full request and response headers of all requests, a complete HAR file of the session, and any screenshots captured (on failure or manually) Polling for available jobs in the private location's queue Private minion \"heartbeat\" every 30 seconds The SyntheticsPrivateMinion event contains basic minion status, including job success and failure counts, queue size, minion version, etc. Data received Data received from the synthetic monitoring endpoint contains the scheduled check's details. This includes the information necessary to complete the check for the minion: Target URL Validation text Full script (for synthetic scripted browser monitors) Data storage location Data collected by synthetic monitoring is stored in the region selected by each customer for their account (US or EU). Monitor configuration details (including frequency, check locations, target URL, and the full script for any scripted browser or API test monitors) are stored on our end. We also store all monitor check results for each monitor type. Data storage by monitor type For ping monitors, data storage includes the HAR file, which includes all requests and responses made during the check. For simple browsers, scripted browsers, and API tests, data storage includes the following: The HAR file includes full request and response headers for all requests made during the check. Any screenshots taken during the check are automatically included for simple and scripted browser monitors only on failure. However, you can manually configure this with scripting. The browser log (JS console) is automatically included for simple and scripted browsers. Any script output is included for scripted browsers and API test monitors. Response bodies New Relic never stores response bodies from requests originated by synthetic monitoring, unless you have manually configured a monitor script to do so. IP addresses Synthetic public minions are expected to be activated using non-personal credentials. Their IP addresses are not defined as personal data under data protection and privacy laws. What you can do For additional levels of security and data privacy, consider using these options. Additional measures Comments User access To control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations, set up role-based synthetic monitoring permissions and user groups. In addition, to track and be notified about changes, use audit logs and alert notifications. Passwords, API keys, user names, etc. To securely store sensitive information, use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The credentials are securely stored using AES-GCM 256-bit encryption at rest with keys managed by Amazon AWS Key Management Service (KMS). Sites behind firewalls To control what sites you want to monitor behind your firewall, you can: Add the synthetic public minion IP addresses to your allow list or deny list. Use private locations to monitor sites or endpoints. This can provide an extra layer of security when monitoring your internally hosted sites and services. Web pages behind login pages If you configure synthetic monitoring to track website areas that are located behind a login page, be sure to create a non-personal login specifically for this purpose. This unique login will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. Proxy configuration Aside from the target URLs monitored by New Relic, private minions will regularly send data to and receive from the synthetic monitoring endpoint. To configure a proxy for all traffic to and from this endpoint, set the MINION_API_PROXY environment variable on the minion host. Private minions security To ensure that only the scripts you intend to run are allowed to run on private minions, use verified script execution.",

Use the Synthetics REST API to manage monitors. Set up monitors from specific locations or for private servers. You can also use the host not reporting feature in infrastructure monitoring. This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts. Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed. Ping monitor API name: SIMPLE Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. The monitor can be configured to: Assert text Assert title Assert an element Click an element Dismiss a modal Double click an element Hover an element Navigate to a URL Secure a credential Select from a dropdown Type text Simple browser monitors API name: BROWSER Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results.",

      "body": "Synthetic monitoring is a suite of automated, scriptable tools to monitor your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. You can simulate user traffic to proactively detect and resolve outages and poor performance of critical endpoints before your customers notice. Why it matters With synthetic monitoring, you can: Get the context of failures by connecting the availability and performance of endpoints to the underlying applications and infrastructure. Easily diagnose if an issue stems from the network or AWS location, a slow third party resource, or the health of backend services or infrastructure. Add synthetic monitoring into build automation and CI/CD pipelines to automatically track performance and check functionality for each deployment. Expand your monitoring further with real, Selenium-powered scripted browsers, which test login procedures, searches, and other critical business transactions. Monitor your API endpoints with API tests Advanced testing Synthetic monitoring allows you to proactively monitor your website or API endpoint to ensure your content is not only available, but fully functional. Synthetic monitoring browser tests send real, Selenium-powered Google Chrome browsers to your site from locations around the world to ensure your content is always up, everywhere. Scripted browsers expand your testing capabilities, so you can test uncommon user flows or beta-test complex procedures. For example, ensure your users are able to sign up for your newsletter, add an item to their cart, or search for and find a piece of critical content with a simple JavaScript-like language. Test your backend with API monitors, which allow you to run scripted tests against any API endpoint. Enhanced monitoring and reporting Synthetic monitoring aggregates the results of each check into metrics, allowing you to see patterns and identify causes of poor performance. Synthetic monitoring also stores each and every monitor result, so you can see exactly where your website broke down. Alerts notify you if your website or API endpoint is inaccessible. You can even expand your geographical coverage or monitor internal websites by creating private locations. You can also query your monitor results for a closer look. New Relic retains monitor results for thirteen months, ensuring you can compare usage year over year. Additional features Synthetic monitoring includes the following features: Feature Description Real browsers With simple browser and scripted browser monitors, synthetic monitoring doesn't simply check that your host is up. It loads the actual page content in a real, fully virtualized Google Chrome browser (powered by Selenium) to provide testing that mirrors your users' actions. Detailed results view Synthetic monitoring stores every single run of your monitor for 13 months, so you can view a detailed breakdown of each and every check. You can get a snapshot of your website's performance and availability, or hunt down specific problems. Comparative charts with browser monitoring Use New Relic's comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser monitoring) interactions and the synthetic monitors. For example, during a page outage, you can compare trends to see if an issue is also visible in synthetic monitoring, or if it is caused by other variables. Advanced scripted monitoring Use scripted browsers to run complex test cases against your website. Ensure critical processes like checkout and login are always running smoothly, and build a baseline to compare against when things go wrong. With a built-in scripting IDE based on Node.js, create scripts quickly without leaving your browser. Global test coverage Check coverage from locations around the world to ensure your users can access your website from anywhere, anytime. Monitor sites behind your firewall by adding the synthetic monitoring static IP addresses to your allow list. Use private locations to monitor internal sites or to expand your coverage to new locations. Compatibility with popular analytics platforms Synthetic monitoring specifically excludes scripts for popular analytics services, like Google Analytics. This ensures your analytics tools continue to receive the exact same data, even with thousands of monitors checking your website each month. You can unblock any of the services blocked by default, or block additional services. REST API functions Synthetic monitoring includes a REST API, which you can use to manage: Simple monitors and scripted monitors Categories and labels for monitors Alert notifications Data protection and privacy The data from synthetic monitoring is test data, representing typical interaction with the webpage or application. It is never actual data from human beings. The data collected when you use synthetic monitoring therefore is not personal data. For more information, see the Synthetic monitoring security documentation. Compatibility and requirements Synthetic monitoring does not require any software except a supported browser. Important To monitor a site behind your firewall, add the synthetic monitoring public minion IP addresses to your allow list. Permissions By default, all users in your account can: View synthetic monitoring pages. Add, edit, and delete monitors. For more fine-grained control, you can enable the optional permissions system. The permissions system allows you to manage the level of access for users to view and edit within synthetic monitoring (for example, monitors and private locations).",

Use the Synthetics REST API to manage monitors. Set up monitors from specific locations or for private servers. You can also use the host not reporting feature in infrastructure monitoring. This allows you to take advantage of enhanced monitoring options and be notified when New Relic has stopped receiving data from your hosts. Types of monitors These are the seven types of synthetic monitors: Type of synthetic monitor Description Broken links monitor Provide a url and this monitor will test all the links on the page for success. If a failure is detected you can view the individual non-successful links that caused the failure. Certificate check monitor Proactively ping your domain certificates based on a configurable threshold. Pair with an alert to ensure you are notified when your certificates need renewed. Ping monitor API name: SIMPLE Ping monitors are the simplest type of monitor. They simply check to see if an application is online. The synthetic ping monitor uses a simple Java HTTP client to make requests to your site. For consistency with other synthetic monitor types, the user agent is identified as Google Chrome. However, the HTTP client is not a full browser, and it does not execute JavaScript. If you need JavaScript functionality, use a simple browser monitor. Step monitor API name: STEP_MONITOR Step monitors are advanced monitors which require no code to set up. The monitor can be configured to: Assert text Assert title Assert an element Click an element Dismiss a modal Double click an element Hover an element Navigate to a URL Secure a credential Select from a dropdown Type text Simple browser monitors API name: BROWSER Simple browser monitors essentially are simple, pre-built scripted browser monitors. They make a request to your site using an instance of Google Chrome. Compared to a simple ping monitor, this is a more accurate emulation of an actual customer visit. The user agent is identified as Google Chrome. Scripted browser monitors API name: SCRIPT_BROWSER Scripted browser monitors are used for more sophisticated, customized monitoring. You can create a custom script that navigates your website, takes specific actions, and ensures specific resources are present. The monitor uses Google Chrome browser. You can also use a variety of third-party modules to build your custom monitor. API tests API name: SCRIPT_API API tests are used to monitor your API endpoints. This can ensure that your app server works in addition to your website. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results.",

You can also view SLA reports for individual monitors: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > SLA. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report: Use SLA reports to understand your monitors' performance over time. Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

View the report in Excel or an external program Select Download this report as .csv to download a copy of your SLA data. Open the file in Excel, Google Drive, or another spreadsheet editor to analyze your data. Change your Apdex targets The default Apdex T for all monitors is 7 seconds. You can customize your Apdex T target for individual monitors by editing your monitor. Change the time frame Choose from daily, weekly, or monthly aggregation by selecting the appropriate tab. Make the report public Change the Public SLA setting to ON to allow non-authenticated users to view the report. Select Share Report to get the public URL to share. Generate SLA values The values in the SLA report are generated from Insights queries against the available synthetic monitoring data. You can easily recreate these values and modify the queries to meet your needs. This query returns the average duration, the apdex, and the uptime. Substitute your values for the variables highlighted and described below. SELECT average(duration), apdex(duration, t:), percentage(count(*), WHERE result='SUCCESS') FROM SyntheticCheck FACET timeperiod Copy Variable Value t: Supply the Apdex T that you would like to calculate your apdex against. The duration attribute in the SyntheticCheck event is stored in milliseconds, so an Apdex T value of 7 seconds should be included as 7000. timeperiod This is the period that you would like to calculate on. For a daily report, facet on dateOf(timestamp), for a weekly report facet on weekOf(timestamp) and for a monthly report facet on monthOf(timestamp).

      "body": "Synthetic monitoring is a suite of automated, scriptable tools to monitor your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. You can simulate user traffic to proactively detect and resolve outages and poor performance of critical endpoints before your customers notice. Why it matters With synthetic monitoring, you can: Get the context of failures by connecting the availability and performance of endpoints to the underlying applications and infrastructure. Easily diagnose if an issue stems from the network or AWS location, a slow third party resource, or the health of backend services or infrastructure. Add synthetic monitoring into build automation and CI/CD pipelines to automatically track performance and check functionality for each deployment. Expand your monitoring further with real, Selenium-powered scripted browsers, which test login procedures, searches, and other critical business transactions. Monitor your API endpoints with API tests Advanced testing Synthetic monitoring allows you to proactively monitor your website or API endpoint to ensure your content is not only available, but fully functional. Synthetic monitoring browser tests send real, Selenium-powered Google Chrome browsers to your site from locations around the world to ensure your content is always up, everywhere. Scripted browsers expand your testing capabilities, so you can test uncommon user flows or beta-test complex procedures. For example, ensure your users are able to sign up for your newsletter, add an item to their cart, or search for and find a piece of critical content with a simple JavaScript-like language. Test your backend with API monitors, which allow you to run scripted tests against any API endpoint. Enhanced monitoring and reporting Synthetic monitoring aggregates the results of each check into metrics, allowing you to see patterns and identify causes of poor performance. Synthetic monitoring also stores each and every monitor result, so you can see exactly where your website broke down. Alerts notify you if your website or API endpoint is inaccessible. You can even expand your geographical coverage or monitor internal websites by creating private locations. You can also query your monitor results for a closer look. New Relic retains monitor results for thirteen months, ensuring you can compare usage year over year. Additional features Synthetic monitoring includes the following features: Feature Description Real browsers With simple browser and scripted browser monitors, synthetic monitoring doesn't simply check that your host is up. It loads the actual page content in a real, fully virtualized Google Chrome browser (powered by Selenium) to provide testing that mirrors your users' actions. Detailed results view Synthetic monitoring stores every single run of your monitor for 13 months, so you can view a detailed breakdown of each and every check. You can get a snapshot of your website's performance and availability, or hunt down specific problems. Comparative charts with browser monitoring Use New Relic's comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser monitoring) interactions and the synthetic monitors. For example, during a page outage, you can compare trends to see if an issue is also visible in synthetic monitoring, or if it is caused by other variables. Advanced scripted monitoring Use scripted browsers to run complex test cases against your website. Ensure critical processes like checkout and login are always running smoothly, and build a baseline to compare against when things go wrong. With a built-in scripting IDE based on Node.js, create scripts quickly without leaving your browser. Global test coverage Check coverage from locations around the world to ensure your users can access your website from anywhere, anytime. Monitor sites behind your firewall by adding the synthetic monitoring static IP addresses to your allow list. Use private locations to monitor internal sites or to expand your coverage to new locations.

      "body": "New Relic's synthetic monitoring uses monitors distributed throughout data centers around the world. By design, it captures what is essentially performance data for simulated traffic. It does not capture or handle any personal data by default. All data handled by synthetic monitors is expected to be non-personal. This document provides additional details about what we do to ensure data privacy and security with synthetic monitoring, plus additional options you can use. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. What we do Here's a summary of the data privacy and security measures that New Relic provides for you. Data privacy and security Comments No personal data By definition, all data collected through synthetic monitoring is test data created for the purpose of monitoring. None of this data includes personal data from any individual. TLS TLS encryption is required for all domains. This applies to public locations and private locations. Authentication Synthetic monitoring supports a variety of authentication mechanisms, including Basic, Digest, NTLM, and NTLMv2. Available options depend on the type of monitor you choose. Data collection The data transferred to the synthetic endpoint includes: Monitor run results, including full request and response headers of all requests, a complete HAR file of the session, and any screenshots captured (on failure or manually) Polling for available jobs in the private location's queue Private minion \"heartbeat\" every 30 seconds The SyntheticsPrivateMinion event contains basic minion status, including job success and failure counts, queue size, minion version, etc. Data received Data received from the synthetic monitoring endpoint contains the scheduled check's details. This includes the information necessary to complete the check for the minion: Target URL Validation text Full script (for synthetic scripted browser monitors) Data storage location Data collected by synthetic monitoring is stored in the region selected by each customer for their account (US or EU). Monitor configuration details (including frequency, check locations, target URL, and the full script for any scripted browser or API test monitors) are stored on our end. We also store all monitor check results for each monitor type. Data storage by monitor type For ping monitors, data storage includes the HAR file, which includes all requests and responses made during the check. For simple browsers, scripted browsers, and API tests, data storage includes the following: The HAR file includes full request and response headers for all requests made during the check. Any screenshots taken during the check are automatically included for simple and scripted browser monitors only on failure. However, you can manually configure this with scripting. The browser log (JS console) is automatically included for simple and scripted browsers. Any script output is included for scripted browsers and API test monitors. Response bodies New Relic never stores response bodies from requests originated by synthetic monitoring, unless you have manually configured a monitor script to do so. IP addresses Synthetic public minions are expected to be activated using non-personal credentials. Their IP addresses are not defined as personal data under data protection and privacy laws. What you can do For additional levels of security and data privacy, consider using these options. Additional measures Comments User access To control which of your users can access your monitors and private locations, set up role-based synthetic monitoring permissions and user groups. In addition, to track and be notified about changes, use audit logs and alert notifications. Passwords, API keys, user names, etc. To securely store sensitive information, use secured credentials for scripted browsers and API tests. The credentials are securely stored using AES-GCM 256-bit encryption at rest with keys managed by Amazon AWS Key Management Service (KMS). Sites behind firewalls To control what sites you want to monitor behind your firewall, you can: Add the synthetic public minion IP addresses to your allow list or deny list. Use private locations to monitor sites or endpoints. This can provide an extra layer of security when monitoring your internally hosted sites and services. Web pages behind login pages If you configure synthetic monitoring to track website areas that are located behind a login page, be sure to create a non-personal login specifically for this purpose. This unique login will reduce the risk of unintended personal data exposure. Proxy configuration Aside from the target URLs monitored by New Relic, private minions will regularly send data to and receive from the synthetic monitoring endpoint. To configure a proxy for all traffic to and from this endpoint, set the MINION_API_PROXY environment variable on the minion host. Private minions security To ensure that only the scripts you intend to run are allowed to run on private minions, use verified script execution.",

Understand the Summary page Use the Summary page to understand your website's performance: Synthetics Summary charts Description Success and failure rate This shows the monitor's overall success rate and total number of check failed during the given timeframe, the number of locations that are failing, and the error message for the last error detected. The timeframe displayed will vary depending on the frequency of the monitor: 1 minutes = 30 minutes 5 minutes = 1.5 hours 15 minutes = 7.5 hours 30 minutes = 15 hours 1 hour = 30 hours 6 hours = 7.5 days 12 hours = 15 days 24 hours = 30 days Page load time and availability This shows the page load times and availability, the percentage of monitor runs that were successful, for each monitor location. The timeframe displayed will vary depending on the frequency of the monitor: 1 minutes = 30 minutes 5 minutes = 1.5 hours 15 minutes = 7.5 hours 30 minutes = 15 hours 1 hour = 30 hours 6 hours = 7.5 days 12 hours = 15 days 24 hours = 30 days Request/response times This shows the time that it took the ping monitor to send and receive a response, and is broken down into duration sent, duration wait, and duration received. Durations can be displayed as Average, Median, or 95th Percentile. For more information see, Percentiles: Ranking data. This is only available for ping monitor results. Connection times This shows the breakdown for the network connections to be established for this monitor, and is broken down into the DNS, SSL, and connection durations. Duration can be displayed as Average, Median, or 95th Percentile. For more information see, Percentiles: Ranking data. This is only available for ping monitor results. Non-200 response codes This shows any (non-200) error response code that were received as a result of running this monitor. This is only available for ping monitor results. Activity panel Displays any recent activity associated with the monitor, including: Monitor name Number of open violations Activity on the monitor, including recent open and closed violations and audit events. Metadata and tags. Monitored entities: This is any New Relic entity that is observed when this monitor runs and includes the entity alert status. Selecting an entity status will navigate to the monitored entity summary page. Use page functions The Summary page supports the following functions: If you want to... Do this...

Change the time frame Use the time picker to adjust the number of results returned for the following charts: Request/response times Connection times Non-200 response codes This is only available for ping monitor results. Legacy charts Important The following table applies to the old view of the synthetic monitoring summary page. Click Show new view to access a new curated summary experience. Synthetic chart Description Load time chart This shows the load times for each monitor location. When you select a short time frame (such as 30 minutes), Synthetics displays the exact load time for each run of your monitor from each location. With longer time frames, Synthetics adjusts the resolution to show averages. To toggle the visibility of a location, select its label. Availability This shows the percentage of monitor runs that were successful. For a scripted monitor, the entire script must complete for the run to be considered a success. Above the selected monitor's Availability chart, an ellipsis icon appears. Use New Relic's comparative charting feature for a direct page load time comparison between real user (browser monitoring) interactions and the Synthetics monitors. Average load size This chart shows the amount of data (in kilobytes or megabytes) consumed in each run of the monitor. For scripted monitors, the entire script is included in the average load size graph. For example, a monitor that loads three pages will measure the size of all assets on all three pages. If your site is static, the average load size will be very consistent. For dynamic sites such as a news site, the average load size will vary as your page content changes. Slowest results This lists the five slowest results for the selected time frame. To view the performance breakdown, select a result. Monitor downtimes This lists the most recent monitor downtime incidents. To view additional details, select a downtime incident.

SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time.

View the failures page To access your monitor's failures: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > Failures. Hover the mouse over a failure to get quick data about it. Click on the dot to open a detailed report of the failure. You can also click Run check to recheck the failed monitors. View individual downtimes You can select individual downtime incidents to view them in more detail. Depending on the specific failure, a downtime result could include only the server error message (such as Server replied with \"HTTP 500\" error), or a full or partial waterfall view. Downtime results include waterfalls when only part of a monitor executed correctly. For example, a 301 redirect could link to a failing web page. The browser correctly executes the redirect, but the destination web page returns an error. Use the error message or waterfall to troubleshoot the downtime incident. Use page functions The Failures page supports the following features: If you want to... Do this... Sort the list of downtimes In the table header, select Time or Message to sort the list. Select Time or Message again to change from ascending sort to descending sort order. Filter by location Select a location label to hide downtime incidents from that location. Select the location label again to unhide those results. To view results from only one location, hide every other location. Quickly access another monitor At the top of the screen, click on the name of the current monitor to open the dropdown menu. Select from the list of recent monitors, or enter a name in the search field to search for a specific monitor. Change the time frame Use the time picker to adjust the number of downtime incidents returned.

Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution Amazon ECS is not supported. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "In synthetic monitoring, a private location is a collection of private minions. A minion is a containerized application that receives and manages jobs set up through the Synthetics UI. A private location can contain any number of private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your synthetic monitoring coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall (like an intranet site). What you need To use private locations, first review these requirements and other factors: Compatibility for... Requirements Check budget Checks from a private location count against your budget. Synthetics horde endpoint For US-based accounts: https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/ For EU-based accounts: https://synthetics-horde.eu01.nr-data.net/ Outbound network access The minion needs to connect to the synthetic monitoring's horde endpoint to receive and process jobs. If your firewall rules don't permit direct access, you must configure proxy access. Test your connection to the horde endpoint with a successful response from the following command: curl -X GET https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/synthetics/api/v1/ping Copy Account access and permissions How access works depends on your user model: Original user model: If a private location is set up by an account with child accounts, it can be used by users with access to those child accounts. But if it's set up on a child account, it can only be used by users in that account. New Relic One user model: user access to an account depends on whether they've been granted access to that account. Create a private location one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private Locations: Use the Private Locations page to create, edit, and delete private locations. Before installing private minions, you need to create a private location. To create a new private location: Ensure you meet the requirements, including activating the feature by contacting your account representative. Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. Then select Create private location. Tip The Private locations sub menu becomes available after you create your first monitor. Type a location name. Optional: Configure these additional settings: Description: Describe your private location for other account users. Verified script execution: Require a passphrase when assigning scripts to this location, or when adding minions to the location. Select Create. After creating the location, Synthetics lists your Private location key so you can install a private minion. Ping monitor checks Each minion can run about 200 ping monitor checks per minute (about 8,640,000 checks per month). If the job queue for a particular location is growing, add additional minions. The exact capacity of the minions can vary, depending on: Your network performance The complexity of your scripts The hardware configuration for the private minion Add jobs to the location queue To add jobs to the queue for your location, follow standard procedures to add or edit a monitor, and select your location from the Private locations list. To assign an existing monitor, edit that monitor's settings. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: To assign new jobs to your private location and its minions, select its name from the Create monitor page. Manage private locations Tip If you can't access this feature, check the Factors affecting access to features and data. Synthetic monitoring includes tools to manage locations and individual minions. You can also install new minions, and clear the job queue if it backs up. To access these tools, go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. Then follow the steps: If you want to... Do this... Clear the job queue Click the icon, and select Clear queue. This is useful when the number of scheduled jobs has increased faster than the minions can process them, such as when the minion is offline.

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution Amazon ECS is not supported. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "In synthetic monitoring, a private location is a collection of private minions. A minion is a containerized application that receives and manages jobs set up through the Synthetics UI. A private location can contain any number of private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your synthetic monitoring coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall (like an intranet site). What you need To use private locations, first review these requirements and other factors: Compatibility for... Requirements Check budget Checks from a private location count against your budget. Synthetics horde endpoint For US-based accounts: https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/ For EU-based accounts: https://synthetics-horde.eu01.nr-data.net/ Outbound network access The minion needs to connect to the synthetic monitoring's horde endpoint to receive and process jobs. If your firewall rules don't permit direct access, you must configure proxy access. Test your connection to the horde endpoint with a successful response from the following command: curl -X GET https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/synthetics/api/v1/ping Copy Account access and permissions How access works depends on your user model: Original user model: If a private location is set up by an account with child accounts, it can be used by users with access to those child accounts. But if it's set up on a child account, it can only be used by users in that account. New Relic One user model: user access to an account depends on whether they've been granted access to that account. Create a private location one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private Locations: Use the Private Locations page to create, edit, and delete private locations. Before installing private minions, you need to create a private location. To create a new private location: Ensure you meet the requirements, including activating the feature by contacting your account representative. Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. Then select Create private location. Tip The Private locations sub menu becomes available after you create your first monitor. Type a location name. Optional: Configure these additional settings: Description: Describe your private location for other account users. Verified script execution: Require a passphrase when assigning scripts to this location, or when adding minions to the location. Select Create. After creating the location, Synthetics lists your Private location key so you can install a private minion. Ping monitor checks Each minion can run about 200 ping monitor checks per minute (about 8,640,000 checks per month). If the job queue for a particular location is growing, add additional minions. The exact capacity of the minions can vary, depending on: Your network performance The complexity of your scripts The hardware configuration for the private minion Add jobs to the location queue To add jobs to the queue for your location, follow standard procedures to add or edit a monitor, and select your location from the Private locations list. To assign an existing monitor, edit that monitor's settings. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: To assign new jobs to your private location and its minions, select its name from the Create monitor page. Manage private locations Tip If you can't access this feature, check the Factors affecting access to features and data. Synthetic monitoring includes tools to manage locations and individual minions. You can also install new minions, and clear the job queue if it backs up. To access these tools, go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. Then follow the steps: If you want to... Do this... Clear the job queue Click the icon, and select Clear queue. This is useful when the number of scheduled jobs has increased faster than the minions can process them, such as when the minion is offline. View the status of an individual minion Select the parent location's name from the list. The green health status indicator identifies active minions. You can also view the last reported time for each minion, and check whether the minion software is out of date. Change location or view the private location key Click the icon, and select Edit. Delete a location Click the icon for the location, and select Delete. This does not shut down any minions assigned to that location. The minions must be shut down manually or reassigned. Enable or disable verified script execution Legacy minions: Verified script execution requires that you set up a passphrase on the minion before assigning any scripts to the location. CPM: You need to pass the MINION_VSE_PASSPHRASE variable to the minion. Then, at the Private locations tab, click on Edit and, in the menu, enable the Verified script execution option.

      "body": "In synthetic monitoring, a private location is a collection of private minions. A minion is a containerized application that receives and manages jobs set up through the Synthetics UI. A private location can contain any number of private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your synthetic monitoring coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall (like an intranet site). What you need To use private locations, first review these requirements and other factors: Compatibility for... Requirements Check budget Checks from a private location count against your budget. Synthetics horde endpoint For US-based accounts: https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/ For EU-based accounts: https://synthetics-horde.eu01.nr-data.net/ Outbound network access The minion needs to connect to the synthetic monitoring's horde endpoint to receive and process jobs. If your firewall rules don't permit direct access, you must configure proxy access. Test your connection to the horde endpoint with a successful response from the following command: curl -X GET https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/synthetics/api/v1/ping Copy Account access and permissions How access works depends on your user model: Original user model: If a private location is set up by an account with child accounts, it can be used by users with access to those child accounts. But if it's set up on a child account, it can only be used by users in that account. New Relic One user model: user access to an account depends on whether they've been granted access to that account. Create a private location one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private Locations: Use the Private Locations page to create, edit, and delete private locations. Before installing private minions, you need to create a private location. To create a new private location: Ensure you meet the requirements, including activating the feature by contacting your account representative. Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. Then select Create private location. Tip The Private locations sub menu becomes available after you create your first monitor. Type a location name. Optional: Configure these additional settings: Description: Describe your private location for other account users. Verified script execution: Require a passphrase when assigning scripts to this location, or when adding minions to the location. Select Create. After creating the location, Synthetics lists your Private location key so you can install a private minion. Ping monitor checks Each minion can run about 200 ping monitor checks per minute (about 8,640,000 checks per month). If the job queue for a particular location is growing, add additional minions. The exact capacity of the minions can vary, depending on: Your network performance The complexity of your scripts The hardware configuration for the private minion Add jobs to the location queue To add jobs to the queue for your location, follow standard procedures to add or edit a monitor, and select your location from the Private locations list. To assign an existing monitor, edit that monitor's settings. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: To assign new jobs to your private location and its minions, select its name from the Create monitor page. Manage private locations Tip If you can't access this feature, check the Factors affecting access to features and data. Synthetic monitoring includes tools to manage locations and individual minions. You can also install new minions, and clear the job queue if it backs up. To access these tools, go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. Then follow the steps: If you want to... Do this... Clear the job queue Click the icon, and select Clear queue. This is useful when the number of scheduled jobs has increased faster than the minions can process them, such as when the minion is offline. View the status of an individual minion Select the parent location's name from the list. The green health status indicator identifies active minions. You can also view the last reported time for each minion, and check whether the minion software is out of date. Change location or view the private location key Click the icon, and select Edit. Delete a location Click the icon for the location, and select Delete. This does not shut down any minions assigned to that location. The minions must be shut down manually or reassigned. Enable or disable verified script execution Legacy minions: Verified script execution requires that you set up a passphrase on the minion before assigning any scripts to the location. CPM: You need to pass the MINION_VSE_PASSPHRASE variable to the minion. Then, at the Private locations tab, click on Edit and, in the menu, enable the Verified script execution option. Set proxy configuration You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors that run from local private locations. For more information, see Synthetic's proxy settings.",

      "body": "Read on to learn how to configure your containerized private minion (CPM). You can do the following to customize your CPMs: Set up custom modules for scripted browsers in New Relic. Preserve launch data with permanent data storage. Use environment variables in your configuration. You may not modify any CPM files and New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. Guidelines for mounting volumes All directories and files must be assigned group ownership as 3729 with read/write permissions. This ensures that the Runner, which uses uid: 1000 and gid: 3729, has access to all the mounted volumes. However, the Minion is able to run as root (uid: 0) or with any uid between the range of [2000, 4000], inclusive. For more information, see running as non-root in Kubernetes or Docker. Docker Directories are mounted onto a container as volumes by specifying a -v argument within docker run For example, docker run ... -v /path/to/src:/path/to/dest:rw Kubernetes It is possible to add a directory onto a persistent volume (PV) by using kubectl cp. However, alternative approaches are supported as long as the file permissions are set appropriately. For example, kubectl cp /path/to/src <POD_NAME>:/path/to/dest will add a directory onto each PV in the specified pod Each PV must have a separate copy of the directories. For example, a cluster with n Minion replicas must have n PVs, each with their own copy of directories The directories and files must be added prior to the Minion boot up, otherwise the Minion must be restarted to detect the updates Custom npm modules Custom npm modules are exclusive to the CPM. They allow you to provide an arbitrary set of npm modules, and make them available for scripted monitors in Synthetics. To set up the modules: Create a directory which contains a package.json, following the npm official guidelines, in the root of the directory. Anything contained in the dependencies field will be installed by the CPM at start, and made available when running monitors on that private minion. Optionally, you can override the root level package.json with a Node version-specific directory. This allows a script to be updated per monitor runtime if a Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. See an example of this below. Custom module directory In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file Copy The package.json defines dependencies as both a local module (i.e. counter) and an npm hosted modules (i.e. async version ^2.6.1): { \"name\": \"custom-modules\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", ⇦ optional \"description\": \"example custom modules directory\", ⇦ optional \"dependencies\": { \"async\": \"^2.6.1\", ⇦ npm hosted module \"counter\": \"file:./counter\" ⇦ Local module } } Copy Node version-specific overrides You can declare a package.json per Node version that will override the root level package.json. This allows a monitor script to be updated per monitor runtime in the event that the Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. As shown in the first example, local modules can still be defined within a version specific directory. If a package.json is not defined for a specific Node version, then the root level package.json will be used to install dependencies. In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── 6.11.2 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json └── 10.15.0 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file ​ Copy Once you create the custom modules directory and the package.json you can apply it to your CPM for Docker and Kubernetes. Docker For Docker, launch CPM mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules. For example: docker run ... -v /example-custom-modules-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules:rw ... Copy Kubernetes Complete the following: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.customModules configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where your custom modules files exist. For example: helm install ... --set persistence.customModules=<custom-modules-subpath> ... Copy Make sure that your custom modules directory is available on the Minion Pod. You can use kubectl cp as one method to copy the directory from your host to the Minion. For example: kubectl cp /example-custom-modules-dir <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules Copy Look at the CPM logs for \"... Initialization of Custom Modules ...\" to see if the modules were installed properly, or if there were any errors. The npm installation logs will be shown. Now you can add \"require('async');\" into the script of monitors you send to this private location. Change package.json for custom modules Along with npm modules, you can also use Node.js modules. To change the custom modules used by your CPM, modify package.json and reboot the CPM. It will detect the change in configuration during the reboot, and then clean up and re-install. Caution Local modules: While your package.json can include any local module, these modules must reside inside the tree under your custom module directory. If stored outside the tree, the initialization process will fail and you will see an error message in the docker logs after launching CPM. Permanent data storage CPM is a stateless application and does not preserve information from prior requests or sessions by default. However, you can preserve data between launches by enabling permanent data storage. For example, you can permanently set how the minion identifies itself (for example, Minion_ID), and use it to associate the data visible in Synthetics and Insights events with the exact minion that produced it. To set permanent data storage on Docker: Create a directory. Launch the CPM, mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics. Example: docker run ... -v /example-permanent-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics:rw ... Copy To set permanent data storage on Kubernetes: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.permanentData configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where you want the data to be saved. Example: helm install ... --set persistence.permanentData=<permanent-data-subpath> ... Copy User-defined environment variables for scripted monitors Containerized private minions let you configure environment variables for use in scripted monitors. These variables are hosted locally on the CPM and can be accessed via $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES. There are two ways to set user-defined variables: by mounting a JSON file or by supplying an environment variable to the CPM on launch. If both are provided, the CPM will use values provided from the environment only. Mounting JSON file The JSON file must have read permissions and contain a JSON formatted map. Example user-defined variable file: { \"KEY\" : \"VALUE\", \"User_Name\": \"MINION\", \"My_Password\": \"PASSW0RD 1 2 3\", \"my_URL\": \"https://newrelic.com/\", \"ETC\" : \"ETC\" } Copy The file must be available or mounted to the path in your container: /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Docker example: docker run ... -v /example-user-defined-variables.json:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json:rw ... Copy Kubernetes example: When mounting a JSON file to your Minion Pod in Kubernetes, you can either copy the file directly to the Minion Pod or to a Pod that has access to the same Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim that the Minion will use. After successfully loading the file, you may need to restart your Minion Pod for the change to take effect. kubectl cp path/to/user_defined_variables.json <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Copy Passing as an environment variable Use the -e flag to set up an environment variable named MINION_USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES and give it a value of a JSON formatted map string. docker run ... -e MINION_USER_DEFINED_ENV_VARIABLES='{\"KEY\":\"VALUE\",\"NAME\":\"MINION\",\"ETC\":\"ETC\"}' ... Copy Tip The CPM on Kubernetes does not currently support loading user-defined environment variables via environment variable. You will have to configure your Kubernetes CPM by mounting a JSON file. Accessing user-defined environment variables from scripts To reference a configured user-defined environment variable, use the reserved $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES followed by the name of a given variable with dot notation. For example, $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES.MY_VARIABLE Caution User-defined environment variables are not sanitized from logs. For sensitive information, consider using the secure credentials feature. Environment variables Environmental variables allow you to fine-tune the CPM configuration to meet your specific environmental and functional needs.

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution Amazon ECS is not supported. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "In synthetic monitoring, a private location is a collection of private minions. A minion is a containerized application that receives and manages jobs set up through the Synthetics UI. A private location can contain any number of private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your synthetic monitoring coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall (like an intranet site). What you need To use private locations, first review these requirements and other factors: Compatibility for... Requirements Check budget Checks from a private location count against your budget. Synthetics horde endpoint For US-based accounts: https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/ For EU-based accounts: https://synthetics-horde.eu01.nr-data.net/ Outbound network access The minion needs to connect to the synthetic monitoring's horde endpoint to receive and process jobs. If your firewall rules don't permit direct access, you must configure proxy access. Test your connection to the horde endpoint with a successful response from the following command: curl -X GET https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/synthetics/api/v1/ping Copy Account access and permissions How access works depends on your user model: Original user model: If a private location is set up by an account with child accounts, it can be used by users with access to those child accounts. But if it's set up on a child account, it can only be used by users in that account. New Relic One user model: user access to an account depends on whether they've been granted access to that account. Create a private location one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private Locations: Use the Private Locations page to create, edit, and delete private locations. Before installing private minions, you need to create a private location. To create a new private location: Ensure you meet the requirements, including activating the feature by contacting your account representative. Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. Then select Create private location. Tip The Private locations sub menu becomes available after you create your first monitor. Type a location name. Optional: Configure these additional settings: Description: Describe your private location for other account users. Verified script execution: Require a passphrase when assigning scripts to this location, or when adding minions to the location. Select Create. After creating the location, Synthetics lists your Private location key so you can install a private minion. Ping monitor checks Each minion can run about 200 ping monitor checks per minute (about 8,640,000 checks per month). If the job queue for a particular location is growing, add additional minions. The exact capacity of the minions can vary, depending on: Your network performance The complexity of your scripts The hardware configuration for the private minion Add jobs to the location queue To add jobs to the queue for your location, follow standard procedures to add or edit a monitor, and select your location from the Private locations list. To assign an existing monitor, edit that monitor's settings. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: To assign new jobs to your private location and its minions, select its name from the Create monitor page. Manage private locations Tip If you can't access this feature, check the Factors affecting access to features and data. Synthetic monitoring includes tools to manage locations and individual minions. You can also install new minions, and clear the job queue if it backs up. To access these tools, go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. Then follow the steps: If you want to... Do this... Clear the job queue Click the icon, and select Clear queue. This is useful when the number of scheduled jobs has increased faster than the minions can process them, such as when the minion is offline. View the status of an individual minion Select the parent location's name from the list. The green health status indicator identifies active minions. You can also view the last reported time for each minion, and check whether the minion software is out of date. Change location or view the private location key Click the icon, and select Edit. Delete a location Click the icon for the location, and select Delete. This does not shut down any minions assigned to that location. The minions must be shut down manually or reassigned. Enable or disable verified script execution Legacy minions: Verified script execution requires that you set up a passphrase on the minion before assigning any scripts to the location. CPM: You need to pass the MINION_VSE_PASSPHRASE variable to the minion. Then, at the Private locations tab, click on Edit and, in the menu, enable the Verified script execution option. Set proxy configuration You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors that run from local private locations. For more information, see Synthetic's proxy settings.",

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution Amazon ECS is not supported. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "Read on to learn how to configure your containerized private minion (CPM). You can do the following to customize your CPMs: Set up custom modules for scripted browsers in New Relic. Preserve launch data with permanent data storage. Use environment variables in your configuration. You may not modify any CPM files and New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. Guidelines for mounting volumes All directories and files must be assigned group ownership as 3729 with read/write permissions. This ensures that the Runner, which uses uid: 1000 and gid: 3729, has access to all the mounted volumes. However, the Minion is able to run as root (uid: 0) or with any uid between the range of [2000, 4000], inclusive. For more information, see running as non-root in Kubernetes or Docker. Docker Directories are mounted onto a container as volumes by specifying a -v argument within docker run For example, docker run ... -v /path/to/src:/path/to/dest:rw Kubernetes It is possible to add a directory onto a persistent volume (PV) by using kubectl cp. However, alternative approaches are supported as long as the file permissions are set appropriately. For example, kubectl cp /path/to/src <POD_NAME>:/path/to/dest will add a directory onto each PV in the specified pod Each PV must have a separate copy of the directories. For example, a cluster with n Minion replicas must have n PVs, each with their own copy of directories The directories and files must be added prior to the Minion boot up, otherwise the Minion must be restarted to detect the updates Custom npm modules Custom npm modules are exclusive to the CPM. They allow you to provide an arbitrary set of npm modules, and make them available for scripted monitors in Synthetics. To set up the modules: Create a directory which contains a package.json, following the npm official guidelines, in the root of the directory. Anything contained in the dependencies field will be installed by the CPM at start, and made available when running monitors on that private minion. Optionally, you can override the root level package.json with a Node version-specific directory. This allows a script to be updated per monitor runtime if a Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. See an example of this below. Custom module directory In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file Copy The package.json defines dependencies as both a local module (i.e. counter) and an npm hosted modules (i.e. async version ^2.6.1): { \"name\": \"custom-modules\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", ⇦ optional \"description\": \"example custom modules directory\", ⇦ optional \"dependencies\": { \"async\": \"^2.6.1\", ⇦ npm hosted module \"counter\": \"file:./counter\" ⇦ Local module } } Copy Node version-specific overrides You can declare a package.json per Node version that will override the root level package.json. This allows a monitor script to be updated per monitor runtime in the event that the Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. As shown in the first example, local modules can still be defined within a version specific directory. If a package.json is not defined for a specific Node version, then the root level package.json will be used to install dependencies. In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── 6.11.2 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json └── 10.15.0 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file ​ Copy Once you create the custom modules directory and the package.json you can apply it to your CPM for Docker and Kubernetes. Docker For Docker, launch CPM mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules. For example: docker run ... -v /example-custom-modules-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules:rw ... Copy Kubernetes Complete the following: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.customModules configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where your custom modules files exist. For example: helm install ... --set persistence.customModules=<custom-modules-subpath> ... Copy Make sure that your custom modules directory is available on the Minion Pod. You can use kubectl cp as one method to copy the directory from your host to the Minion. For example: kubectl cp /example-custom-modules-dir <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules Copy Look at the CPM logs for \"... Initialization of Custom Modules ...\" to see if the modules were installed properly, or if there were any errors. The npm installation logs will be shown. Now you can add \"require('async');\" into the script of monitors you send to this private location. Change package.json for custom modules Along with npm modules, you can also use Node.js modules. To change the custom modules used by your CPM, modify package.json and reboot the CPM. It will detect the change in configuration during the reboot, and then clean up and re-install. Caution Local modules: While your package.json can include any local module, these modules must reside inside the tree under your custom module directory. If stored outside the tree, the initialization process will fail and you will see an error message in the docker logs after launching CPM. Permanent data storage CPM is a stateless application and does not preserve information from prior requests or sessions by default. However, you can preserve data between launches by enabling permanent data storage. For example, you can permanently set how the minion identifies itself (for example, Minion_ID), and use it to associate the data visible in Synthetics and Insights events with the exact minion that produced it. To set permanent data storage on Docker: Create a directory. Launch the CPM, mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics. Example: docker run ... -v /example-permanent-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics:rw ... Copy To set permanent data storage on Kubernetes: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.permanentData configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where you want the data to be saved. Example: helm install ... --set persistence.permanentData=<permanent-data-subpath> ... Copy User-defined environment variables for scripted monitors Containerized private minions let you configure environment variables for use in scripted monitors. These variables are hosted locally on the CPM and can be accessed via $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES. There are two ways to set user-defined variables: by mounting a JSON file or by supplying an environment variable to the CPM on launch. If both are provided, the CPM will use values provided from the environment only. Mounting JSON file The JSON file must have read permissions and contain a JSON formatted map. Example user-defined variable file: { \"KEY\" : \"VALUE\", \"User_Name\": \"MINION\", \"My_Password\": \"PASSW0RD 1 2 3\", \"my_URL\": \"https://newrelic.com/\", \"ETC\" : \"ETC\" } Copy The file must be available or mounted to the path in your container: /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Docker example: docker run ... -v /example-user-defined-variables.json:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json:rw ... Copy Kubernetes example: When mounting a JSON file to your Minion Pod in Kubernetes, you can either copy the file directly to the Minion Pod or to a Pod that has access to the same Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim that the Minion will use. After successfully loading the file, you may need to restart your Minion Pod for the change to take effect. kubectl cp path/to/user_defined_variables.json <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Copy Passing as an environment variable Use the -e flag to set up an environment variable named MINION_USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES and give it a value of a JSON formatted map string. docker run ... -e MINION_USER_DEFINED_ENV_VARIABLES='{\"KEY\":\"VALUE\",\"NAME\":\"MINION\",\"ETC\":\"ETC\"}' ... Copy Tip The CPM on Kubernetes does not currently support loading user-defined environment variables via environment variable. You will have to configure your Kubernetes CPM by mounting a JSON file. Accessing user-defined environment variables from scripts To reference a configured user-defined environment variable, use the reserved $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES followed by the name of a given variable with dot notation. For example, $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES.MY_VARIABLE Caution User-defined environment variables are not sanitized from logs. For sensitive information, consider using the secure credentials feature. Environment variables Environmental variables allow you to fine-tune the CPM configuration to meet your specific environmental and functional needs.

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution Amazon ECS is not supported. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "In synthetic monitoring, a private location is a collection of private minions. A minion is a containerized application that receives and manages jobs set up through the Synthetics UI. A private location can contain any number of private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your synthetic monitoring coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall (like an intranet site). What you need To use private locations, first review these requirements and other factors: Compatibility for... Requirements Check budget Checks from a private location count against your budget. Synthetics horde endpoint For US-based accounts: https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/ For EU-based accounts: https://synthetics-horde.eu01.nr-data.net/ Outbound network access The minion needs to connect to the synthetic monitoring's horde endpoint to receive and process jobs. If your firewall rules don't permit direct access, you must configure proxy access. Test your connection to the horde endpoint with a successful response from the following command: curl -X GET https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/synthetics/api/v1/ping Copy Account access and permissions How access works depends on your user model: Original user model: If a private location is set up by an account with child accounts, it can be used by users with access to those child accounts. But if it's set up on a child account, it can only be used by users in that account. New Relic One user model: user access to an account depends on whether they've been granted access to that account. Create a private location one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private Locations: Use the Private Locations page to create, edit, and delete private locations. Before installing private minions, you need to create a private location. To create a new private location: Ensure you meet the requirements, including activating the feature by contacting your account representative. Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. Then select Create private location. Tip The Private locations sub menu becomes available after you create your first monitor. Type a location name. Optional: Configure these additional settings: Description: Describe your private location for other account users. Verified script execution: Require a passphrase when assigning scripts to this location, or when adding minions to the location. Select Create. After creating the location, Synthetics lists your Private location key so you can install a private minion. Ping monitor checks Each minion can run about 200 ping monitor checks per minute (about 8,640,000 checks per month). If the job queue for a particular location is growing, add additional minions. The exact capacity of the minions can vary, depending on: Your network performance The complexity of your scripts The hardware configuration for the private minion Add jobs to the location queue To add jobs to the queue for your location, follow standard procedures to add or edit a monitor, and select your location from the Private locations list. To assign an existing monitor, edit that monitor's settings. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: To assign new jobs to your private location and its minions, select its name from the Create monitor page. Manage private locations Tip If you can't access this feature, check the Factors affecting access to features and data. Synthetic monitoring includes tools to manage locations and individual minions. You can also install new minions, and clear the job queue if it backs up. To access these tools, go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. Then follow the steps: If you want to... Do this... Clear the job queue Click the icon, and select Clear queue. This is useful when the number of scheduled jobs has increased faster than the minions can process them, such as when the minion is offline. View the status of an individual minion Select the parent location's name from the list. The green health status indicator identifies active minions. You can also view the last reported time for each minion, and check whether the minion software is out of date. Change location or view the private location key Click the icon, and select Edit. Delete a location Click the icon for the location, and select Delete. This does not shut down any minions assigned to that location. The minions must be shut down manually or reassigned. Enable or disable verified script execution Legacy minions: Verified script execution requires that you set up a passphrase on the minion before assigning any scripts to the location. CPM: You need to pass the MINION_VSE_PASSPHRASE variable to the minion. Then, at the Private locations tab, click on Edit and, in the menu, enable the Verified script execution option.

      "body": "You can use New Relic's containerized private minions (CPM). These are Docker container-based private minions that accept and execute synthetic monitors against your private locations. The CPM can operate in a Docker container system environment or a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM will auto-detect its environment to select the appropriate operating mode. General private minion features Because the CPM operates as a container instead of a virtual machine, it delivers many features: Easy to install, start, and update Runs on: Linux macOS Windows Enhanced security and support for non-root user execution Ability to leverage a Docker container as a sandbox environment Customizable monitor check timeout Custom provided modules for scripted monitor types Kubernetes-specific features Also, the CPM delivers the following features in a Kubernetes environment: Integrates with the Kubernetes API to delegate runtime lifecycle management to Kubernetes Does not require privileged access to the Docker socket Supports hosted and on-premise Kubernetes clusters Supports various container engines such as Docker and Containerd Deployable via Helm charts as well as configuration YAMLs Allows job (ping vs. non-ping checks) based resource allocation for optimum resource management Observability offered via the New Relic One Kubernetes cluster explorer System requirements and compatibility To host CPMs, your system must meet the minimum requirements for the chosen system environment. Caution Do not modify any CPM files. New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. For more information, contact your account representative or a New Relic technical sales rep. Docker container system environment requirements Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Memory 2.5 GiB of RAM per CPU core (dedicated) Disk space A minimum of 10 GB per host Docker version Docker 17.12.1-ce or higher Private location key You must have a private location key Caution Amazon ECS is not supported. Kubernetes container orchestration system environment requirements (CPM v3.0.0 or higher) Compatibility for Requirements Operating system Linux kernel: 3.10 or higher macOS: 10.11 or higher Windows: Windows 10 64-bit or higher Processor A modern, multi-core CPU Minion pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 0.75 Memory: 800 Mi up to 1.6 Gi Resources allocated to a Minion pod are user configurable. Runner pod CPU (vCPU/Core): 0.5 up to 1 Memory: 1.25 Gi up to 3 Gi For a scripted API check, 1.25 Gi will be requested with a limit of 2.5 Gi. For a simple browser or scripted browser check, 2 Gi will be requested with a limit of 3 Gi. Additional considerations: Resources allocated to a runner pod are not user configurable. The maximum limit-request resource ratio for both CPU and memory is 2. Disk space Persistent volume (PV) of at least 10 Gi in size Note that if a ReadWriteOnce (RWO) PV is provided to the minion, an implicit node affinity will be established to ensure the minion and the runner containers are scheduled on the same node. This is required to allow the minion and the associated runners access to the PV, as an RWO PV can be accessed only by a single node in the cluster. Kubernetes version We recommend that your Kubernetes cluster supports Kubernetes v1.15. Caution We have identified a compatibility issue with Kubernetes v1.21+. A workaround is available by disabling the BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume feature gate on the cluster. Private location key You must have a private location key Helm Follow installation instructions for Helm v3 for your OS. Kubectl Follow installation instructions for Kubectl for your OS. To view versions, dependencies, default values for how many runner pods start with each minion, the Persistent volume access mode, and more, please see Show help and examples below. Private location key Before launching CPMs, you must have a private location key. Your CPM uses the key to authenticate against New Relic and run monitors associated with that private location. To find the key for existing private location: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. In the Private locations index, locate the private location you want your CPM to be assigned to. Note the key associated with the private location with the key icon. Sandboxing and Docker dependencies Sandboxing and Docker dependencies are applicable to the CPM in a Docker container system environment. Docker dependencies The CPM runs in Docker and is able to leverage Docker as a sandboxing technology. This ensures complete isolation of the monitor execution, which improves security, reliability, and repeatability. Every time a scripted or browser monitor is executed, the CPM creates a brand new Docker container to run it in called a runner. The minion container needs to be configured to communicate with the Docker engine in order to spawn additional runner containers. Each spawned container is then dedicated to run a check associated with the synthetic monitor running on the private location the minion container is associated with. There are two crucial dependencies at launch. To enable sandboxing, ensure that: Your writable and executable directory is mounted at /tmp. The writable directory can be any directory you want the CPM to write into, but New Relic recommends the system's own /tmp to make things easy. Your writable Docker UNIX socket is mounted at /var/run/docker.sock or DOCKER_HOST environment variable. For more information, see Docker's Daemon socket option. Caution Core count on the host determines how many runner containers the CPM can run concurrently on the host. Since memory requirements are scaled to the expected count of runner containers, we recommend not running multiple CPMs on the same host to avoid resource contention. For additional information on sandboxing and running as a root or non-root user, see Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root. Install and update CPM versions Both installing and updating the CPM use the same command to pull the latest Docker image from the Quay.io repository where the CPM Docker image is hosted. Go to quay.io/repository/newrelic/synthetics-minion for a list of all the releases. CPM images are also hosted on Docker Hub. Go to hub.docker.com/r/newrelic/synthetics-minion/tags for a list of all the releases. Start the CPM To start the CPM, follow the applicable Docker or Kubernetes instructions. Docker start procedure Locate your private location key. Ensure you've enabled Docker dependencies for sandboxing and installed CPM on your system. Run the appropriate script for your system. Tailor the common defaults for /tmp and /var/run/docker.sock in the following examples to match your system. Linux/macOS: docker run \\ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME \\ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" \\ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw \\ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \\ -d \\ --restart unless-stopped \\ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy Windows: docker run ^ --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME ^ -e \"MINION_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY\" ^ -v /tmp:/tmp:rw ^ -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw ^ -d ^ --restart unless-stopped ^ quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest Copy View the logs for your minion container: docker logs --follow YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy When a message similar to Synthetics Minion is ready and servicing location YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_LABEL appears, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to that location. Kubernetes start procedure Locate your private location key. Set up the a namespace for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl create namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Copy the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo. If you are copying the charts for the first time: helm repo add YOUR_REPO_NAME https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy If you previously copied the Helm charts from the New Relic Helm repo, then get the latest: helm repo update Copy Install the CPM with the following Helm command: For a fresh installation of the CPM: helm install YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy To update an existing CPM installation: helm upgrade YOUR_CPM_NAME YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion -n YOUR_NAMESPACE --set synthetics.privateLocationKey=YOUR_PRIVATE_LOCATION_KEY Copy Check if the minion pod is up and running: kubectl get -n YOUR_NAMESPACE pods Copy Once the status attribute of each pod is shown as running, your CPM is up and ready to run monitors assigned to your private location. Stop or delete the CPM On a Docker container system environment, use the Docker stop procedure to stop the CPM from running. On a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, use the Kubernetes delete procedure to stop the CPM from running. Docker stop procedure You can stop a Docker container either by the container name, or the container ID. Container name stop for Linux, macOS, and Windows: docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME Copy Container ID stop for Linux/macOS: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. CONTAINER_ID=$(docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME) docker stop $CONTAINER_ID docker rm $CONTAINER_ID Copy Container ID stop for Windows: In the examples the container is stopped and removed. To only stop the container, omit docker rm $CONTAINER_ID. FOR /F \"tokens=*\" %%CID IN ('docker ps -aqf name=YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME') do (SET CONTAINER_ID=%%CID) docker stop %CONTAINER_ID% docker rm %CONTAINER_ID% Copy Kubernetes delete procedure Get the MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME of the minion pod you want to delete: helm list -n YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Delete the minion pod: helm uninstall -n YOUR_NAMESPACE MINION_POD_INSTALLATION_NAME Copy Delete the namespace set up for the CPM in your Kubernetes cluster: kubectl delete namespace YOUR_NAMESPACE Copy Show help and examples Use these options as applicable: To get a list of the most commonly used run options directly in the command line interface, run the show help command. To show CPM usage examples as well as the list of all the available run options, run this command: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest help Copy To keep track of Docker logs and verify the health of your monitors, see Containerized private minion (CPM) maintenance and monitoring. For a CPM in the Kubernetes container orchestration system environment, the following Helm show commands can be used to view the chart.yaml and the values.yaml, respectively: helm show chart YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy helm show values YOUR_REPO_NAME/synthetics-minion Copy Show license information To show the licensing information for the open source software that we use in the CPM, run the LICENSE command. Run this command to view license information for CPM versions 2.2.27 or higher: docker run quay.io/newrelic/synthetics-minion:latest LICENSE Copy Some of our open-source software is listed under multiple software licenses, and in that case we have listed the license we've chosen to use. Our license information is also available in the our licenses documentation. Configure CPM You can configure the containerized private minion with custom npm modules, preserve data between launches, use environment variables, and more. For more information, see CPM configuration. Networks For both Docker and Kubernetes, the CPM and its runner containers will inherit network settings from the host. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. A new bridge network is created for each runner container. This means networking command options like --network and --dns passed to the CPM container at launch (such as through Docker run commands on a Docker container system environment) are not inherited or used by the runner containers. When these networks are created, they pull from the default IP address pool configured for daemon. For an example of this on a Docker container system environment, see the Docker site. Typically, the runner network is removed after the check is completed. However, if a CPM exits while a check is still running, or exits in another unexpected circumstance, these networks may get orphaned. This can potentially use up IP address space that is available to the Docker daemon. If this happens, you may see INTERNAL ENGINE ERROR code: 31 entries in your CPM logging when trying to create a new runner container. To clean these up in Docker container system environments only, run docker network prune. Security, sandboxing, and running as non-root By default, the software running inside a CPM is executed with root user privileges. This is suitable for most scenarios, as the execution is sandboxed. In a Docker container system environment: To change the default AppArmor profile used by containers that CPM spawns to run monitors, see the environment variable MINION_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version 3.0.3 or higher) or MINION_DOCKER_RUNNER_APPARMOR (CPM version up to v3.0.2). To run the CPM as a non-root user, additional steps are required: Run as non-root user for Docker For more information, see Docker's official documentation about security and AppArmor security profiles. If your environment requires you to run the CPM as a non-root user, follow this procedure. In the following example, the non-root user is my_user. Ensure that my_user can use the Docker engine on the host: Verify that my_user belongs to the \"docker\" system group. OR Enable the Docker TCP socket option, and pass the DOCKER_HOST environment variable to CPM. Verify that my_user has read/write permissions to all the directories and volumes passed to CPM. To set these permission, use the chmod command. Get the uid of my_user for use in the run command: id -u my_user. Once these conditions are met, use the option \"-u <uid>:<gid>\" when launching CPM: docker run ... -u 1002 ... Copy OR docker run ... -u 1002 -e DOCKER_HOST=http://localhost:2375 ... Copy Docker image repository A single CPM Docker image serves both the Docker container system environment and Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The Docker image is hosted on quay.io. To make sure your Docker image is up-to-date, see the quay.io newrelic/synthetics-minion repository. Additional considerations for CPM connection Connection Description CPMs without Internet access A CPM can operate without access to the internet, but with some exceptions. The public internet health check can be disabled using the environment variables named MINION_NETWORK_HEALTHCHECK_DISABLED for a Docker container system environment or synthetics.minionNetworkHealthCheckDisabled for a Kubernetes container orchestration system environment. The CPM needs to be able to contact the \"synthetics-horde.nr-data.net\" domain. This is necessary for it to report data to New Relic and to receive monitors to execute. Ask your network administration if this is a problem and how to set up exceptions. Communicate with Synthetics via a proxy To set up communication with New Relic by proxy, use the environment variables named MINION_API_PROXY*. Arguments passed at launch This applies to a Docker container environment only. Arguments passed to the CPM container at launch do not get passed on to the containers spawned by the CPM. Docker has no concept of \"inheritance\" or a \"hierarchy\" of containers, and we don't copy the configuration that is passed from CPM to the monitor-running containers. The only shared configuration between them is the one set at the Docker daemon level.",

      "body": "In synthetic monitoring, a private location is a collection of private minions. A minion is a containerized application that receives and manages jobs set up through the Synthetics UI. A private location can contain any number of private minions. Private locations allow you to extend your synthetic monitoring coverage to new geographical locations, and to monitor websites behind your firewall (like an intranet site). What you need To use private locations, first review these requirements and other factors: Compatibility for... Requirements Check budget Checks from a private location count against your budget. Synthetics horde endpoint For US-based accounts: https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/ For EU-based accounts: https://synthetics-horde.eu01.nr-data.net/ Outbound network access The minion needs to connect to the synthetic monitoring's horde endpoint to receive and process jobs. If your firewall rules don't permit direct access, you must configure proxy access. Test your connection to the horde endpoint with a successful response from the following command: curl -X GET https://synthetics-horde.nr-data.net/synthetics/api/v1/ping Copy Account access and permissions How access works depends on your user model: Original user model: If a private location is set up by an account with child accounts, it can be used by users with access to those child accounts. But if it's set up on a child account, it can only be used by users in that account. New Relic One user model: user access to an account depends on whether they've been granted access to that account. Create a private location one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private Locations: Use the Private Locations page to create, edit, and delete private locations. Before installing private minions, you need to create a private location. To create a new private location: Ensure you meet the requirements, including activating the feature by contacting your account representative. Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. Then select Create private location. Tip The Private locations sub menu becomes available after you create your first monitor. Type a location name. Optional: Configure these additional settings: Description: Describe your private location for other account users. Verified script execution: Require a passphrase when assigning scripts to this location, or when adding minions to the location. Select Create. After creating the location, Synthetics lists your Private location key so you can install a private minion. Ping monitor checks Each minion can run about 200 ping monitor checks per minute (about 8,640,000 checks per month). If the job queue for a particular location is growing, add additional minions. The exact capacity of the minions can vary, depending on: Your network performance The complexity of your scripts The hardware configuration for the private minion Add jobs to the location queue To add jobs to the queue for your location, follow standard procedures to add or edit a monitor, and select your location from the Private locations list. To assign an existing monitor, edit that monitor's settings. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: To assign new jobs to your private location and its minions, select its name from the Create monitor page. Manage private locations Tip If you can't access this feature, check the Factors affecting access to features and data. Synthetic monitoring includes tools to manage locations and individual minions. You can also install new minions, and clear the job queue if it backs up. To access these tools, go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Private locations. Then follow the steps: If you want to... Do this... Clear the job queue Click the icon, and select Clear queue. This is useful when the number of scheduled jobs has increased faster than the minions can process them, such as when the minion is offline. View the status of an individual minion Select the parent location's name from the list. The green health status indicator identifies active minions. You can also view the last reported time for each minion, and check whether the minion software is out of date. Change location or view the private location key Click the icon, and select Edit. Delete a location Click the icon for the location, and select Delete. This does not shut down any minions assigned to that location. The minions must be shut down manually or reassigned. Enable or disable verified script execution Legacy minions: Verified script execution requires that you set up a passphrase on the minion before assigning any scripts to the location.

      "body": "Read on to learn how to configure your containerized private minion (CPM). You can do the following to customize your CPMs: Set up custom modules for scripted browsers in New Relic. Preserve launch data with permanent data storage. Use environment variables in your configuration. You may not modify any CPM files and New Relic is not liable for any modifications you make. Guidelines for mounting volumes All directories and files must be assigned group ownership as 3729 with read/write permissions. This ensures that the Runner, which uses uid: 1000 and gid: 3729, has access to all the mounted volumes. However, the Minion is able to run as root (uid: 0) or with any uid between the range of [2000, 4000], inclusive. For more information, see running as non-root in Kubernetes or Docker. Docker Directories are mounted onto a container as volumes by specifying a -v argument within docker run For example, docker run ... -v /path/to/src:/path/to/dest:rw Kubernetes It is possible to add a directory onto a persistent volume (PV) by using kubectl cp. However, alternative approaches are supported as long as the file permissions are set appropriately. For example, kubectl cp /path/to/src <POD_NAME>:/path/to/dest will add a directory onto each PV in the specified pod Each PV must have a separate copy of the directories. For example, a cluster with n Minion replicas must have n PVs, each with their own copy of directories The directories and files must be added prior to the Minion boot up, otherwise the Minion must be restarted to detect the updates Custom npm modules Custom npm modules are exclusive to the CPM. They allow you to provide an arbitrary set of npm modules, and make them available for scripted monitors in Synthetics. To set up the modules: Create a directory which contains a package.json, following the npm official guidelines, in the root of the directory. Anything contained in the dependencies field will be installed by the CPM at start, and made available when running monitors on that private minion. Optionally, you can override the root level package.json with a Node version-specific directory. This allows a script to be updated per monitor runtime if a Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. See an example of this below. Custom module directory In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file Copy The package.json defines dependencies as both a local module (i.e. counter) and an npm hosted modules (i.e. async version ^2.6.1): { \"name\": \"custom-modules\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", ⇦ optional \"description\": \"example custom modules directory\", ⇦ optional \"dependencies\": { \"async\": \"^2.6.1\", ⇦ npm hosted module \"counter\": \"file:./counter\" ⇦ Local module } } Copy Node version-specific overrides You can declare a package.json per Node version that will override the root level package.json. This allows a monitor script to be updated per monitor runtime in the event that the Node version of a runtime is no longer compatible with your dependencies. As shown in the first example, local modules can still be defined within a version specific directory. If a package.json is not defined for a specific Node version, then the root level package.json will be used to install dependencies. In this example, a custom module directory is used with the following structure: /example-custom-modules-dir/ ├── 6.11.2 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json └── 10.15.0 ⇦ optional Node specific directory │ └── package.json ├── counter │ ├── index.js │ └── package.json └── package.json ⇦ the only mandatory file ​ Copy Once you create the custom modules directory and the package.json you can apply it to your CPM for Docker and Kubernetes. Docker For Docker, launch CPM mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules. For example: docker run ... -v /example-custom-modules-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules:rw ... Copy Kubernetes Complete the following: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.customModules configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where your custom modules files exist. For example: helm install ... --set persistence.customModules=<custom-modules-subpath> ... Copy Make sure that your custom modules directory is available on the Minion Pod. You can use kubectl cp as one method to copy the directory from your host to the Minion. For example: kubectl cp /example-custom-modules-dir <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/modules Copy Look at the CPM logs for \"... Initialization of Custom Modules ...\" to see if the modules were installed properly, or if there were any errors. The npm installation logs will be shown. Now you can add \"require('async');\" into the script of monitors you send to this private location. Change package.json for custom modules Along with npm modules, you can also use Node.js modules. To change the custom modules used by your CPM, modify package.json and reboot the CPM. It will detect the change in configuration during the reboot, and then clean up and re-install. Caution Local modules: While your package.json can include any local module, these modules must reside inside the tree under your custom module directory. If stored outside the tree, the initialization process will fail and you will see an error message in the docker logs after launching CPM. Permanent data storage CPM is a stateless application and does not preserve information from prior requests or sessions by default. However, you can preserve data between launches by enabling permanent data storage. For example, you can permanently set how the minion identifies itself (for example, Minion_ID), and use it to associate the data visible in Synthetics and Insights events with the exact minion that produced it. To set permanent data storage on Docker: Create a directory. Launch the CPM, mounting the directory at /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics. Example: docker run ... -v /example-permanent-dir:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics:rw ... Copy To set permanent data storage on Kubernetes: Launch the CPM, setting a value for the persistence.permanentData configuration value either in the command line or in a YAML file during installation. The value should specify the subpath on your Minion's Persistent Volume where you want the data to be saved. Example: helm install ... --set persistence.permanentData=<permanent-data-subpath> ... Copy User-defined environment variables for scripted monitors Containerized private minions let you configure environment variables for use in scripted monitors. These variables are hosted locally on the CPM and can be accessed via $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES. There are two ways to set user-defined variables: by mounting a JSON file or by supplying an environment variable to the CPM on launch. If both are provided, the CPM will use values provided from the environment only. Mounting JSON file The JSON file must have read permissions and contain a JSON formatted map. Example user-defined variable file: { \"KEY\" : \"VALUE\", \"User_Name\": \"MINION\", \"My_Password\": \"PASSW0RD 1 2 3\", \"my_URL\": \"https://newrelic.com/\", \"ETC\" : \"ETC\" } Copy The file must be available or mounted to the path in your container: /var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Docker example: docker run ... -v /example-user-defined-variables.json:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json:rw ... Copy Kubernetes example: When mounting a JSON file to your Minion Pod in Kubernetes, you can either copy the file directly to the Minion Pod or to a Pod that has access to the same Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim that the Minion will use. After successfully loading the file, you may need to restart your Minion Pod for the change to take effect. kubectl cp path/to/user_defined_variables.json <namespace>/<pod_name>:/var/lib/newrelic/synthetics/variables/user_defined_variables.json Copy Passing as an environment variable Use the -e flag to set up an environment variable named MINION_USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES and give it a value of a JSON formatted map string. docker run ... -e MINION_USER_DEFINED_ENV_VARIABLES='{\"KEY\":\"VALUE\",\"NAME\":\"MINION\",\"ETC\":\"ETC\"}' ... Copy Tip The CPM on Kubernetes does not currently support loading user-defined environment variables via environment variable. You will have to configure your Kubernetes CPM by mounting a JSON file. Accessing user-defined environment variables from scripts To reference a configured user-defined environment variable, use the reserved $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES followed by the name of a given variable with dot notation. For example, $env.USER_DEFINED_VARIABLES.MY_VARIABLE Caution User-defined environment variables are not sanitized from logs. For sensitive information, consider using the secure credentials feature. Environment variables Environmental variables allow you to fine-tune the CPM configuration to meet your specific environmental and functional needs.

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

      "body": "Use synthetic monitoring's API tests to monitor your API endpoint to ensure it is functioning correctly. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. Here we present some example functions showing how to use the $http object to submit your request. For detailed documentation on the options available for this object, see the http-request readme. Tip To view and share other API test examples, visit the synthetics scripts section in Explorers Hub. Use API http-request module API tests are powered by the http-request module, which is available through the $http object. Once each frequency interval, New Relic queries your endpoint from each of your selected locations. For instructions on creating a monitor, see Adding monitors. Read on to learn how to define metadata for your request, make a GET request, make a POST request, and how to validate the results. Important After a maximum run time of three minutes, New Relic manually stops the script. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: The script editor suggests functions, selectors, and other elements to simplify scripting commands (available in GitHub). Configure request options To start your script: Declare a variable (such as options) to store your request options object. Define request options such as the URL endpoint, and custom headers. If you're setting SSL or agent options, see SSL and agentOptions requirements. Tip For a full list of supported request options, see request(options, callback) in the http-request documentation on GitHub. Here's an example of optional metadata in the options object: Using optional metadata //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } }; Copy For SSL and agentOptions: If you are setting SSL options or providing an agentOptions object, the agent property in the request options object will need to be set to $globalAgents.https or $globalAgents.http to ensure your HTTP requests use the instrumented global agent. Here's an example of using a SSL option or agentOptions: Using a SSL option or agentOptions This example uses agentOptions: //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } //Specify global agent as the http agent agent: $globalAgents.https, //Set SSL option strictSSL: true, //Specify http agent options agentOptions: { ​maxVersion: 'TLSv1.1' }, }; Copy Send a GET request To make a GET request, use the $http.get method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.get, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights GET example This example queries the Insights API by using GET: //Define your authentication credentials var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myQueryKey = '{YOUR_QUERY_KEY}'; var options = { //Define endpoint URI uri: 'https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/'+myAccountID+'/query?nrql=SELECT%20average(amount)%20FROM%20SyntheticsEvent', //Define query key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback (err, response, body){ //Log JSON results from endpoint to Synthetics console. console.log(JSON.parse(body)); console.log('done with script'); } //Make GET request, passing in options and callback. $http.get(options,callback); Copy Send a POST request To make a POST request, use the $http.post method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.post, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Custom event POST example This example POSTs a custom event containing static integers to the Event API: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the 'assert' module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Verify endpoint returns 200 (OK) response code. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); //Parse JSON received from Insights into variable. var info = JSON.parse(body); //Verify that `info` contains element named `success` with a value of `true`. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); //Log end of script. console.log(\"End reached\"); } //Make POST request, passing in options and callback. $http.post(options, callback); Copy Validate results To validate your results, import the assert module to define your test case. Call an assert method to validate your endpoint's response. If any assert functions fail, the entire monitor will be considered a failed check. This may trigger alert notifications and affect your metrics. Important Synthetic monitoring does not allow thrown exceptions. Thrown exceptions result in script failure. Use the assert module to validate your results, and use console.log() to log results to the synthetic's console. Event API validation example This example POSTs to the Event API, then validates that the response is {\"success\":true}: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the `assert` module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; $http.post(options, function(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. The status code is logged before the `assert` function, //because a failed assert function ends the script. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Call `assert` method, expecting a `200` response code. //If assertion fails, log `Expected 200 OK response` as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); var info = JSON.parse(body); //Call `assert` method, expecting body to return `{\"success\":true}`. //If assertion fails, log `Expected True results in Response Body,` plus results as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); }); Copy",

      "body": "This document is for synthetic monitor versions 0.4.x or lower. See also the documentation for Synthetic monitor versions 0.5 or higher. Overview Synthetic scripted browsers provide you access to the Selenium Webdriver APIs 2.47.0 via the variables $driver and $browser. In particular: $driver provides all the exports from the selenium-webdriver module (for example, ActionSequence, Button, By, WebElement, etc.). $browser is a synthetic-flavored instance of selenium-webdriver.WebDriver(): it exposes the main basic WebDriver APIs like get() and findElement(), as well as some synthetic custom APIs. This document describes the functions available for synthetic scripted browser monitors version 0.4.0 or lower. For the newest monitor documentation, see monitor version 0.5.0+ documentation. Other relevant documentation: For more on synthetic scripting, see Write scripted browsers. For example scripts, see Scripted browser examples. For more information about monitor versions and runtime differences, see Runtime environments. To view and share scripted browser examples, check out topics tagged synthetic-script in New Relic's Explorers Hub. Top-level functions: Build your script New Relic calls top-level functions directly from your $browser instance. These provide a wide range of functionality that covers many basic scriptable actions. Function Return value $browser.actions() Creates a new action sequence using this driver. For a list of available actions, see ActionSequence: Link multiple actions. void $browser.addHeader(headerKey: string, headerValue: string) Adds header headerKey with value headerValue to the runtime. void $browser.addHeaders(headers: ?) Adds a map of headers to the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeader(header: string) Deletes a specific header from the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeaders(header: [string]) Deletes all headers in argument from runtime. void $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist(hostname: string) Disallows a hostname. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnamesToBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Disallows all hostnames in an array of arguments. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnameToWhitelist(hostname: string) Allows a hostname blocked by default in synthetic monitoring. void $browser.addHostnamesToWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Allows all hostnames in argument. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromBlacklist(hostname: string) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's blacklist. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from the disallowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.executeAsyncScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute asynchronous JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.executeScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to find an element on the page. If not found, New Relic returns an error. WebElement $browser.findElements(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to search for multiple elements on the page. promise $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) Schedule a command to wait for and find an element on the page, and another command to wait for it to be visible. If not found, New Relic returns an error. The timeout value is an optional one, and gets applied separately to both tasks of finding the element and waiting for its visibility. This means at worst case, this method can take up to twice the provided timeout value. The default timeout value is 1000 ms (1 second). promise $browser.get(url: string) Loads a webpage in a synthetic browser. promise $browser.getAllWindowHandles() Schedules a command to retrieve the current list of available window handles. promise $browser.getCapabilities() A promise that will resolve with the instance's capabilities. promise $browser.getCurrentUrl() Schedules a command to retrieve the URL of the current page. promise $browser.getHeaders() Returns a map of currently configured headers. map $browser.getPageSource() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's source. The page source returned is a representation of the underlying DOM; do not expect it to be formatted or escaped in the same way as the response sent from the web server. promise $browser.getSession() A promise for this client's session. promise $browser.getTitle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's title. promise $browser.getWindowHandle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current window handle. promise $browser.isElementPresent(locatorOrElement: $driver.Locator) Schedules a command to test if an element is present on the page. If given a DOM element, this function will check if it belongs to the document the driver is currently focused on. Otherwise, the function will test if at least one element can be found with the given search criteria. promise $browser.manage() The options interface for this instance. You can manage cookies, timeouts, and other window options. void $browser.navigate() The navigation interface (history of browser functions) for this instance. void $browser.schedule(command: ?, description: string) Schedules a command to be executed by this driver's CommandExecutor. promise $browser.sleep() Schedules a command to make the driver sleep for the given amount of time. promise $browser.switchTo() The target locator interface for this instance. void $browser.takeScreenshot() Schedule a command to take a screenshot. promise $browser.wait(fn: $driver.until.Condition, timeout: number, opt_message: string) Schedules a command to wait for a condition to hold, as defined by some user supplied function. webElement $browser.waitForPendingRequests(timeout: number) Causes the script to wait for requests that have been initiated to return, up to the timeout. Useful for tracking non-blocking resources. promise Disallow list: Wildcard use Disallowing domains for your browser instance requires wildcards to match the URL syntax of the URL to be blocked. An overall .com disallowed list needs to contain these functions: Function Blocking action $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.com'); a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.com'); a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.*.com'); a.b.c.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.com'); www.a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.com'); www.a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.*.com'); www.a.b.c.com Options: Manage the browser instance These functions manage options for your browser instance such as cookies, timeouts and window size. Access these options through the $browser.manage() function. Function Return value $browser.manage().addCookie(name: string, value: string, opt_path: string, opt_domain: string, opt_isSecure: boolean, opt_expiry: number) Schedules a command to add a cookie. promise $browser.manage().deleteAllCookies() Schedules a command to delete all cookies visible to the current page. promise $browser.manage().deleteCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to delete the cookie with the given name. This command is a no-op if there is no cookie with the given name visible to the current page. promise $browser.manage().getCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to retrieve the cookie with the given name. Returns null if there is no such cookie. The cookie will be returned as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. promise $browser.manage().getCookies() Schedules a command to retrieve all cookies visible to the current page. New Relic Syntheticcs returns each cookie as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(ms: number) Specifies the amount of time the driver should wait when searching for an element if it is not immediately present. Setting the wait timeout to 0 disables implicit waiting. Be careful increasing the wait timeout, as it will increase test run time, especially with slower location strategies like XPath. Default is 10 seconds. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait for a page load to complete before returning an error. If the timeout is negative, page loads may last up to 180 seconds. Default is 60 seconds. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().setScriptTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait, in milliseconds, for an asynchronous script to finish execution before returning an error. Default is 30 seconds. promise $browser.manage().window().getPosition() Retrieves the window's current position, relative to the top left corner of the screen. promise $browser.manage().window().getSize() Retrieves the window's current size. promise $browser.manage().window().maximize() Maximizes the current window. promise $browser.manage().window().setPosition(x: number, y: number) Repositions the current window. promise $browser.manage().window().setSize(width: number, height: number) Resizes the current window. promise Locators: Find page elements Locators are a collection of factory functions for creating locator instances. Locators find DOM elements, which can be passed to functions such as $browser.findElement or $browser.isElementPresent. Call them through $driver.By. Function Return value $driver.By.className(className: string) Locates an element that has a specific class name. The returned locator is equivalent to searching for elements with the CSS selector .clazz. locator $driver.By.css(cssName: string) Locates an element using a CSS selector. locator $driver.By.id(id: string) Locates an element by its ID. locator $driver.By.linkText(linkText: string) Locates link elements whose visible text matches the given string. locator $driver.By.js(js: string) Locates an element by evaluating a JavaScript expression. locator $driver.By.name(name: string) Locates elements whose name attribute has the given value. locator $driver.By.partialLinkText(partialLinkText: string) Locates link elements whose getText visible contains the given substring. locator $driver.By.tagName(tagName: string) Locates elements with a given tag name. The returned locator is equivalent to using the getElementsByTagName DOM function. locator $driver.By.xpath(xpath: string) Locates elements matching a XPath selector. locator WebElement: Interact with page elements When a function such as $browser.findElement or $browser.waitForAndFindElement returns a WebElement reference, these functions can be used to interact with that element. Using these, you can click on buttons, sent text to form inputs, and get attributes of elements to test. Function Return value click() Clicks on this element. void sendKeys(var_args: ?) Schedules a command to type a sequence on the DOM element represented by this instance. WebElement getTagName() Schedules a command to query for the tag/node name of this element. WebElement getCssValue(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the computed style of the element represented by this instance. If the element inherits the named style from its parent, the parent will be queried for its value. Where possible, color values will be converted to their hex representation (for example, #00ff00 instead of rgb(0, 255, 0)). promise getAttribute(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the value of the given attribute of the element. promise getText(name: string) Get the visible (not hidden by CSS) innerText of this element, including sub-elements, without any leading or trailing white space. promise getSize() Schedules a command to compute the size of this element's bounding box, in pixels. promise getLocation() Schedules a command to compute the location of this element, in page space. promise isEnabled() Schedules a command to query whether the DOM element represented by this instance is enabled, as dictated by the disabled attribute. promise isSelected() Schedules a command to query whether this element is selected. promise submit() Schedules a command to submit the form containing this element (or this element if it is a FORM element). This command is a no-op if the element is not contained in a form. promise clear() Schedules a command to clear the value of this element. promise isDisplayed() Schedules a command to test whether this element is currently displayed. promise getOuterHtml() Schedules a command to retrieve the outer HTML of this element. promise getInnerHtml() Schedules a command to retrieve the inner HTML of this element. promise ActionSequence: Link multiple actions Action sequences can create complex user interactions with your website. To create a new action sequence, use $browser.actions(). To link multiple actions together into a sequence, include perform() after each. This executes and then terminates individual sequences, including single-action sequences. The following table contains a list of available actions. For more information, see the WebDriver ActionSequence documentation. Function Return value click(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. This is equivalent to WebElement.click(). actionsequence doubleClick(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Double-clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. actionsequence dragAndDrop(element: ?, location: ?) Convenience function for performing a \"drag and drop\" maneuver. The target element may be moved to the location of another element, or by an offset (in pixels). The location is an object with two properties x and y: {x: x_offset, y: y_offset}. actionsequence keyDown(key: ?) Performs a modifier key press. Must be one of ALT, CONTROL, SHIFT, COMMAND, or META. The modifier key is not released until keyUp() or sendKeys() is called. The key press will be targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence keyUp(key: ?) Performs a modifier key release. The release is targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence mouseDown(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Presses a mouse button. The mouse button will not be released until mouseUp is called, regardless of whether that call is made in this sequence or another. The behavior for out-of-order events (such as calling mouseDown() or click() when the button is already held down) is undefined. actionsequence mouseUp(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Releases a mouse button. Behavior is undefined for calling this function without a previous call to mouseDown(). actionsequence mouseMove(location: ?, offset: ?) Moves the mouse. The location to move to may be specified in terms of the mouse's current location, an offset relative to the top-left corner of an element, or an element (in which case the middle of the element is used). actionsequence perform() Executes this action sequence. promise sendKeys(args: ?) Simulates typing multiple keys. Each modifier key encountered in the sequence will not be released until it is encountered again. All key events will be targeted at the currently focused element. For a full list of supported non-alphanumeric keys, see the WebDriver enum key documentation. actionsequence Promises: Link actions into sequences You can also execute functions directly on promises. Synthetic monitoring is a native Node.js environment and uses standard Node.js promises. These functions evaluate the status of promises, cancel them, and more. In particular, you can create sequences of actions with the then() function and its siblings, thenFinally() and thenCatch(). For more information, see Sequence actions. Function Return value cancel(string: reason) Cancels the computation of this promise's value, rejecting the promise in the process. This method is a no-op if the promise has already been resolved. void isPending() Whether this promise's value is still being computed. boolean then(opt_callback: fn(T: ?), opt_errback: fn()) Registers listeners for when this instance is resolved. This is the basic function used to link synchronous actions in your script. promise thenFinally(callback: fn()) Registers a listener to invoke when this promise is resolved, regardless of whether the promise's value was successfully computed. promise thenCatch(callback: fn()) Registers a listener for when this promise is rejected. promise Navigate: Move through browser history The $browser.navigate() function exposes a number of functions that allow you to move backwards and forwards through your browser history, refresh your page and navigate to new pages. Function Return value back() Move back by one step in the browser's history. void forward() Move forward by one step in the browser's history. void refresh() Refresh the current page. void to(string: url) Load a new webpage in the current browser window. $browser.navigate().to() is equivalent to $browser.get(). void Conditions: Pause and wait for conditions Used with $browser.wait, until pauses your script execution until the condition is matched. For more information on explicit and implicit waits, see the WebDriver documentation. For .wait and .until usage examples, see Webdriver.wait examples. The following are available functions for $driver.until.Condition: Function Return value ableToSwitchToFrame(frame: ?) Creates a condition that will wait until the input driver is able to switch to the designated frame. The target frame may be specified as: A numeric index into window.frames for the current frame A webdriver.WebElement, which must reference a FRAME or IFRAME element on the current page A locator which may be used to first locate a FRAME or IFRAME on the current page before attempting to switch to it Upon successful resolution of this condition, the driver will be left focused on the new frame. condition alertIsPresent() Creates a condition that waits for an alert to be opened. Upon success, the returned promise will be fulfilled with the handle for the opened alert. condition elementIsDisabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be disabled. condition elementIsEnabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be enabled. condition elementIsNotVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be in the DOM, yet not visible to the user. condition elementIsVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become visible. condition elementIsSelected(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be selected. condition elementLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until an element is found with the given locator. condition elementsLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until at least one element is found with the given locator. condition elementTextContains(element: $driver.WebElement, substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to contain the given substring. condition elementTextIs(element: $driver.WebElement, text: string) Case sensitive. Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match the given text exactly. condition elementTextMatches(element: $driver.WebElement, regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match a regular expression. condition stalenessOf(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become stale. An element is considered stale once it is removed from the DOM, or a new page has loaded. condition titleContains(substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to contain the given substring. condition titleIs(title: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given value. condition titleMatches(regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given regular expression. condition For more help Additional documentation resources include: Writing scripted browsers (how to build WebDriverJS scripts for multi-step monitoring) Scripted browser examples (example code for scripted browsers, including comments, with examples like searching a website and waiting for results to load)",

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

      "body": "Use synthetic monitoring's API tests to monitor your API endpoint to ensure it is functioning correctly. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. Here we present some example functions showing how to use the $http object to submit your request. For detailed documentation on the options available for this object, see the http-request readme. Tip To view and share other API test examples, visit the synthetics scripts section in Explorers Hub. Use API http-request module API tests are powered by the http-request module, which is available through the $http object. Once each frequency interval, New Relic queries your endpoint from each of your selected locations. For instructions on creating a monitor, see Adding monitors. Read on to learn how to define metadata for your request, make a GET request, make a POST request, and how to validate the results. Important After a maximum run time of three minutes, New Relic manually stops the script. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: The script editor suggests functions, selectors, and other elements to simplify scripting commands (available in GitHub). Configure request options To start your script: Declare a variable (such as options) to store your request options object. Define request options such as the URL endpoint, and custom headers. If you're setting SSL or agent options, see SSL and agentOptions requirements. Tip For a full list of supported request options, see request(options, callback) in the http-request documentation on GitHub. Here's an example of optional metadata in the options object: Using optional metadata //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } }; Copy For SSL and agentOptions: If you are setting SSL options or providing an agentOptions object, the agent property in the request options object will need to be set to $globalAgents.https or $globalAgents.http to ensure your HTTP requests use the instrumented global agent. Here's an example of using a SSL option or agentOptions: Using a SSL option or agentOptions This example uses agentOptions: //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } //Specify global agent as the http agent agent: $globalAgents.https, //Set SSL option strictSSL: true, //Specify http agent options agentOptions: { ​maxVersion: 'TLSv1.1' }, }; Copy Send a GET request To make a GET request, use the $http.get method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.get, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights GET example This example queries the Insights API by using GET: //Define your authentication credentials var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myQueryKey = '{YOUR_QUERY_KEY}'; var options = { //Define endpoint URI uri: 'https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/'+myAccountID+'/query?nrql=SELECT%20average(amount)%20FROM%20SyntheticsEvent', //Define query key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback (err, response, body){ //Log JSON results from endpoint to Synthetics console. console.log(JSON.parse(body)); console.log('done with script'); } //Make GET request, passing in options and callback. $http.get(options,callback); Copy Send a POST request To make a POST request, use the $http.post method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.post, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Custom event POST example This example POSTs a custom event containing static integers to the Event API: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the 'assert' module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Verify endpoint returns 200 (OK) response code. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); //Parse JSON received from Insights into variable. var info = JSON.parse(body); //Verify that `info` contains element named `success` with a value of `true`. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); //Log end of script. console.log(\"End reached\"); } //Make POST request, passing in options and callback. $http.post(options, callback); Copy Validate results To validate your results, import the assert module to define your test case. Call an assert method to validate your endpoint's response. If any assert functions fail, the entire monitor will be considered a failed check. This may trigger alert notifications and affect your metrics. Important Synthetic monitoring does not allow thrown exceptions. Thrown exceptions result in script failure. Use the assert module to validate your results, and use console.log() to log results to the synthetic's console. Event API validation example This example POSTs to the Event API, then validates that the response is {\"success\":true}: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the `assert` module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; $http.post(options, function(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. The status code is logged before the `assert` function, //because a failed assert function ends the script. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Call `assert` method, expecting a `200` response code. //If assertion fails, log `Expected 200 OK response` as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); var info = JSON.parse(body); //Call `assert` method, expecting body to return `{\"success\":true}`. //If assertion fails, log `Expected True results in Response Body,` plus results as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); }); Copy",

      "body": "This document is for synthetic monitor versions 0.4.x or lower. See also the documentation for Synthetic monitor versions 0.5 or higher. Overview Synthetic scripted browsers provide you access to the Selenium Webdriver APIs 2.47.0 via the variables $driver and $browser. In particular: $driver provides all the exports from the selenium-webdriver module (for example, ActionSequence, Button, By, WebElement, etc.). $browser is a synthetic-flavored instance of selenium-webdriver.WebDriver(): it exposes the main basic WebDriver APIs like get() and findElement(), as well as some synthetic custom APIs. This document describes the functions available for synthetic scripted browser monitors version 0.4.0 or lower. For the newest monitor documentation, see monitor version 0.5.0+ documentation. Other relevant documentation: For more on synthetic scripting, see Write scripted browsers. For example scripts, see Scripted browser examples. For more information about monitor versions and runtime differences, see Runtime environments. To view and share scripted browser examples, check out topics tagged synthetic-script in New Relic's Explorers Hub. Top-level functions: Build your script New Relic calls top-level functions directly from your $browser instance. These provide a wide range of functionality that covers many basic scriptable actions. Function Return value $browser.actions() Creates a new action sequence using this driver. For a list of available actions, see ActionSequence: Link multiple actions. void $browser.addHeader(headerKey: string, headerValue: string) Adds header headerKey with value headerValue to the runtime. void $browser.addHeaders(headers: ?) Adds a map of headers to the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeader(header: string) Deletes a specific header from the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeaders(header: [string]) Deletes all headers in argument from runtime. void $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist(hostname: string) Disallows a hostname. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnamesToBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Disallows all hostnames in an array of arguments. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnameToWhitelist(hostname: string) Allows a hostname blocked by default in synthetic monitoring. void $browser.addHostnamesToWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Allows all hostnames in argument. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromBlacklist(hostname: string) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's blacklist. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from the disallowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.executeAsyncScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute asynchronous JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.executeScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to find an element on the page. If not found, New Relic returns an error. WebElement $browser.findElements(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to search for multiple elements on the page. promise $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) Schedule a command to wait for and find an element on the page, and another command to wait for it to be visible. If not found, New Relic returns an error. The timeout value is an optional one, and gets applied separately to both tasks of finding the element and waiting for its visibility. This means at worst case, this method can take up to twice the provided timeout value. The default timeout value is 1000 ms (1 second). promise $browser.get(url: string) Loads a webpage in a synthetic browser. promise $browser.getAllWindowHandles() Schedules a command to retrieve the current list of available window handles. promise $browser.getCapabilities() A promise that will resolve with the instance's capabilities. promise $browser.getCurrentUrl() Schedules a command to retrieve the URL of the current page. promise $browser.getHeaders() Returns a map of currently configured headers. map $browser.getPageSource() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's source. The page source returned is a representation of the underlying DOM; do not expect it to be formatted or escaped in the same way as the response sent from the web server. promise $browser.getSession() A promise for this client's session. promise $browser.getTitle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's title. promise $browser.getWindowHandle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current window handle. promise $browser.isElementPresent(locatorOrElement: $driver.Locator) Schedules a command to test if an element is present on the page. If given a DOM element, this function will check if it belongs to the document the driver is currently focused on. Otherwise, the function will test if at least one element can be found with the given search criteria. promise $browser.manage() The options interface for this instance. You can manage cookies, timeouts, and other window options. void $browser.navigate() The navigation interface (history of browser functions) for this instance. void $browser.schedule(command: ?, description: string) Schedules a command to be executed by this driver's CommandExecutor. promise $browser.sleep() Schedules a command to make the driver sleep for the given amount of time. promise $browser.switchTo() The target locator interface for this instance. void $browser.takeScreenshot() Schedule a command to take a screenshot. promise $browser.wait(fn: $driver.until.Condition, timeout: number, opt_message: string) Schedules a command to wait for a condition to hold, as defined by some user supplied function. webElement $browser.waitForPendingRequests(timeout: number) Causes the script to wait for requests that have been initiated to return, up to the timeout. Useful for tracking non-blocking resources. promise Disallow list: Wildcard use Disallowing domains for your browser instance requires wildcards to match the URL syntax of the URL to be blocked. An overall .com disallowed list needs to contain these functions: Function Blocking action $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.com'); a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.com'); a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.*.com'); a.b.c.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.com'); www.a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.com'); www.a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.*.com'); www.a.b.c.com Options: Manage the browser instance These functions manage options for your browser instance such as cookies, timeouts and window size. Access these options through the $browser.manage() function. Function Return value $browser.manage().addCookie(name: string, value: string, opt_path: string, opt_domain: string, opt_isSecure: boolean, opt_expiry: number) Schedules a command to add a cookie. promise $browser.manage().deleteAllCookies() Schedules a command to delete all cookies visible to the current page. promise $browser.manage().deleteCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to delete the cookie with the given name. This command is a no-op if there is no cookie with the given name visible to the current page. promise $browser.manage().getCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to retrieve the cookie with the given name. Returns null if there is no such cookie. The cookie will be returned as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. promise $browser.manage().getCookies() Schedules a command to retrieve all cookies visible to the current page. New Relic Syntheticcs returns each cookie as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(ms: number) Specifies the amount of time the driver should wait when searching for an element if it is not immediately present. Setting the wait timeout to 0 disables implicit waiting. Be careful increasing the wait timeout, as it will increase test run time, especially with slower location strategies like XPath. Default is 10 seconds. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait for a page load to complete before returning an error. If the timeout is negative, page loads may last up to 180 seconds. Default is 60 seconds. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().setScriptTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait, in milliseconds, for an asynchronous script to finish execution before returning an error. Default is 30 seconds. promise $browser.manage().window().getPosition() Retrieves the window's current position, relative to the top left corner of the screen. promise $browser.manage().window().getSize() Retrieves the window's current size. promise $browser.manage().window().maximize() Maximizes the current window. promise $browser.manage().window().setPosition(x: number, y: number) Repositions the current window. promise $browser.manage().window().setSize(width: number, height: number) Resizes the current window. promise Locators: Find page elements Locators are a collection of factory functions for creating locator instances. Locators find DOM elements, which can be passed to functions such as $browser.findElement or $browser.isElementPresent. Call them through $driver.By. Function Return value $driver.By.className(className: string) Locates an element that has a specific class name. The returned locator is equivalent to searching for elements with the CSS selector .clazz. locator $driver.By.css(cssName: string) Locates an element using a CSS selector. locator $driver.By.id(id: string) Locates an element by its ID. locator $driver.By.linkText(linkText: string) Locates link elements whose visible text matches the given string. locator $driver.By.js(js: string) Locates an element by evaluating a JavaScript expression. locator $driver.By.name(name: string) Locates elements whose name attribute has the given value. locator $driver.By.partialLinkText(partialLinkText: string) Locates link elements whose getText visible contains the given substring. locator $driver.By.tagName(tagName: string) Locates elements with a given tag name. The returned locator is equivalent to using the getElementsByTagName DOM function. locator $driver.By.xpath(xpath: string) Locates elements matching a XPath selector. locator WebElement: Interact with page elements When a function such as $browser.findElement or $browser.waitForAndFindElement returns a WebElement reference, these functions can be used to interact with that element. Using these, you can click on buttons, sent text to form inputs, and get attributes of elements to test. Function Return value click() Clicks on this element. void sendKeys(var_args: ?) Schedules a command to type a sequence on the DOM element represented by this instance. WebElement getTagName() Schedules a command to query for the tag/node name of this element. WebElement getCssValue(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the computed style of the element represented by this instance. If the element inherits the named style from its parent, the parent will be queried for its value. Where possible, color values will be converted to their hex representation (for example, #00ff00 instead of rgb(0, 255, 0)). promise getAttribute(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the value of the given attribute of the element. promise getText(name: string) Get the visible (not hidden by CSS) innerText of this element, including sub-elements, without any leading or trailing white space. promise getSize() Schedules a command to compute the size of this element's bounding box, in pixels. promise getLocation() Schedules a command to compute the location of this element, in page space. promise isEnabled() Schedules a command to query whether the DOM element represented by this instance is enabled, as dictated by the disabled attribute. promise isSelected() Schedules a command to query whether this element is selected. promise submit() Schedules a command to submit the form containing this element (or this element if it is a FORM element). This command is a no-op if the element is not contained in a form. promise clear() Schedules a command to clear the value of this element. promise isDisplayed() Schedules a command to test whether this element is currently displayed. promise getOuterHtml() Schedules a command to retrieve the outer HTML of this element. promise getInnerHtml() Schedules a command to retrieve the inner HTML of this element. promise ActionSequence: Link multiple actions Action sequences can create complex user interactions with your website. To create a new action sequence, use $browser.actions(). To link multiple actions together into a sequence, include perform() after each. This executes and then terminates individual sequences, including single-action sequences. The following table contains a list of available actions. For more information, see the WebDriver ActionSequence documentation. Function Return value click(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. This is equivalent to WebElement.click(). actionsequence doubleClick(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Double-clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. actionsequence dragAndDrop(element: ?, location: ?) Convenience function for performing a \"drag and drop\" maneuver. The target element may be moved to the location of another element, or by an offset (in pixels). The location is an object with two properties x and y: {x: x_offset, y: y_offset}. actionsequence keyDown(key: ?) Performs a modifier key press. Must be one of ALT, CONTROL, SHIFT, COMMAND, or META. The modifier key is not released until keyUp() or sendKeys() is called. The key press will be targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence keyUp(key: ?) Performs a modifier key release. The release is targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence mouseDown(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Presses a mouse button. The mouse button will not be released until mouseUp is called, regardless of whether that call is made in this sequence or another. The behavior for out-of-order events (such as calling mouseDown() or click() when the button is already held down) is undefined. actionsequence mouseUp(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Releases a mouse button. Behavior is undefined for calling this function without a previous call to mouseDown(). actionsequence mouseMove(location: ?, offset: ?) Moves the mouse. The location to move to may be specified in terms of the mouse's current location, an offset relative to the top-left corner of an element, or an element (in which case the middle of the element is used). actionsequence perform() Executes this action sequence. promise sendKeys(args: ?) Simulates typing multiple keys. Each modifier key encountered in the sequence will not be released until it is encountered again. All key events will be targeted at the currently focused element. For a full list of supported non-alphanumeric keys, see the WebDriver enum key documentation. actionsequence Promises: Link actions into sequences You can also execute functions directly on promises. Synthetic monitoring is a native Node.js environment and uses standard Node.js promises. These functions evaluate the status of promises, cancel them, and more. In particular, you can create sequences of actions with the then() function and its siblings, thenFinally() and thenCatch(). For more information, see Sequence actions. Function Return value cancel(string: reason) Cancels the computation of this promise's value, rejecting the promise in the process. This method is a no-op if the promise has already been resolved. void isPending() Whether this promise's value is still being computed. boolean then(opt_callback: fn(T: ?), opt_errback: fn()) Registers listeners for when this instance is resolved. This is the basic function used to link synchronous actions in your script. promise thenFinally(callback: fn()) Registers a listener to invoke when this promise is resolved, regardless of whether the promise's value was successfully computed. promise thenCatch(callback: fn()) Registers a listener for when this promise is rejected. promise Navigate: Move through browser history The $browser.navigate() function exposes a number of functions that allow you to move backwards and forwards through your browser history, refresh your page and navigate to new pages. Function Return value back() Move back by one step in the browser's history. void forward() Move forward by one step in the browser's history. void refresh() Refresh the current page. void to(string: url) Load a new webpage in the current browser window. $browser.navigate().to() is equivalent to $browser.get(). void Conditions: Pause and wait for conditions Used with $browser.wait, until pauses your script execution until the condition is matched. For more information on explicit and implicit waits, see the WebDriver documentation. For .wait and .until usage examples, see Webdriver.wait examples. The following are available functions for $driver.until.Condition: Function Return value ableToSwitchToFrame(frame: ?) Creates a condition that will wait until the input driver is able to switch to the designated frame. The target frame may be specified as: A numeric index into window.frames for the current frame A webdriver.WebElement, which must reference a FRAME or IFRAME element on the current page A locator which may be used to first locate a FRAME or IFRAME on the current page before attempting to switch to it Upon successful resolution of this condition, the driver will be left focused on the new frame. condition alertIsPresent() Creates a condition that waits for an alert to be opened. Upon success, the returned promise will be fulfilled with the handle for the opened alert. condition elementIsDisabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be disabled. condition elementIsEnabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be enabled. condition elementIsNotVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be in the DOM, yet not visible to the user. condition elementIsVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become visible. condition elementIsSelected(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be selected. condition elementLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until an element is found with the given locator. condition elementsLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until at least one element is found with the given locator. condition elementTextContains(element: $driver.WebElement, substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to contain the given substring. condition elementTextIs(element: $driver.WebElement, text: string) Case sensitive. Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match the given text exactly. condition elementTextMatches(element: $driver.WebElement, regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match a regular expression. condition stalenessOf(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become stale. An element is considered stale once it is removed from the DOM, or a new page has loaded. condition titleContains(substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to contain the given substring. condition titleIs(title: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given value. condition titleMatches(regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given regular expression. condition For more help Additional documentation resources include: Writing scripted browsers (how to build WebDriverJS scripts for multi-step monitoring) Scripted browser examples (example code for scripted browsers, including comments, with examples like searching a website and waiting for results to load)",

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

      "body": "Use synthetic monitoring's API tests to monitor your API endpoint to ensure it is functioning correctly. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. Here we present some example functions showing how to use the $http object to submit your request. For detailed documentation on the options available for this object, see the http-request readme. Tip To view and share other API test examples, visit the synthetics scripts section in Explorers Hub. Use API http-request module API tests are powered by the http-request module, which is available through the $http object. Once each frequency interval, New Relic queries your endpoint from each of your selected locations. For instructions on creating a monitor, see Adding monitors. Read on to learn how to define metadata for your request, make a GET request, make a POST request, and how to validate the results. Important After a maximum run time of three minutes, New Relic manually stops the script. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: The script editor suggests functions, selectors, and other elements to simplify scripting commands (available in GitHub). Configure request options To start your script: Declare a variable (such as options) to store your request options object. Define request options such as the URL endpoint, and custom headers. If you're setting SSL or agent options, see SSL and agentOptions requirements. Tip For a full list of supported request options, see request(options, callback) in the http-request documentation on GitHub. Here's an example of optional metadata in the options object: Using optional metadata //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } }; Copy For SSL and agentOptions: If you are setting SSL options or providing an agentOptions object, the agent property in the request options object will need to be set to $globalAgents.https or $globalAgents.http to ensure your HTTP requests use the instrumented global agent. Here's an example of using a SSL option or agentOptions: Using a SSL option or agentOptions This example uses agentOptions: //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } //Specify global agent as the http agent agent: $globalAgents.https, //Set SSL option strictSSL: true, //Specify http agent options agentOptions: { ​maxVersion: 'TLSv1.1' }, }; Copy Send a GET request To make a GET request, use the $http.get method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.get, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights GET example This example queries the Insights API by using GET: //Define your authentication credentials var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myQueryKey = '{YOUR_QUERY_KEY}'; var options = { //Define endpoint URI uri: 'https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/'+myAccountID+'/query?nrql=SELECT%20average(amount)%20FROM%20SyntheticsEvent', //Define query key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback (err, response, body){ //Log JSON results from endpoint to Synthetics console. console.log(JSON.parse(body)); console.log('done with script'); } //Make GET request, passing in options and callback. $http.get(options,callback); Copy Send a POST request To make a POST request, use the $http.post method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.post, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Custom event POST example This example POSTs a custom event containing static integers to the Event API: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the 'assert' module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Verify endpoint returns 200 (OK) response code. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); //Parse JSON received from Insights into variable. var info = JSON.parse(body); //Verify that `info` contains element named `success` with a value of `true`. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); //Log end of script. console.log(\"End reached\"); } //Make POST request, passing in options and callback. $http.post(options, callback); Copy Validate results To validate your results, import the assert module to define your test case. Call an assert method to validate your endpoint's response. If any assert functions fail, the entire monitor will be considered a failed check. This may trigger alert notifications and affect your metrics. Important Synthetic monitoring does not allow thrown exceptions. Thrown exceptions result in script failure. Use the assert module to validate your results, and use console.log() to log results to the synthetic's console. Event API validation example This example POSTs to the Event API, then validates that the response is {\"success\":true}: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the `assert` module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; $http.post(options, function(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. The status code is logged before the `assert` function, //because a failed assert function ends the script. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Call `assert` method, expecting a `200` response code. //If assertion fails, log `Expected 200 OK response` as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); var info = JSON.parse(body); //Call `assert` method, expecting body to return `{\"success\":true}`. //If assertion fails, log `Expected True results in Response Body,` plus results as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); }); Copy",

      "body": "This document is for synthetic monitor versions 0.4.x or lower. See also the documentation for Synthetic monitor versions 0.5 or higher. Overview Synthetic scripted browsers provide you access to the Selenium Webdriver APIs 2.47.0 via the variables $driver and $browser. In particular: $driver provides all the exports from the selenium-webdriver module (for example, ActionSequence, Button, By, WebElement, etc.). $browser is a synthetic-flavored instance of selenium-webdriver.WebDriver(): it exposes the main basic WebDriver APIs like get() and findElement(), as well as some synthetic custom APIs. This document describes the functions available for synthetic scripted browser monitors version 0.4.0 or lower. For the newest monitor documentation, see monitor version 0.5.0+ documentation. Other relevant documentation: For more on synthetic scripting, see Write scripted browsers. For example scripts, see Scripted browser examples. For more information about monitor versions and runtime differences, see Runtime environments. To view and share scripted browser examples, check out topics tagged synthetic-script in New Relic's Explorers Hub. Top-level functions: Build your script New Relic calls top-level functions directly from your $browser instance. These provide a wide range of functionality that covers many basic scriptable actions. Function Return value $browser.actions() Creates a new action sequence using this driver. For a list of available actions, see ActionSequence: Link multiple actions. void $browser.addHeader(headerKey: string, headerValue: string) Adds header headerKey with value headerValue to the runtime. void $browser.addHeaders(headers: ?) Adds a map of headers to the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeader(header: string) Deletes a specific header from the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeaders(header: [string]) Deletes all headers in argument from runtime. void $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist(hostname: string) Disallows a hostname. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnamesToBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Disallows all hostnames in an array of arguments. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnameToWhitelist(hostname: string) Allows a hostname blocked by default in synthetic monitoring. void $browser.addHostnamesToWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Allows all hostnames in argument. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromBlacklist(hostname: string) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's blacklist. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from the disallowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.executeAsyncScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute asynchronous JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.executeScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to find an element on the page. If not found, New Relic returns an error. WebElement $browser.findElements(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to search for multiple elements on the page. promise $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) Schedule a command to wait for and find an element on the page, and another command to wait for it to be visible. If not found, New Relic returns an error. The timeout value is an optional one, and gets applied separately to both tasks of finding the element and waiting for its visibility. This means at worst case, this method can take up to twice the provided timeout value. The default timeout value is 1000 ms (1 second). promise $browser.get(url: string) Loads a webpage in a synthetic browser. promise $browser.getAllWindowHandles() Schedules a command to retrieve the current list of available window handles. promise $browser.getCapabilities() A promise that will resolve with the instance's capabilities. promise $browser.getCurrentUrl() Schedules a command to retrieve the URL of the current page. promise $browser.getHeaders() Returns a map of currently configured headers. map $browser.getPageSource() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's source. The page source returned is a representation of the underlying DOM; do not expect it to be formatted or escaped in the same way as the response sent from the web server. promise $browser.getSession() A promise for this client's session. promise $browser.getTitle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's title. promise $browser.getWindowHandle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current window handle. promise $browser.isElementPresent(locatorOrElement: $driver.Locator) Schedules a command to test if an element is present on the page. If given a DOM element, this function will check if it belongs to the document the driver is currently focused on. Otherwise, the function will test if at least one element can be found with the given search criteria. promise $browser.manage() The options interface for this instance. You can manage cookies, timeouts, and other window options. void $browser.navigate() The navigation interface (history of browser functions) for this instance. void $browser.schedule(command: ?, description: string) Schedules a command to be executed by this driver's CommandExecutor. promise $browser.sleep() Schedules a command to make the driver sleep for the given amount of time. promise $browser.switchTo() The target locator interface for this instance. void $browser.takeScreenshot() Schedule a command to take a screenshot. promise $browser.wait(fn: $driver.until.Condition, timeout: number, opt_message: string) Schedules a command to wait for a condition to hold, as defined by some user supplied function. webElement $browser.waitForPendingRequests(timeout: number) Causes the script to wait for requests that have been initiated to return, up to the timeout. Useful for tracking non-blocking resources. promise Disallow list: Wildcard use Disallowing domains for your browser instance requires wildcards to match the URL syntax of the URL to be blocked. An overall .com disallowed list needs to contain these functions: Function Blocking action $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.com'); a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.com'); a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.*.com'); a.b.c.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.com'); www.a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.com'); www.a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.*.com'); www.a.b.c.com Options: Manage the browser instance These functions manage options for your browser instance such as cookies, timeouts and window size. Access these options through the $browser.manage() function. Function Return value $browser.manage().addCookie(name: string, value: string, opt_path: string, opt_domain: string, opt_isSecure: boolean, opt_expiry: number) Schedules a command to add a cookie. promise $browser.manage().deleteAllCookies() Schedules a command to delete all cookies visible to the current page. promise $browser.manage().deleteCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to delete the cookie with the given name. This command is a no-op if there is no cookie with the given name visible to the current page. promise $browser.manage().getCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to retrieve the cookie with the given name. Returns null if there is no such cookie. The cookie will be returned as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. promise $browser.manage().getCookies() Schedules a command to retrieve all cookies visible to the current page. New Relic Syntheticcs returns each cookie as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(ms: number) Specifies the amount of time the driver should wait when searching for an element if it is not immediately present. Setting the wait timeout to 0 disables implicit waiting. Be careful increasing the wait timeout, as it will increase test run time, especially with slower location strategies like XPath. Default is 10 seconds. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait for a page load to complete before returning an error. If the timeout is negative, page loads may last up to 180 seconds. Default is 60 seconds. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().setScriptTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait, in milliseconds, for an asynchronous script to finish execution before returning an error. Default is 30 seconds. promise $browser.manage().window().getPosition() Retrieves the window's current position, relative to the top left corner of the screen. promise $browser.manage().window().getSize() Retrieves the window's current size. promise $browser.manage().window().maximize() Maximizes the current window. promise $browser.manage().window().setPosition(x: number, y: number) Repositions the current window. promise $browser.manage().window().setSize(width: number, height: number) Resizes the current window. promise Locators: Find page elements Locators are a collection of factory functions for creating locator instances. Locators find DOM elements, which can be passed to functions such as $browser.findElement or $browser.isElementPresent. Call them through $driver.By. Function Return value $driver.By.className(className: string) Locates an element that has a specific class name. The returned locator is equivalent to searching for elements with the CSS selector .clazz. locator $driver.By.css(cssName: string) Locates an element using a CSS selector. locator $driver.By.id(id: string) Locates an element by its ID. locator $driver.By.linkText(linkText: string) Locates link elements whose visible text matches the given string. locator $driver.By.js(js: string) Locates an element by evaluating a JavaScript expression. locator $driver.By.name(name: string) Locates elements whose name attribute has the given value. locator $driver.By.partialLinkText(partialLinkText: string) Locates link elements whose getText visible contains the given substring. locator $driver.By.tagName(tagName: string) Locates elements with a given tag name. The returned locator is equivalent to using the getElementsByTagName DOM function. locator $driver.By.xpath(xpath: string) Locates elements matching a XPath selector. locator WebElement: Interact with page elements When a function such as $browser.findElement or $browser.waitForAndFindElement returns a WebElement reference, these functions can be used to interact with that element. Using these, you can click on buttons, sent text to form inputs, and get attributes of elements to test. Function Return value click() Clicks on this element. void sendKeys(var_args: ?) Schedules a command to type a sequence on the DOM element represented by this instance. WebElement getTagName() Schedules a command to query for the tag/node name of this element. WebElement getCssValue(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the computed style of the element represented by this instance. If the element inherits the named style from its parent, the parent will be queried for its value. Where possible, color values will be converted to their hex representation (for example, #00ff00 instead of rgb(0, 255, 0)). promise getAttribute(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the value of the given attribute of the element. promise getText(name: string) Get the visible (not hidden by CSS) innerText of this element, including sub-elements, without any leading or trailing white space. promise getSize() Schedules a command to compute the size of this element's bounding box, in pixels. promise getLocation() Schedules a command to compute the location of this element, in page space. promise isEnabled() Schedules a command to query whether the DOM element represented by this instance is enabled, as dictated by the disabled attribute. promise isSelected() Schedules a command to query whether this element is selected. promise submit() Schedules a command to submit the form containing this element (or this element if it is a FORM element). This command is a no-op if the element is not contained in a form. promise clear() Schedules a command to clear the value of this element. promise isDisplayed() Schedules a command to test whether this element is currently displayed. promise getOuterHtml() Schedules a command to retrieve the outer HTML of this element. promise getInnerHtml() Schedules a command to retrieve the inner HTML of this element. promise ActionSequence: Link multiple actions Action sequences can create complex user interactions with your website. To create a new action sequence, use $browser.actions(). To link multiple actions together into a sequence, include perform() after each. This executes and then terminates individual sequences, including single-action sequences. The following table contains a list of available actions. For more information, see the WebDriver ActionSequence documentation. Function Return value click(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. This is equivalent to WebElement.click(). actionsequence doubleClick(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Double-clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. actionsequence dragAndDrop(element: ?, location: ?) Convenience function for performing a \"drag and drop\" maneuver. The target element may be moved to the location of another element, or by an offset (in pixels). The location is an object with two properties x and y: {x: x_offset, y: y_offset}. actionsequence keyDown(key: ?) Performs a modifier key press. Must be one of ALT, CONTROL, SHIFT, COMMAND, or META. The modifier key is not released until keyUp() or sendKeys() is called. The key press will be targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence keyUp(key: ?) Performs a modifier key release. The release is targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence mouseDown(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Presses a mouse button. The mouse button will not be released until mouseUp is called, regardless of whether that call is made in this sequence or another. The behavior for out-of-order events (such as calling mouseDown() or click() when the button is already held down) is undefined. actionsequence mouseUp(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Releases a mouse button. Behavior is undefined for calling this function without a previous call to mouseDown(). actionsequence mouseMove(location: ?, offset: ?) Moves the mouse. The location to move to may be specified in terms of the mouse's current location, an offset relative to the top-left corner of an element, or an element (in which case the middle of the element is used). actionsequence perform() Executes this action sequence. promise sendKeys(args: ?) Simulates typing multiple keys. Each modifier key encountered in the sequence will not be released until it is encountered again. All key events will be targeted at the currently focused element. For a full list of supported non-alphanumeric keys, see the WebDriver enum key documentation. actionsequence Promises: Link actions into sequences You can also execute functions directly on promises. Synthetic monitoring is a native Node.js environment and uses standard Node.js promises. These functions evaluate the status of promises, cancel them, and more. In particular, you can create sequences of actions with the then() function and its siblings, thenFinally() and thenCatch(). For more information, see Sequence actions. Function Return value cancel(string: reason) Cancels the computation of this promise's value, rejecting the promise in the process. This method is a no-op if the promise has already been resolved. void isPending() Whether this promise's value is still being computed. boolean then(opt_callback: fn(T: ?), opt_errback: fn()) Registers listeners for when this instance is resolved. This is the basic function used to link synchronous actions in your script. promise thenFinally(callback: fn()) Registers a listener to invoke when this promise is resolved, regardless of whether the promise's value was successfully computed. promise thenCatch(callback: fn()) Registers a listener for when this promise is rejected. promise Navigate: Move through browser history The $browser.navigate() function exposes a number of functions that allow you to move backwards and forwards through your browser history, refresh your page and navigate to new pages. Function Return value back() Move back by one step in the browser's history. void forward() Move forward by one step in the browser's history. void refresh() Refresh the current page. void to(string: url) Load a new webpage in the current browser window. $browser.navigate().to() is equivalent to $browser.get(). void Conditions: Pause and wait for conditions Used with $browser.wait, until pauses your script execution until the condition is matched. For more information on explicit and implicit waits, see the WebDriver documentation. For .wait and .until usage examples, see Webdriver.wait examples. The following are available functions for $driver.until.Condition: Function Return value ableToSwitchToFrame(frame: ?) Creates a condition that will wait until the input driver is able to switch to the designated frame. The target frame may be specified as: A numeric index into window.frames for the current frame A webdriver.WebElement, which must reference a FRAME or IFRAME element on the current page A locator which may be used to first locate a FRAME or IFRAME on the current page before attempting to switch to it Upon successful resolution of this condition, the driver will be left focused on the new frame. condition alertIsPresent() Creates a condition that waits for an alert to be opened. Upon success, the returned promise will be fulfilled with the handle for the opened alert. condition elementIsDisabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be disabled. condition elementIsEnabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be enabled. condition elementIsNotVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be in the DOM, yet not visible to the user. condition elementIsVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become visible. condition elementIsSelected(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be selected. condition elementLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until an element is found with the given locator. condition elementsLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until at least one element is found with the given locator. condition elementTextContains(element: $driver.WebElement, substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to contain the given substring. condition elementTextIs(element: $driver.WebElement, text: string) Case sensitive. Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match the given text exactly. condition elementTextMatches(element: $driver.WebElement, regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match a regular expression. condition stalenessOf(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become stale. An element is considered stale once it is removed from the DOM, or a new page has loaded. condition titleContains(substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to contain the given substring. condition titleIs(title: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given value. condition titleMatches(regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given regular expression. condition For more help Additional documentation resources include: Writing scripted browsers (how to build WebDriverJS scripts for multi-step monitoring) Scripted browser examples (example code for scripted browsers, including comments, with examples like searching a website and waiting for results to load)",

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

      "body": "Use synthetic monitoring's API tests to monitor your API endpoint to ensure it is functioning correctly. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. Here we present some example functions showing how to use the $http object to submit your request. For detailed documentation on the options available for this object, see the http-request readme. Tip To view and share other API test examples, visit the synthetics scripts section in Explorers Hub. Use API http-request module API tests are powered by the http-request module, which is available through the $http object. Once each frequency interval, New Relic queries your endpoint from each of your selected locations. For instructions on creating a monitor, see Adding monitors. Read on to learn how to define metadata for your request, make a GET request, make a POST request, and how to validate the results. Important After a maximum run time of three minutes, New Relic manually stops the script. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: The script editor suggests functions, selectors, and other elements to simplify scripting commands (available in GitHub). Configure request options To start your script: Declare a variable (such as options) to store your request options object. Define request options such as the URL endpoint, and custom headers. If you're setting SSL or agent options, see SSL and agentOptions requirements. Tip For a full list of supported request options, see request(options, callback) in the http-request documentation on GitHub. Here's an example of optional metadata in the options object: Using optional metadata //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } }; Copy For SSL and agentOptions: If you are setting SSL options or providing an agentOptions object, the agent property in the request options object will need to be set to $globalAgents.https or $globalAgents.http to ensure your HTTP requests use the instrumented global agent. Here's an example of using a SSL option or agentOptions: Using a SSL option or agentOptions This example uses agentOptions: //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } //Specify global agent as the http agent agent: $globalAgents.https, //Set SSL option strictSSL: true, //Specify http agent options agentOptions: { ​maxVersion: 'TLSv1.1' }, }; Copy Send a GET request To make a GET request, use the $http.get method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.get, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights GET example This example queries the Insights API by using GET: //Define your authentication credentials var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myQueryKey = '{YOUR_QUERY_KEY}'; var options = { //Define endpoint URI uri: 'https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/'+myAccountID+'/query?nrql=SELECT%20average(amount)%20FROM%20SyntheticsEvent', //Define query key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback (err, response, body){ //Log JSON results from endpoint to Synthetics console. console.log(JSON.parse(body)); console.log('done with script'); } //Make GET request, passing in options and callback. $http.get(options,callback); Copy Send a POST request To make a POST request, use the $http.post method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.post, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Custom event POST example This example POSTs a custom event containing static integers to the Event API: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the 'assert' module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Verify endpoint returns 200 (OK) response code. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); //Parse JSON received from Insights into variable. var info = JSON.parse(body); //Verify that `info` contains element named `success` with a value of `true`. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); //Log end of script. console.log(\"End reached\"); } //Make POST request, passing in options and callback. $http.post(options, callback); Copy Validate results To validate your results, import the assert module to define your test case. Call an assert method to validate your endpoint's response. If any assert functions fail, the entire monitor will be considered a failed check. This may trigger alert notifications and affect your metrics. Important Synthetic monitoring does not allow thrown exceptions. Thrown exceptions result in script failure. Use the assert module to validate your results, and use console.log() to log results to the synthetic's console. Event API validation example This example POSTs to the Event API, then validates that the response is {\"success\":true}: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the `assert` module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; $http.post(options, function(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. The status code is logged before the `assert` function, //because a failed assert function ends the script. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Call `assert` method, expecting a `200` response code. //If assertion fails, log `Expected 200 OK response` as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); var info = JSON.parse(body); //Call `assert` method, expecting body to return `{\"success\":true}`. //If assertion fails, log `Expected True results in Response Body,` plus results as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); }); Copy",

      "body": "This document is for synthetic monitor versions 0.4.x or lower. See also the documentation for Synthetic monitor versions 0.5 or higher. Overview Synthetic scripted browsers provide you access to the Selenium Webdriver APIs 2.47.0 via the variables $driver and $browser. In particular: $driver provides all the exports from the selenium-webdriver module (for example, ActionSequence, Button, By, WebElement, etc.). $browser is a synthetic-flavored instance of selenium-webdriver.WebDriver(): it exposes the main basic WebDriver APIs like get() and findElement(), as well as some synthetic custom APIs. This document describes the functions available for synthetic scripted browser monitors version 0.4.0 or lower. For the newest monitor documentation, see monitor version 0.5.0+ documentation. Other relevant documentation: For more on synthetic scripting, see Write scripted browsers. For example scripts, see Scripted browser examples. For more information about monitor versions and runtime differences, see Runtime environments. To view and share scripted browser examples, check out topics tagged synthetic-script in New Relic's Explorers Hub. Top-level functions: Build your script New Relic calls top-level functions directly from your $browser instance. These provide a wide range of functionality that covers many basic scriptable actions. Function Return value $browser.actions() Creates a new action sequence using this driver. For a list of available actions, see ActionSequence: Link multiple actions. void $browser.addHeader(headerKey: string, headerValue: string) Adds header headerKey with value headerValue to the runtime. void $browser.addHeaders(headers: ?) Adds a map of headers to the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeader(header: string) Deletes a specific header from the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeaders(header: [string]) Deletes all headers in argument from runtime. void $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist(hostname: string) Disallows a hostname. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnamesToBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Disallows all hostnames in an array of arguments. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnameToWhitelist(hostname: string) Allows a hostname blocked by default in synthetic monitoring. void $browser.addHostnamesToWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Allows all hostnames in argument. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromBlacklist(hostname: string) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's blacklist. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from the disallowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.executeAsyncScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute asynchronous JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.executeScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to find an element on the page. If not found, New Relic returns an error. WebElement $browser.findElements(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to search for multiple elements on the page. promise $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) Schedule a command to wait for and find an element on the page, and another command to wait for it to be visible. If not found, New Relic returns an error. The timeout value is an optional one, and gets applied separately to both tasks of finding the element and waiting for its visibility. This means at worst case, this method can take up to twice the provided timeout value. The default timeout value is 1000 ms (1 second). promise $browser.get(url: string) Loads a webpage in a synthetic browser. promise $browser.getAllWindowHandles() Schedules a command to retrieve the current list of available window handles. promise $browser.getCapabilities() A promise that will resolve with the instance's capabilities. promise $browser.getCurrentUrl() Schedules a command to retrieve the URL of the current page. promise $browser.getHeaders() Returns a map of currently configured headers. map $browser.getPageSource() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's source. The page source returned is a representation of the underlying DOM; do not expect it to be formatted or escaped in the same way as the response sent from the web server. promise $browser.getSession() A promise for this client's session. promise $browser.getTitle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's title. promise $browser.getWindowHandle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current window handle. promise $browser.isElementPresent(locatorOrElement: $driver.Locator) Schedules a command to test if an element is present on the page. If given a DOM element, this function will check if it belongs to the document the driver is currently focused on. Otherwise, the function will test if at least one element can be found with the given search criteria. promise $browser.manage() The options interface for this instance. You can manage cookies, timeouts, and other window options. void $browser.navigate() The navigation interface (history of browser functions) for this instance. void $browser.schedule(command: ?, description: string) Schedules a command to be executed by this driver's CommandExecutor. promise $browser.sleep() Schedules a command to make the driver sleep for the given amount of time. promise $browser.switchTo() The target locator interface for this instance. void $browser.takeScreenshot() Schedule a command to take a screenshot. promise $browser.wait(fn: $driver.until.Condition, timeout: number, opt_message: string) Schedules a command to wait for a condition to hold, as defined by some user supplied function. webElement $browser.waitForPendingRequests(timeout: number) Causes the script to wait for requests that have been initiated to return, up to the timeout. Useful for tracking non-blocking resources. promise Disallow list: Wildcard use Disallowing domains for your browser instance requires wildcards to match the URL syntax of the URL to be blocked. An overall .com disallowed list needs to contain these functions: Function Blocking action $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.com'); a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.com'); a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.*.com'); a.b.c.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.com'); www.a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.com'); www.a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.*.com'); www.a.b.c.com Options: Manage the browser instance These functions manage options for your browser instance such as cookies, timeouts and window size. Access these options through the $browser.manage() function. Function Return value $browser.manage().addCookie(name: string, value: string, opt_path: string, opt_domain: string, opt_isSecure: boolean, opt_expiry: number) Schedules a command to add a cookie. promise $browser.manage().deleteAllCookies() Schedules a command to delete all cookies visible to the current page. promise $browser.manage().deleteCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to delete the cookie with the given name. This command is a no-op if there is no cookie with the given name visible to the current page. promise $browser.manage().getCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to retrieve the cookie with the given name. Returns null if there is no such cookie. The cookie will be returned as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. promise $browser.manage().getCookies() Schedules a command to retrieve all cookies visible to the current page. New Relic Syntheticcs returns each cookie as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(ms: number) Specifies the amount of time the driver should wait when searching for an element if it is not immediately present. Setting the wait timeout to 0 disables implicit waiting. Be careful increasing the wait timeout, as it will increase test run time, especially with slower location strategies like XPath. Default is 10 seconds. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait for a page load to complete before returning an error. If the timeout is negative, page loads may last up to 180 seconds. Default is 60 seconds. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().setScriptTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait, in milliseconds, for an asynchronous script to finish execution before returning an error. Default is 30 seconds. promise $browser.manage().window().getPosition() Retrieves the window's current position, relative to the top left corner of the screen. promise $browser.manage().window().getSize() Retrieves the window's current size. promise $browser.manage().window().maximize() Maximizes the current window. promise $browser.manage().window().setPosition(x: number, y: number) Repositions the current window. promise $browser.manage().window().setSize(width: number, height: number) Resizes the current window. promise Locators: Find page elements Locators are a collection of factory functions for creating locator instances. Locators find DOM elements, which can be passed to functions such as $browser.findElement or $browser.isElementPresent. Call them through $driver.By. Function Return value $driver.By.className(className: string) Locates an element that has a specific class name. The returned locator is equivalent to searching for elements with the CSS selector .clazz. locator $driver.By.css(cssName: string) Locates an element using a CSS selector. locator $driver.By.id(id: string) Locates an element by its ID. locator $driver.By.linkText(linkText: string) Locates link elements whose visible text matches the given string. locator $driver.By.js(js: string) Locates an element by evaluating a JavaScript expression. locator $driver.By.name(name: string) Locates elements whose name attribute has the given value. locator $driver.By.partialLinkText(partialLinkText: string) Locates link elements whose getText visible contains the given substring. locator $driver.By.tagName(tagName: string) Locates elements with a given tag name. The returned locator is equivalent to using the getElementsByTagName DOM function. locator $driver.By.xpath(xpath: string) Locates elements matching a XPath selector. locator WebElement: Interact with page elements When a function such as $browser.findElement or $browser.waitForAndFindElement returns a WebElement reference, these functions can be used to interact with that element. Using these, you can click on buttons, sent text to form inputs, and get attributes of elements to test. Function Return value click() Clicks on this element. void sendKeys(var_args: ?) Schedules a command to type a sequence on the DOM element represented by this instance. WebElement getTagName() Schedules a command to query for the tag/node name of this element. WebElement getCssValue(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the computed style of the element represented by this instance. If the element inherits the named style from its parent, the parent will be queried for its value. Where possible, color values will be converted to their hex representation (for example, #00ff00 instead of rgb(0, 255, 0)). promise getAttribute(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the value of the given attribute of the element. promise getText(name: string) Get the visible (not hidden by CSS) innerText of this element, including sub-elements, without any leading or trailing white space. promise getSize() Schedules a command to compute the size of this element's bounding box, in pixels. promise getLocation() Schedules a command to compute the location of this element, in page space. promise isEnabled() Schedules a command to query whether the DOM element represented by this instance is enabled, as dictated by the disabled attribute. promise isSelected() Schedules a command to query whether this element is selected. promise submit() Schedules a command to submit the form containing this element (or this element if it is a FORM element). This command is a no-op if the element is not contained in a form. promise clear() Schedules a command to clear the value of this element. promise isDisplayed() Schedules a command to test whether this element is currently displayed. promise getOuterHtml() Schedules a command to retrieve the outer HTML of this element. promise getInnerHtml() Schedules a command to retrieve the inner HTML of this element. promise ActionSequence: Link multiple actions Action sequences can create complex user interactions with your website. To create a new action sequence, use $browser.actions(). To link multiple actions together into a sequence, include perform() after each. This executes and then terminates individual sequences, including single-action sequences. The following table contains a list of available actions. For more information, see the WebDriver ActionSequence documentation. Function Return value click(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. This is equivalent to WebElement.click(). actionsequence doubleClick(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Double-clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. actionsequence dragAndDrop(element: ?, location: ?) Convenience function for performing a \"drag and drop\" maneuver. The target element may be moved to the location of another element, or by an offset (in pixels). The location is an object with two properties x and y: {x: x_offset, y: y_offset}. actionsequence keyDown(key: ?) Performs a modifier key press. Must be one of ALT, CONTROL, SHIFT, COMMAND, or META. The modifier key is not released until keyUp() or sendKeys() is called. The key press will be targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence keyUp(key: ?) Performs a modifier key release. The release is targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence mouseDown(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Presses a mouse button. The mouse button will not be released until mouseUp is called, regardless of whether that call is made in this sequence or another. The behavior for out-of-order events (such as calling mouseDown() or click() when the button is already held down) is undefined. actionsequence mouseUp(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Releases a mouse button. Behavior is undefined for calling this function without a previous call to mouseDown(). actionsequence mouseMove(location: ?, offset: ?) Moves the mouse. The location to move to may be specified in terms of the mouse's current location, an offset relative to the top-left corner of an element, or an element (in which case the middle of the element is used). actionsequence perform() Executes this action sequence. promise sendKeys(args: ?) Simulates typing multiple keys. Each modifier key encountered in the sequence will not be released until it is encountered again. All key events will be targeted at the currently focused element. For a full list of supported non-alphanumeric keys, see the WebDriver enum key documentation. actionsequence Promises: Link actions into sequences You can also execute functions directly on promises. Synthetic monitoring is a native Node.js environment and uses standard Node.js promises. These functions evaluate the status of promises, cancel them, and more. In particular, you can create sequences of actions with the then() function and its siblings, thenFinally() and thenCatch(). For more information, see Sequence actions. Function Return value cancel(string: reason) Cancels the computation of this promise's value, rejecting the promise in the process. This method is a no-op if the promise has already been resolved. void isPending() Whether this promise's value is still being computed. boolean then(opt_callback: fn(T: ?), opt_errback: fn()) Registers listeners for when this instance is resolved. This is the basic function used to link synchronous actions in your script. promise thenFinally(callback: fn()) Registers a listener to invoke when this promise is resolved, regardless of whether the promise's value was successfully computed. promise thenCatch(callback: fn()) Registers a listener for when this promise is rejected. promise Navigate: Move through browser history The $browser.navigate() function exposes a number of functions that allow you to move backwards and forwards through your browser history, refresh your page and navigate to new pages. Function Return value back() Move back by one step in the browser's history. void forward() Move forward by one step in the browser's history. void refresh() Refresh the current page. void to(string: url) Load a new webpage in the current browser window. $browser.navigate().to() is equivalent to $browser.get(). void Conditions: Pause and wait for conditions Used with $browser.wait, until pauses your script execution until the condition is matched. For more information on explicit and implicit waits, see the WebDriver documentation. For .wait and .until usage examples, see Webdriver.wait examples. The following are available functions for $driver.until.Condition: Function Return value ableToSwitchToFrame(frame: ?) Creates a condition that will wait until the input driver is able to switch to the designated frame. The target frame may be specified as: A numeric index into window.frames for the current frame A webdriver.WebElement, which must reference a FRAME or IFRAME element on the current page A locator which may be used to first locate a FRAME or IFRAME on the current page before attempting to switch to it Upon successful resolution of this condition, the driver will be left focused on the new frame. condition alertIsPresent() Creates a condition that waits for an alert to be opened. Upon success, the returned promise will be fulfilled with the handle for the opened alert. condition elementIsDisabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be disabled. condition elementIsEnabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be enabled. condition elementIsNotVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be in the DOM, yet not visible to the user. condition elementIsVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become visible. condition elementIsSelected(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be selected. condition elementLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until an element is found with the given locator. condition elementsLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until at least one element is found with the given locator. condition elementTextContains(element: $driver.WebElement, substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to contain the given substring. condition elementTextIs(element: $driver.WebElement, text: string) Case sensitive. Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match the given text exactly. condition elementTextMatches(element: $driver.WebElement, regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match a regular expression. condition stalenessOf(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become stale. An element is considered stale once it is removed from the DOM, or a new page has loaded. condition titleContains(substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to contain the given substring. condition titleIs(title: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given value. condition titleMatches(regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given regular expression. condition For more help Additional documentation resources include: Writing scripted browsers (how to build WebDriverJS scripts for multi-step monitoring) Scripted browser examples (example code for scripted browsers, including comments, with examples like searching a website and waiting for results to load)",

      "body": "Use synthetic monitoring's API tests to monitor your API endpoint to ensure it is functioning correctly. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. Here we present some example functions showing how to use the $http object to submit your request. For detailed documentation on the options available for this object, see the http-request readme. Tip To view and share other API test examples, visit the synthetics scripts section in Explorers Hub. Use API http-request module API tests are powered by the http-request module, which is available through the $http object. Once each frequency interval, New Relic queries your endpoint from each of your selected locations. For instructions on creating a monitor, see Adding monitors. Read on to learn how to define metadata for your request, make a GET request, make a POST request, and how to validate the results. Important After a maximum run time of three minutes, New Relic manually stops the script. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: The script editor suggests functions, selectors, and other elements to simplify scripting commands (available in GitHub). Configure request options To start your script: Declare a variable (such as options) to store your request options object. Define request options such as the URL endpoint, and custom headers. If you're setting SSL or agent options, see SSL and agentOptions requirements. Tip For a full list of supported request options, see request(options, callback) in the http-request documentation on GitHub. Here's an example of optional metadata in the options object: Using optional metadata //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } }; Copy For SSL and agentOptions: If you are setting SSL options or providing an agentOptions object, the agent property in the request options object will need to be set to $globalAgents.https or $globalAgents.http to ensure your HTTP requests use the instrumented global agent. Here's an example of using a SSL option or agentOptions: Using a SSL option or agentOptions This example uses agentOptions: //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } //Specify global agent as the http agent agent: $globalAgents.https, //Set SSL option strictSSL: true, //Specify http agent options agentOptions: { ​maxVersion: 'TLSv1.1' }, }; Copy Send a GET request To make a GET request, use the $http.get method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.get, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights GET example This example queries the Insights API by using GET: //Define your authentication credentials var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myQueryKey = '{YOUR_QUERY_KEY}'; var options = { //Define endpoint URI uri: 'https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/'+myAccountID+'/query?nrql=SELECT%20average(amount)%20FROM%20SyntheticsEvent', //Define query key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback (err, response, body){ //Log JSON results from endpoint to Synthetics console. console.log(JSON.parse(body)); console.log('done with script'); } //Make GET request, passing in options and callback. $http.get(options,callback); Copy Send a POST request To make a POST request, use the $http.post method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.post, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Custom event POST example This example POSTs a custom event containing static integers to the Event API: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the 'assert' module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Verify endpoint returns 200 (OK) response code. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); //Parse JSON received from Insights into variable. var info = JSON.parse(body); //Verify that `info` contains element named `success` with a value of `true`. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); //Log end of script. console.log(\"End reached\"); } //Make POST request, passing in options and callback. $http.post(options, callback); Copy Validate results To validate your results, import the assert module to define your test case. Call an assert method to validate your endpoint's response. If any assert functions fail, the entire monitor will be considered a failed check. This may trigger alert notifications and affect your metrics. Important Synthetic monitoring does not allow thrown exceptions. Thrown exceptions result in script failure. Use the assert module to validate your results, and use console.log() to log results to the synthetic's console. Event API validation example This example POSTs to the Event API, then validates that the response is {\"success\":true}: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the `assert` module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; $http.post(options, function(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. The status code is logged before the `assert` function, //because a failed assert function ends the script. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Call `assert` method, expecting a `200` response code. //If assertion fails, log `Expected 200 OK response` as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); var info = JSON.parse(body); //Call `assert` method, expecting body to return `{\"success\":true}`. //If assertion fails, log `Expected True results in Response Body,` plus results as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); }); Copy",

      "body": "This document is for synthetic monitor versions 0.4.x or lower. See also the documentation for Synthetic monitor versions 0.5 or higher. Overview Synthetic scripted browsers provide you access to the Selenium Webdriver APIs 2.47.0 via the variables $driver and $browser. In particular: $driver provides all the exports from the selenium-webdriver module (for example, ActionSequence, Button, By, WebElement, etc.). $browser is a synthetic-flavored instance of selenium-webdriver.WebDriver(): it exposes the main basic WebDriver APIs like get() and findElement(), as well as some synthetic custom APIs. This document describes the functions available for synthetic scripted browser monitors version 0.4.0 or lower. For the newest monitor documentation, see monitor version 0.5.0+ documentation. Other relevant documentation: For more on synthetic scripting, see Write scripted browsers. For example scripts, see Scripted browser examples. For more information about monitor versions and runtime differences, see Runtime environments. To view and share scripted browser examples, check out topics tagged synthetic-script in New Relic's Explorers Hub. Top-level functions: Build your script New Relic calls top-level functions directly from your $browser instance. These provide a wide range of functionality that covers many basic scriptable actions. Function Return value $browser.actions() Creates a new action sequence using this driver. For a list of available actions, see ActionSequence: Link multiple actions. void $browser.addHeader(headerKey: string, headerValue: string) Adds header headerKey with value headerValue to the runtime. void $browser.addHeaders(headers: ?) Adds a map of headers to the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeader(header: string) Deletes a specific header from the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeaders(header: [string]) Deletes all headers in argument from runtime. void $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist(hostname: string) Disallows a hostname. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnamesToBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Disallows all hostnames in an array of arguments. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnameToWhitelist(hostname: string) Allows a hostname blocked by default in synthetic monitoring. void $browser.addHostnamesToWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Allows all hostnames in argument. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromBlacklist(hostname: string) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's blacklist. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from the disallowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.executeAsyncScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute asynchronous JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.executeScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to find an element on the page. If not found, New Relic returns an error. WebElement $browser.findElements(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to search for multiple elements on the page. promise $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) Schedule a command to wait for and find an element on the page, and another command to wait for it to be visible. If not found, New Relic returns an error. The timeout value is an optional one, and gets applied separately to both tasks of finding the element and waiting for its visibility. This means at worst case, this method can take up to twice the provided timeout value. The default timeout value is 1000 ms (1 second). promise $browser.get(url: string) Loads a webpage in a synthetic browser. promise $browser.getAllWindowHandles() Schedules a command to retrieve the current list of available window handles. promise $browser.getCapabilities() A promise that will resolve with the instance's capabilities. promise $browser.getCurrentUrl() Schedules a command to retrieve the URL of the current page. promise $browser.getHeaders() Returns a map of currently configured headers. map $browser.getPageSource() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's source. The page source returned is a representation of the underlying DOM; do not expect it to be formatted or escaped in the same way as the response sent from the web server. promise $browser.getSession() A promise for this client's session. promise $browser.getTitle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's title. promise $browser.getWindowHandle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current window handle. promise $browser.isElementPresent(locatorOrElement: $driver.Locator) Schedules a command to test if an element is present on the page. If given a DOM element, this function will check if it belongs to the document the driver is currently focused on. Otherwise, the function will test if at least one element can be found with the given search criteria. promise $browser.manage() The options interface for this instance. You can manage cookies, timeouts, and other window options. void $browser.navigate() The navigation interface (history of browser functions) for this instance. void $browser.schedule(command: ?, description: string) Schedules a command to be executed by this driver's CommandExecutor. promise $browser.sleep() Schedules a command to make the driver sleep for the given amount of time. promise $browser.switchTo() The target locator interface for this instance. void $browser.takeScreenshot() Schedule a command to take a screenshot. promise $browser.wait(fn: $driver.until.Condition, timeout: number, opt_message: string) Schedules a command to wait for a condition to hold, as defined by some user supplied function. webElement $browser.waitForPendingRequests(timeout: number) Causes the script to wait for requests that have been initiated to return, up to the timeout. Useful for tracking non-blocking resources. promise Disallow list: Wildcard use Disallowing domains for your browser instance requires wildcards to match the URL syntax of the URL to be blocked. An overall .com disallowed list needs to contain these functions: Function Blocking action $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.com'); a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.com'); a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.*.com'); a.b.c.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.com'); www.a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.com'); www.a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.*.com'); www.a.b.c.com Options: Manage the browser instance These functions manage options for your browser instance such as cookies, timeouts and window size. Access these options through the $browser.manage() function. Function Return value $browser.manage().addCookie(name: string, value: string, opt_path: string, opt_domain: string, opt_isSecure: boolean, opt_expiry: number) Schedules a command to add a cookie. promise $browser.manage().deleteAllCookies() Schedules a command to delete all cookies visible to the current page. promise $browser.manage().deleteCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to delete the cookie with the given name. This command is a no-op if there is no cookie with the given name visible to the current page. promise $browser.manage().getCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to retrieve the cookie with the given name. Returns null if there is no such cookie. The cookie will be returned as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. promise $browser.manage().getCookies() Schedules a command to retrieve all cookies visible to the current page. New Relic Syntheticcs returns each cookie as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(ms: number) Specifies the amount of time the driver should wait when searching for an element if it is not immediately present. Setting the wait timeout to 0 disables implicit waiting. Be careful increasing the wait timeout, as it will increase test run time, especially with slower location strategies like XPath. Default is 10 seconds. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait for a page load to complete before returning an error. If the timeout is negative, page loads may last up to 180 seconds. Default is 60 seconds. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().setScriptTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait, in milliseconds, for an asynchronous script to finish execution before returning an error. Default is 30 seconds. promise $browser.manage().window().getPosition() Retrieves the window's current position, relative to the top left corner of the screen. promise $browser.manage().window().getSize() Retrieves the window's current size. promise $browser.manage().window().maximize() Maximizes the current window. promise $browser.manage().window().setPosition(x: number, y: number) Repositions the current window. promise $browser.manage().window().setSize(width: number, height: number) Resizes the current window. promise Locators: Find page elements Locators are a collection of factory functions for creating locator instances. Locators find DOM elements, which can be passed to functions such as $browser.findElement or $browser.isElementPresent. Call them through $driver.By. Function Return value $driver.By.className(className: string) Locates an element that has a specific class name. The returned locator is equivalent to searching for elements with the CSS selector .clazz. locator $driver.By.css(cssName: string) Locates an element using a CSS selector. locator $driver.By.id(id: string) Locates an element by its ID. locator $driver.By.linkText(linkText: string) Locates link elements whose visible text matches the given string. locator $driver.By.js(js: string) Locates an element by evaluating a JavaScript expression. locator $driver.By.name(name: string) Locates elements whose name attribute has the given value. locator $driver.By.partialLinkText(partialLinkText: string) Locates link elements whose getText visible contains the given substring. locator $driver.By.tagName(tagName: string) Locates elements with a given tag name. The returned locator is equivalent to using the getElementsByTagName DOM function. locator $driver.By.xpath(xpath: string) Locates elements matching a XPath selector. locator WebElement: Interact with page elements When a function such as $browser.findElement or $browser.waitForAndFindElement returns a WebElement reference, these functions can be used to interact with that element. Using these, you can click on buttons, sent text to form inputs, and get attributes of elements to test. Function Return value click() Clicks on this element. void sendKeys(var_args: ?) Schedules a command to type a sequence on the DOM element represented by this instance. WebElement getTagName() Schedules a command to query for the tag/node name of this element. WebElement getCssValue(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the computed style of the element represented by this instance. If the element inherits the named style from its parent, the parent will be queried for its value. Where possible, color values will be converted to their hex representation (for example, #00ff00 instead of rgb(0, 255, 0)). promise getAttribute(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the value of the given attribute of the element. promise getText(name: string) Get the visible (not hidden by CSS) innerText of this element, including sub-elements, without any leading or trailing white space. promise getSize() Schedules a command to compute the size of this element's bounding box, in pixels. promise getLocation() Schedules a command to compute the location of this element, in page space. promise isEnabled() Schedules a command to query whether the DOM element represented by this instance is enabled, as dictated by the disabled attribute. promise isSelected() Schedules a command to query whether this element is selected. promise submit() Schedules a command to submit the form containing this element (or this element if it is a FORM element). This command is a no-op if the element is not contained in a form. promise clear() Schedules a command to clear the value of this element. promise isDisplayed() Schedules a command to test whether this element is currently displayed. promise getOuterHtml() Schedules a command to retrieve the outer HTML of this element. promise getInnerHtml() Schedules a command to retrieve the inner HTML of this element. promise ActionSequence: Link multiple actions Action sequences can create complex user interactions with your website. To create a new action sequence, use $browser.actions(). To link multiple actions together into a sequence, include perform() after each. This executes and then terminates individual sequences, including single-action sequences. The following table contains a list of available actions. For more information, see the WebDriver ActionSequence documentation. Function Return value click(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. This is equivalent to WebElement.click(). actionsequence doubleClick(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Double-clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. actionsequence dragAndDrop(element: ?, location: ?) Convenience function for performing a \"drag and drop\" maneuver. The target element may be moved to the location of another element, or by an offset (in pixels). The location is an object with two properties x and y: {x: x_offset, y: y_offset}. actionsequence keyDown(key: ?) Performs a modifier key press. Must be one of ALT, CONTROL, SHIFT, COMMAND, or META. The modifier key is not released until keyUp() or sendKeys() is called. The key press will be targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence keyUp(key: ?) Performs a modifier key release. The release is targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence mouseDown(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Presses a mouse button. The mouse button will not be released until mouseUp is called, regardless of whether that call is made in this sequence or another. The behavior for out-of-order events (such as calling mouseDown() or click() when the button is already held down) is undefined. actionsequence mouseUp(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Releases a mouse button. Behavior is undefined for calling this function without a previous call to mouseDown(). actionsequence mouseMove(location: ?, offset: ?) Moves the mouse. The location to move to may be specified in terms of the mouse's current location, an offset relative to the top-left corner of an element, or an element (in which case the middle of the element is used). actionsequence perform() Executes this action sequence. promise sendKeys(args: ?) Simulates typing multiple keys. Each modifier key encountered in the sequence will not be released until it is encountered again. All key events will be targeted at the currently focused element. For a full list of supported non-alphanumeric keys, see the WebDriver enum key documentation. actionsequence Promises: Link actions into sequences You can also execute functions directly on promises. Synthetic monitoring is a native Node.js environment and uses standard Node.js promises. These functions evaluate the status of promises, cancel them, and more. In particular, you can create sequences of actions with the then() function and its siblings, thenFinally() and thenCatch(). For more information, see Sequence actions. Function Return value cancel(string: reason) Cancels the computation of this promise's value, rejecting the promise in the process. This method is a no-op if the promise has already been resolved. void isPending() Whether this promise's value is still being computed. boolean then(opt_callback: fn(T: ?), opt_errback: fn()) Registers listeners for when this instance is resolved. This is the basic function used to link synchronous actions in your script. promise thenFinally(callback: fn()) Registers a listener to invoke when this promise is resolved, regardless of whether the promise's value was successfully computed. promise thenCatch(callback: fn()) Registers a listener for when this promise is rejected. promise Navigate: Move through browser history The $browser.navigate() function exposes a number of functions that allow you to move backwards and forwards through your browser history, refresh your page and navigate to new pages. Function Return value back() Move back by one step in the browser's history. void forward() Move forward by one step in the browser's history. void refresh() Refresh the current page. void to(string: url) Load a new webpage in the current browser window. $browser.navigate().to() is equivalent to $browser.get(). void Conditions: Pause and wait for conditions Used with $browser.wait, until pauses your script execution until the condition is matched. For more information on explicit and implicit waits, see the WebDriver documentation. For .wait and .until usage examples, see Webdriver.wait examples. The following are available functions for $driver.until.Condition: Function Return value ableToSwitchToFrame(frame: ?) Creates a condition that will wait until the input driver is able to switch to the designated frame. The target frame may be specified as: A numeric index into window.frames for the current frame A webdriver.WebElement, which must reference a FRAME or IFRAME element on the current page A locator which may be used to first locate a FRAME or IFRAME on the current page before attempting to switch to it Upon successful resolution of this condition, the driver will be left focused on the new frame. condition alertIsPresent() Creates a condition that waits for an alert to be opened. Upon success, the returned promise will be fulfilled with the handle for the opened alert. condition elementIsDisabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be disabled. condition elementIsEnabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be enabled. condition elementIsNotVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be in the DOM, yet not visible to the user. condition elementIsVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become visible. condition elementIsSelected(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be selected. condition elementLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until an element is found with the given locator. condition elementsLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until at least one element is found with the given locator. condition elementTextContains(element: $driver.WebElement, substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to contain the given substring. condition elementTextIs(element: $driver.WebElement, text: string) Case sensitive. Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match the given text exactly. condition elementTextMatches(element: $driver.WebElement, regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match a regular expression. condition stalenessOf(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become stale. An element is considered stale once it is removed from the DOM, or a new page has loaded. condition titleContains(substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to contain the given substring. condition titleIs(title: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given value. condition titleMatches(regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given regular expression. condition For more help Additional documentation resources include: Writing scripted browsers (how to build WebDriverJS scripts for multi-step monitoring) Scripted browser examples (example code for scripted browsers, including comments, with examples like searching a website and waiting for results to load)",

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

      "body": "Use synthetic monitoring's API tests to monitor your API endpoint to ensure it is functioning correctly. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. Here we present some example functions showing how to use the $http object to submit your request. For detailed documentation on the options available for this object, see the http-request readme. Tip To view and share other API test examples, visit the synthetics scripts section in Explorers Hub. Use API http-request module API tests are powered by the http-request module, which is available through the $http object. Once each frequency interval, New Relic queries your endpoint from each of your selected locations. For instructions on creating a monitor, see Adding monitors. Read on to learn how to define metadata for your request, make a GET request, make a POST request, and how to validate the results. Important After a maximum run time of three minutes, New Relic manually stops the script. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: The script editor suggests functions, selectors, and other elements to simplify scripting commands (available in GitHub). Configure request options To start your script: Declare a variable (such as options) to store your request options object. Define request options such as the URL endpoint, and custom headers. If you're setting SSL or agent options, see SSL and agentOptions requirements. Tip For a full list of supported request options, see request(options, callback) in the http-request documentation on GitHub. Here's an example of optional metadata in the options object: Using optional metadata //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } }; Copy For SSL and agentOptions: If you are setting SSL options or providing an agentOptions object, the agent property in the request options object will need to be set to $globalAgents.https or $globalAgents.http to ensure your HTTP requests use the instrumented global agent. Here's an example of using a SSL option or agentOptions: Using a SSL option or agentOptions This example uses agentOptions: //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } //Specify global agent as the http agent agent: $globalAgents.https, //Set SSL option strictSSL: true, //Specify http agent options agentOptions: { ​maxVersion: 'TLSv1.1' }, }; Copy Send a GET request To make a GET request, use the $http.get method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.get, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights GET example This example queries the Insights API by using GET: //Define your authentication credentials var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myQueryKey = '{YOUR_QUERY_KEY}'; var options = { //Define endpoint URI uri: 'https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/'+myAccountID+'/query?nrql=SELECT%20average(amount)%20FROM%20SyntheticsEvent', //Define query key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback (err, response, body){ //Log JSON results from endpoint to Synthetics console. console.log(JSON.parse(body)); console.log('done with script'); } //Make GET request, passing in options and callback. $http.get(options,callback); Copy Send a POST request To make a POST request, use the $http.post method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.post, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Custom event POST example This example POSTs a custom event containing static integers to the Event API: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the 'assert' module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Verify endpoint returns 200 (OK) response code. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); //Parse JSON received from Insights into variable. var info = JSON.parse(body); //Verify that `info` contains element named `success` with a value of `true`. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); //Log end of script. console.log(\"End reached\"); } //Make POST request, passing in options and callback. $http.post(options, callback); Copy Validate results To validate your results, import the assert module to define your test case. Call an assert method to validate your endpoint's response. If any assert functions fail, the entire monitor will be considered a failed check. This may trigger alert notifications and affect your metrics. Important Synthetic monitoring does not allow thrown exceptions. Thrown exceptions result in script failure. Use the assert module to validate your results, and use console.log() to log results to the synthetic's console. Event API validation example This example POSTs to the Event API, then validates that the response is {\"success\":true}: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the `assert` module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; $http.post(options, function(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. The status code is logged before the `assert` function, //because a failed assert function ends the script. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Call `assert` method, expecting a `200` response code. //If assertion fails, log `Expected 200 OK response` as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); var info = JSON.parse(body); //Call `assert` method, expecting body to return `{\"success\":true}`. //If assertion fails, log `Expected True results in Response Body,` plus results as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); }); Copy",

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

      "body": "Use synthetic monitoring's API tests to monitor your API endpoint to ensure it is functioning correctly. New Relic uses the http-request module internally to make HTTP calls to your endpoint and validate the results. Here we present some example functions showing how to use the $http object to submit your request. For detailed documentation on the options available for this object, see the http-request readme. Tip To view and share other API test examples, visit the synthetics scripts section in Explorers Hub. Use API http-request module API tests are powered by the http-request module, which is available through the $http object. Once each frequency interval, New Relic queries your endpoint from each of your selected locations. For instructions on creating a monitor, see Adding monitors. Read on to learn how to define metadata for your request, make a GET request, make a POST request, and how to validate the results. Important After a maximum run time of three minutes, New Relic manually stops the script. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor: The script editor suggests functions, selectors, and other elements to simplify scripting commands (available in GitHub). Configure request options To start your script: Declare a variable (such as options) to store your request options object. Define request options such as the URL endpoint, and custom headers. If you're setting SSL or agent options, see SSL and agentOptions requirements. Tip For a full list of supported request options, see request(options, callback) in the http-request documentation on GitHub. Here's an example of optional metadata in the options object: Using optional metadata //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } }; Copy For SSL and agentOptions: If you are setting SSL options or providing an agentOptions object, the agent property in the request options object will need to be set to $globalAgents.https or $globalAgents.http to ensure your HTTP requests use the instrumented global agent. Here's an example of using a SSL option or agentOptions: Using a SSL option or agentOptions This example uses agentOptions: //Declare optional metadata var options = { //Specify the endpoint URL url: 'https://api-endpoint.example.com', //Specify optional headers headers: { 'Endpoint-Key': 'uqNTC57Phe72pnnB8JuJmwAr7b09nKSKSz', 'Additional-Header': 'Additional-Header-Data' } //Specify global agent as the http agent agent: $globalAgents.https, //Set SSL option strictSSL: true, //Specify http agent options agentOptions: { ​maxVersion: 'TLSv1.1' }, }; Copy Send a GET request To make a GET request, use the $http.get method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.get, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Insights GET example This example queries the Insights API by using GET: //Define your authentication credentials var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myQueryKey = '{YOUR_QUERY_KEY}'; var options = { //Define endpoint URI uri: 'https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/'+myAccountID+'/query?nrql=SELECT%20average(amount)%20FROM%20SyntheticsEvent', //Define query key and expected data type. headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback (err, response, body){ //Log JSON results from endpoint to Synthetics console. console.log(JSON.parse(body)); console.log('done with script'); } //Make GET request, passing in options and callback. $http.get(options,callback); Copy Send a POST request To make a POST request, use the $http.post method to submit your request. Define your request options, make your request using $http.post, then validate the response to ensure your endpoint is returning the correct results. Custom event POST example This example POSTs a custom event containing static integers to the Event API: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the 'assert' module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; //Define expected results using callback function. function callback(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Verify endpoint returns 200 (OK) response code. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); //Parse JSON received from Insights into variable. var info = JSON.parse(body); //Verify that `info` contains element named `success` with a value of `true`. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); //Log end of script. console.log(\"End reached\"); } //Make POST request, passing in options and callback. $http.post(options, callback); Copy Validate results To validate your results, import the assert module to define your test case. Call an assert method to validate your endpoint's response. If any assert functions fail, the entire monitor will be considered a failed check. This may trigger alert notifications and affect your metrics. Important Synthetic monitoring does not allow thrown exceptions. Thrown exceptions result in script failure. Use the assert module to validate your results, and use console.log() to log results to the synthetic's console. Event API validation example This example POSTs to the Event API, then validates that the response is {\"success\":true}: //Define your authentication credentials. var myAccountID = '{YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}'; var myLicenseKey = '{YOUR_LICENSE_KEY}'; //Import the `assert` module to validate results. var assert = require('assert'); var options = { //Define endpoint URL. url: \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/\"+myAccountID+\"/events\", //Define body of POST request. body: '[{\"eventType\":\"SyntheticsEvent\",\"integer1\":1000,\"integer2\":2000}]', //Define New Relic license key and expected data type. headers: { 'Api-Key': myLicenseKey, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }; $http.post(options, function(error, response, body) { //Log status code to Synthetics console. The status code is logged before the `assert` function, //because a failed assert function ends the script. console.log(response.statusCode + \" status code\") //Call `assert` method, expecting a `200` response code. //If assertion fails, log `Expected 200 OK response` as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(response.statusCode == 200, 'Expected 200 OK response'); var info = JSON.parse(body); //Call `assert` method, expecting body to return `{\"success\":true}`. //If assertion fails, log `Expected True results in Response Body,` plus results as error message to Synthetics console. assert.ok(info.success == true, 'Expected True results in Response Body, result was ' + info.success); }); Copy",

      "body": "This document is for synthetic monitor versions 0.4.x or lower. See also the documentation for Synthetic monitor versions 0.5 or higher. Overview Synthetic scripted browsers provide you access to the Selenium Webdriver APIs 2.47.0 via the variables $driver and $browser. In particular: $driver provides all the exports from the selenium-webdriver module (for example, ActionSequence, Button, By, WebElement, etc.). $browser is a synthetic-flavored instance of selenium-webdriver.WebDriver(): it exposes the main basic WebDriver APIs like get() and findElement(), as well as some synthetic custom APIs. This document describes the functions available for synthetic scripted browser monitors version 0.4.0 or lower. For the newest monitor documentation, see monitor version 0.5.0+ documentation. Other relevant documentation: For more on synthetic scripting, see Write scripted browsers. For example scripts, see Scripted browser examples. For more information about monitor versions and runtime differences, see Runtime environments. To view and share scripted browser examples, check out topics tagged synthetic-script in New Relic's Explorers Hub. Top-level functions: Build your script New Relic calls top-level functions directly from your $browser instance. These provide a wide range of functionality that covers many basic scriptable actions. Function Return value $browser.actions() Creates a new action sequence using this driver. For a list of available actions, see ActionSequence: Link multiple actions. void $browser.addHeader(headerKey: string, headerValue: string) Adds header headerKey with value headerValue to the runtime. void $browser.addHeaders(headers: ?) Adds a map of headers to the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeader(header: string) Deletes a specific header from the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeaders(header: [string]) Deletes all headers in argument from runtime. void $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist(hostname: string) Disallows a hostname. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnamesToBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Disallows all hostnames in an array of arguments. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnameToWhitelist(hostname: string) Allows a hostname blocked by default in synthetic monitoring. void $browser.addHostnamesToWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Allows all hostnames in argument. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromBlacklist(hostname: string) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's blacklist. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from the disallowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.executeAsyncScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute asynchronous JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.executeScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to find an element on the page. If not found, New Relic returns an error. WebElement $browser.findElements(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to search for multiple elements on the page. promise $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) Schedule a command to wait for and find an element on the page, and another command to wait for it to be visible. If not found, New Relic returns an error. The timeout value is an optional one, and gets applied separately to both tasks of finding the element and waiting for its visibility. This means at worst case, this method can take up to twice the provided timeout value. The default timeout value is 1000 ms (1 second). promise $browser.get(url: string) Loads a webpage in a synthetic browser. promise $browser.getAllWindowHandles() Schedules a command to retrieve the current list of available window handles. promise $browser.getCapabilities() A promise that will resolve with the instance's capabilities. promise $browser.getCurrentUrl() Schedules a command to retrieve the URL of the current page. promise $browser.getHeaders() Returns a map of currently configured headers. map $browser.getPageSource() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's source. The page source returned is a representation of the underlying DOM; do not expect it to be formatted or escaped in the same way as the response sent from the web server. promise $browser.getSession() A promise for this client's session. promise $browser.getTitle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's title. promise $browser.getWindowHandle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current window handle. promise $browser.isElementPresent(locatorOrElement: $driver.Locator) Schedules a command to test if an element is present on the page. If given a DOM element, this function will check if it belongs to the document the driver is currently focused on. Otherwise, the function will test if at least one element can be found with the given search criteria. promise $browser.manage() The options interface for this instance. You can manage cookies, timeouts, and other window options. void $browser.navigate() The navigation interface (history of browser functions) for this instance. void $browser.schedule(command: ?, description: string) Schedules a command to be executed by this driver's CommandExecutor. promise $browser.sleep() Schedules a command to make the driver sleep for the given amount of time. promise $browser.switchTo() The target locator interface for this instance. void $browser.takeScreenshot() Schedule a command to take a screenshot. promise $browser.wait(fn: $driver.until.Condition, timeout: number, opt_message: string) Schedules a command to wait for a condition to hold, as defined by some user supplied function. webElement $browser.waitForPendingRequests(timeout: number) Causes the script to wait for requests that have been initiated to return, up to the timeout. Useful for tracking non-blocking resources. promise Disallow list: Wildcard use Disallowing domains for your browser instance requires wildcards to match the URL syntax of the URL to be blocked. An overall .com disallowed list needs to contain these functions: Function Blocking action $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.com'); a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.com'); a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.*.com'); a.b.c.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.com'); www.a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.com'); www.a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.*.com'); www.a.b.c.com Options: Manage the browser instance These functions manage options for your browser instance such as cookies, timeouts and window size. Access these options through the $browser.manage() function. Function Return value $browser.manage().addCookie(name: string, value: string, opt_path: string, opt_domain: string, opt_isSecure: boolean, opt_expiry: number) Schedules a command to add a cookie. promise $browser.manage().deleteAllCookies() Schedules a command to delete all cookies visible to the current page. promise $browser.manage().deleteCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to delete the cookie with the given name. This command is a no-op if there is no cookie with the given name visible to the current page. promise $browser.manage().getCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to retrieve the cookie with the given name. Returns null if there is no such cookie. The cookie will be returned as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. promise $browser.manage().getCookies() Schedules a command to retrieve all cookies visible to the current page. New Relic Syntheticcs returns each cookie as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(ms: number) Specifies the amount of time the driver should wait when searching for an element if it is not immediately present. Setting the wait timeout to 0 disables implicit waiting. Be careful increasing the wait timeout, as it will increase test run time, especially with slower location strategies like XPath. Default is 10 seconds. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait for a page load to complete before returning an error. If the timeout is negative, page loads may last up to 180 seconds. Default is 60 seconds. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().setScriptTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait, in milliseconds, for an asynchronous script to finish execution before returning an error. Default is 30 seconds. promise $browser.manage().window().getPosition() Retrieves the window's current position, relative to the top left corner of the screen. promise $browser.manage().window().getSize() Retrieves the window's current size. promise $browser.manage().window().maximize() Maximizes the current window. promise $browser.manage().window().setPosition(x: number, y: number) Repositions the current window. promise $browser.manage().window().setSize(width: number, height: number) Resizes the current window. promise Locators: Find page elements Locators are a collection of factory functions for creating locator instances. Locators find DOM elements, which can be passed to functions such as $browser.findElement or $browser.isElementPresent. Call them through $driver.By. Function Return value $driver.By.className(className: string) Locates an element that has a specific class name. The returned locator is equivalent to searching for elements with the CSS selector .clazz. locator $driver.By.css(cssName: string) Locates an element using a CSS selector. locator $driver.By.id(id: string) Locates an element by its ID. locator $driver.By.linkText(linkText: string) Locates link elements whose visible text matches the given string. locator $driver.By.js(js: string) Locates an element by evaluating a JavaScript expression. locator $driver.By.name(name: string) Locates elements whose name attribute has the given value. locator $driver.By.partialLinkText(partialLinkText: string) Locates link elements whose getText visible contains the given substring. locator $driver.By.tagName(tagName: string) Locates elements with a given tag name. The returned locator is equivalent to using the getElementsByTagName DOM function. locator $driver.By.xpath(xpath: string) Locates elements matching a XPath selector. locator WebElement: Interact with page elements When a function such as $browser.findElement or $browser.waitForAndFindElement returns a WebElement reference, these functions can be used to interact with that element. Using these, you can click on buttons, sent text to form inputs, and get attributes of elements to test. Function Return value click() Clicks on this element. void sendKeys(var_args: ?) Schedules a command to type a sequence on the DOM element represented by this instance. WebElement getTagName() Schedules a command to query for the tag/node name of this element. WebElement getCssValue(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the computed style of the element represented by this instance. If the element inherits the named style from its parent, the parent will be queried for its value. Where possible, color values will be converted to their hex representation (for example, #00ff00 instead of rgb(0, 255, 0)). promise getAttribute(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the value of the given attribute of the element. promise getText(name: string) Get the visible (not hidden by CSS) innerText of this element, including sub-elements, without any leading or trailing white space. promise getSize() Schedules a command to compute the size of this element's bounding box, in pixels. promise getLocation() Schedules a command to compute the location of this element, in page space. promise isEnabled() Schedules a command to query whether the DOM element represented by this instance is enabled, as dictated by the disabled attribute. promise isSelected() Schedules a command to query whether this element is selected. promise submit() Schedules a command to submit the form containing this element (or this element if it is a FORM element). This command is a no-op if the element is not contained in a form. promise clear() Schedules a command to clear the value of this element. promise isDisplayed() Schedules a command to test whether this element is currently displayed. promise getOuterHtml() Schedules a command to retrieve the outer HTML of this element. promise getInnerHtml() Schedules a command to retrieve the inner HTML of this element. promise ActionSequence: Link multiple actions Action sequences can create complex user interactions with your website. To create a new action sequence, use $browser.actions(). To link multiple actions together into a sequence, include perform() after each. This executes and then terminates individual sequences, including single-action sequences. The following table contains a list of available actions. For more information, see the WebDriver ActionSequence documentation. Function Return value click(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. This is equivalent to WebElement.click(). actionsequence doubleClick(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Double-clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. actionsequence dragAndDrop(element: ?, location: ?) Convenience function for performing a \"drag and drop\" maneuver. The target element may be moved to the location of another element, or by an offset (in pixels). The location is an object with two properties x and y: {x: x_offset, y: y_offset}. actionsequence keyDown(key: ?) Performs a modifier key press. Must be one of ALT, CONTROL, SHIFT, COMMAND, or META. The modifier key is not released until keyUp() or sendKeys() is called. The key press will be targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence keyUp(key: ?) Performs a modifier key release. The release is targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence mouseDown(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Presses a mouse button. The mouse button will not be released until mouseUp is called, regardless of whether that call is made in this sequence or another. The behavior for out-of-order events (such as calling mouseDown() or click() when the button is already held down) is undefined. actionsequence mouseUp(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Releases a mouse button. Behavior is undefined for calling this function without a previous call to mouseDown(). actionsequence mouseMove(location: ?, offset: ?) Moves the mouse. The location to move to may be specified in terms of the mouse's current location, an offset relative to the top-left corner of an element, or an element (in which case the middle of the element is used). actionsequence perform() Executes this action sequence. promise sendKeys(args: ?) Simulates typing multiple keys. Each modifier key encountered in the sequence will not be released until it is encountered again. All key events will be targeted at the currently focused element. For a full list of supported non-alphanumeric keys, see the WebDriver enum key documentation. actionsequence Promises: Link actions into sequences You can also execute functions directly on promises. Synthetic monitoring is a native Node.js environment and uses standard Node.js promises. These functions evaluate the status of promises, cancel them, and more. In particular, you can create sequences of actions with the then() function and its siblings, thenFinally() and thenCatch(). For more information, see Sequence actions. Function Return value cancel(string: reason) Cancels the computation of this promise's value, rejecting the promise in the process. This method is a no-op if the promise has already been resolved. void isPending() Whether this promise's value is still being computed. boolean then(opt_callback: fn(T: ?), opt_errback: fn()) Registers listeners for when this instance is resolved. This is the basic function used to link synchronous actions in your script. promise thenFinally(callback: fn()) Registers a listener to invoke when this promise is resolved, regardless of whether the promise's value was successfully computed. promise thenCatch(callback: fn()) Registers a listener for when this promise is rejected. promise Navigate: Move through browser history The $browser.navigate() function exposes a number of functions that allow you to move backwards and forwards through your browser history, refresh your page and navigate to new pages. Function Return value back() Move back by one step in the browser's history. void forward() Move forward by one step in the browser's history. void refresh() Refresh the current page. void to(string: url) Load a new webpage in the current browser window. $browser.navigate().to() is equivalent to $browser.get(). void Conditions: Pause and wait for conditions Used with $browser.wait, until pauses your script execution until the condition is matched. For more information on explicit and implicit waits, see the WebDriver documentation. For .wait and .until usage examples, see Webdriver.wait examples. The following are available functions for $driver.until.Condition: Function Return value ableToSwitchToFrame(frame: ?) Creates a condition that will wait until the input driver is able to switch to the designated frame. The target frame may be specified as: A numeric index into window.frames for the current frame A webdriver.WebElement, which must reference a FRAME or IFRAME element on the current page A locator which may be used to first locate a FRAME or IFRAME on the current page before attempting to switch to it Upon successful resolution of this condition, the driver will be left focused on the new frame. condition alertIsPresent() Creates a condition that waits for an alert to be opened. Upon success, the returned promise will be fulfilled with the handle for the opened alert. condition elementIsDisabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be disabled. condition elementIsEnabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be enabled. condition elementIsNotVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be in the DOM, yet not visible to the user. condition elementIsVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become visible. condition elementIsSelected(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be selected. condition elementLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until an element is found with the given locator. condition elementsLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until at least one element is found with the given locator. condition elementTextContains(element: $driver.WebElement, substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to contain the given substring. condition elementTextIs(element: $driver.WebElement, text: string) Case sensitive. Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match the given text exactly. condition elementTextMatches(element: $driver.WebElement, regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match a regular expression. condition stalenessOf(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become stale. An element is considered stale once it is removed from the DOM, or a new page has loaded. condition titleContains(substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to contain the given substring. condition titleIs(title: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given value. condition titleMatches(regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given regular expression. condition For more help Additional documentation resources include: Writing scripted browsers (how to build WebDriverJS scripts for multi-step monitoring) Scripted browser examples (example code for scripted browsers, including comments, with examples like searching a website and waiting for results to load)",

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

      "body": "This document is for synthetic monitor versions 0.4.x or lower. See also the documentation for Synthetic monitor versions 0.5 or higher. Overview Synthetic scripted browsers provide you access to the Selenium Webdriver APIs 2.47.0 via the variables $driver and $browser. In particular: $driver provides all the exports from the selenium-webdriver module (for example, ActionSequence, Button, By, WebElement, etc.). $browser is a synthetic-flavored instance of selenium-webdriver.WebDriver(): it exposes the main basic WebDriver APIs like get() and findElement(), as well as some synthetic custom APIs. This document describes the functions available for synthetic scripted browser monitors version 0.4.0 or lower. For the newest monitor documentation, see monitor version 0.5.0+ documentation. Other relevant documentation: For more on synthetic scripting, see Write scripted browsers. For example scripts, see Scripted browser examples. For more information about monitor versions and runtime differences, see Runtime environments. To view and share scripted browser examples, check out topics tagged synthetic-script in New Relic's Explorers Hub. Top-level functions: Build your script New Relic calls top-level functions directly from your $browser instance. These provide a wide range of functionality that covers many basic scriptable actions. Function Return value $browser.actions() Creates a new action sequence using this driver. For a list of available actions, see ActionSequence: Link multiple actions. void $browser.addHeader(headerKey: string, headerValue: string) Adds header headerKey with value headerValue to the runtime. void $browser.addHeaders(headers: ?) Adds a map of headers to the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeader(header: string) Deletes a specific header from the runtime. void $browser.deleteHeaders(header: [string]) Deletes all headers in argument from runtime. void $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist(hostname: string) Disallows a hostname. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnamesToBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Disallows all hostnames in an array of arguments. Allows use wildcards. void $browser.addHostnameToWhitelist(hostname: string) Allows a hostname blocked by default in synthetic monitoring. void $browser.addHostnamesToWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Allows all hostnames in argument. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromBlacklist(hostname: string) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's blacklist. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromBlacklist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from the disallowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnameFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes a hostname from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.deleteHostnamesFromWhitelist(hostnameArr: [string]) Removes all hostnames in argument from this browser instance's allowed list. void $browser.executeAsyncScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute asynchronous JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.executeScript(script: ?, var_args: ?) Schedules a command to execute JavaScript in the context of the currently selected frame or window. promise $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to find an element on the page. If not found, New Relic returns an error. WebElement $browser.findElements(locator: $driver.Locator) Schedule a command to search for multiple elements on the page. promise $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) Schedule a command to wait for and find an element on the page, and another command to wait for it to be visible. If not found, New Relic returns an error. The timeout value is an optional one, and gets applied separately to both tasks of finding the element and waiting for its visibility. This means at worst case, this method can take up to twice the provided timeout value. The default timeout value is 1000 ms (1 second). promise $browser.get(url: string) Loads a webpage in a synthetic browser. promise $browser.getAllWindowHandles() Schedules a command to retrieve the current list of available window handles. promise $browser.getCapabilities() A promise that will resolve with the instance's capabilities. promise $browser.getCurrentUrl() Schedules a command to retrieve the URL of the current page. promise $browser.getHeaders() Returns a map of currently configured headers. map $browser.getPageSource() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's source. The page source returned is a representation of the underlying DOM; do not expect it to be formatted or escaped in the same way as the response sent from the web server. promise $browser.getSession() A promise for this client's session. promise $browser.getTitle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current page's title. promise $browser.getWindowHandle() Schedules a command to retrieve the current window handle. promise $browser.isElementPresent(locatorOrElement: $driver.Locator) Schedules a command to test if an element is present on the page. If given a DOM element, this function will check if it belongs to the document the driver is currently focused on. Otherwise, the function will test if at least one element can be found with the given search criteria. promise $browser.manage() The options interface for this instance. You can manage cookies, timeouts, and other window options. void $browser.navigate() The navigation interface (history of browser functions) for this instance. void $browser.schedule(command: ?, description: string) Schedules a command to be executed by this driver's CommandExecutor. promise $browser.sleep() Schedules a command to make the driver sleep for the given amount of time. promise $browser.switchTo() The target locator interface for this instance. void $browser.takeScreenshot() Schedule a command to take a screenshot. promise $browser.wait(fn: $driver.until.Condition, timeout: number, opt_message: string) Schedules a command to wait for a condition to hold, as defined by some user supplied function. webElement $browser.waitForPendingRequests(timeout: number) Causes the script to wait for requests that have been initiated to return, up to the timeout. Useful for tracking non-blocking resources. promise Disallow list: Wildcard use Disallowing domains for your browser instance requires wildcards to match the URL syntax of the URL to be blocked. An overall .com disallowed list needs to contain these functions: Function Blocking action $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.com'); a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.com'); a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('*.*.*.com'); a.b.c.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.com'); www.a.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.com'); www.a.b.com $browser.addHostnameToBlacklist('www.*.*.*.com'); www.a.b.c.com Options: Manage the browser instance These functions manage options for your browser instance such as cookies, timeouts and window size. Access these options through the $browser.manage() function. Function Return value $browser.manage().addCookie(name: string, value: string, opt_path: string, opt_domain: string, opt_isSecure: boolean, opt_expiry: number) Schedules a command to add a cookie. promise $browser.manage().deleteAllCookies() Schedules a command to delete all cookies visible to the current page. promise $browser.manage().deleteCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to delete the cookie with the given name. This command is a no-op if there is no cookie with the given name visible to the current page. promise $browser.manage().getCookie(name: string) Schedules a command to retrieve the cookie with the given name. Returns null if there is no such cookie. The cookie will be returned as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. promise $browser.manage().getCookies() Schedules a command to retrieve all cookies visible to the current page. New Relic Syntheticcs returns each cookie as a JSON object as described by the WebDriver wire protocol. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(ms: number) Specifies the amount of time the driver should wait when searching for an element if it is not immediately present. Setting the wait timeout to 0 disables implicit waiting. Be careful increasing the wait timeout, as it will increase test run time, especially with slower location strategies like XPath. Default is 10 seconds. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait for a page load to complete before returning an error. If the timeout is negative, page loads may last up to 180 seconds. Default is 60 seconds. promise $browser.manage().timeouts().setScriptTimeout(ms: number) Sets the amount of time to wait, in milliseconds, for an asynchronous script to finish execution before returning an error. Default is 30 seconds. promise $browser.manage().window().getPosition() Retrieves the window's current position, relative to the top left corner of the screen. promise $browser.manage().window().getSize() Retrieves the window's current size. promise $browser.manage().window().maximize() Maximizes the current window. promise $browser.manage().window().setPosition(x: number, y: number) Repositions the current window. promise $browser.manage().window().setSize(width: number, height: number) Resizes the current window. promise Locators: Find page elements Locators are a collection of factory functions for creating locator instances. Locators find DOM elements, which can be passed to functions such as $browser.findElement or $browser.isElementPresent. Call them through $driver.By. Function Return value $driver.By.className(className: string) Locates an element that has a specific class name. The returned locator is equivalent to searching for elements with the CSS selector .clazz. locator $driver.By.css(cssName: string) Locates an element using a CSS selector. locator $driver.By.id(id: string) Locates an element by its ID. locator $driver.By.linkText(linkText: string) Locates link elements whose visible text matches the given string. locator $driver.By.js(js: string) Locates an element by evaluating a JavaScript expression. locator $driver.By.name(name: string) Locates elements whose name attribute has the given value. locator $driver.By.partialLinkText(partialLinkText: string) Locates link elements whose getText visible contains the given substring. locator $driver.By.tagName(tagName: string) Locates elements with a given tag name. The returned locator is equivalent to using the getElementsByTagName DOM function. locator $driver.By.xpath(xpath: string) Locates elements matching a XPath selector. locator WebElement: Interact with page elements When a function such as $browser.findElement or $browser.waitForAndFindElement returns a WebElement reference, these functions can be used to interact with that element. Using these, you can click on buttons, sent text to form inputs, and get attributes of elements to test. Function Return value click() Clicks on this element. void sendKeys(var_args: ?) Schedules a command to type a sequence on the DOM element represented by this instance. WebElement getTagName() Schedules a command to query for the tag/node name of this element. WebElement getCssValue(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the computed style of the element represented by this instance. If the element inherits the named style from its parent, the parent will be queried for its value. Where possible, color values will be converted to their hex representation (for example, #00ff00 instead of rgb(0, 255, 0)). promise getAttribute(name: string) Schedules a command to query for the value of the given attribute of the element. promise getText(name: string) Get the visible (not hidden by CSS) innerText of this element, including sub-elements, without any leading or trailing white space. promise getSize() Schedules a command to compute the size of this element's bounding box, in pixels. promise getLocation() Schedules a command to compute the location of this element, in page space. promise isEnabled() Schedules a command to query whether the DOM element represented by this instance is enabled, as dictated by the disabled attribute. promise isSelected() Schedules a command to query whether this element is selected. promise submit() Schedules a command to submit the form containing this element (or this element if it is a FORM element). This command is a no-op if the element is not contained in a form. promise clear() Schedules a command to clear the value of this element. promise isDisplayed() Schedules a command to test whether this element is currently displayed. promise getOuterHtml() Schedules a command to retrieve the outer HTML of this element. promise getInnerHtml() Schedules a command to retrieve the inner HTML of this element. promise ActionSequence: Link multiple actions Action sequences can create complex user interactions with your website. To create a new action sequence, use $browser.actions(). To link multiple actions together into a sequence, include perform() after each. This executes and then terminates individual sequences, including single-action sequences. The following table contains a list of available actions. For more information, see the WebDriver ActionSequence documentation. Function Return value click(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. This is equivalent to WebElement.click(). actionsequence doubleClick(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Double-clicks a mouse button. If an element is provided, the mouse will first be moved to the center of that element. actionsequence dragAndDrop(element: ?, location: ?) Convenience function for performing a \"drag and drop\" maneuver. The target element may be moved to the location of another element, or by an offset (in pixels). The location is an object with two properties x and y: {x: x_offset, y: y_offset}. actionsequence keyDown(key: ?) Performs a modifier key press. Must be one of ALT, CONTROL, SHIFT, COMMAND, or META. The modifier key is not released until keyUp() or sendKeys() is called. The key press will be targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence keyUp(key: ?) Performs a modifier key release. The release is targeted at the currently focused element. actionsequence mouseDown(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Presses a mouse button. The mouse button will not be released until mouseUp is called, regardless of whether that call is made in this sequence or another. The behavior for out-of-order events (such as calling mouseDown() or click() when the button is already held down) is undefined. actionsequence mouseUp(opt_elementOrButton: ?, opt_button: ?) Releases a mouse button. Behavior is undefined for calling this function without a previous call to mouseDown(). actionsequence mouseMove(location: ?, offset: ?) Moves the mouse. The location to move to may be specified in terms of the mouse's current location, an offset relative to the top-left corner of an element, or an element (in which case the middle of the element is used). actionsequence perform() Executes this action sequence. promise sendKeys(args: ?) Simulates typing multiple keys. Each modifier key encountered in the sequence will not be released until it is encountered again. All key events will be targeted at the currently focused element. For a full list of supported non-alphanumeric keys, see the WebDriver enum key documentation. actionsequence Promises: Link actions into sequences You can also execute functions directly on promises. Synthetic monitoring is a native Node.js environment and uses standard Node.js promises. These functions evaluate the status of promises, cancel them, and more. In particular, you can create sequences of actions with the then() function and its siblings, thenFinally() and thenCatch(). For more information, see Sequence actions. Function Return value cancel(string: reason) Cancels the computation of this promise's value, rejecting the promise in the process. This method is a no-op if the promise has already been resolved. void isPending() Whether this promise's value is still being computed. boolean then(opt_callback: fn(T: ?), opt_errback: fn()) Registers listeners for when this instance is resolved. This is the basic function used to link synchronous actions in your script. promise thenFinally(callback: fn()) Registers a listener to invoke when this promise is resolved, regardless of whether the promise's value was successfully computed. promise thenCatch(callback: fn()) Registers a listener for when this promise is rejected. promise Navigate: Move through browser history The $browser.navigate() function exposes a number of functions that allow you to move backwards and forwards through your browser history, refresh your page and navigate to new pages. Function Return value back() Move back by one step in the browser's history. void forward() Move forward by one step in the browser's history. void refresh() Refresh the current page. void to(string: url) Load a new webpage in the current browser window. $browser.navigate().to() is equivalent to $browser.get(). void Conditions: Pause and wait for conditions Used with $browser.wait, until pauses your script execution until the condition is matched. For more information on explicit and implicit waits, see the WebDriver documentation. For .wait and .until usage examples, see Webdriver.wait examples. The following are available functions for $driver.until.Condition: Function Return value ableToSwitchToFrame(frame: ?) Creates a condition that will wait until the input driver is able to switch to the designated frame. The target frame may be specified as: A numeric index into window.frames for the current frame A webdriver.WebElement, which must reference a FRAME or IFRAME element on the current page A locator which may be used to first locate a FRAME or IFRAME on the current page before attempting to switch to it Upon successful resolution of this condition, the driver will be left focused on the new frame. condition alertIsPresent() Creates a condition that waits for an alert to be opened. Upon success, the returned promise will be fulfilled with the handle for the opened alert. condition elementIsDisabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be disabled. condition elementIsEnabled(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be enabled. condition elementIsNotVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be in the DOM, yet not visible to the user. condition elementIsVisible(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become visible. condition elementIsSelected(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to be selected. condition elementLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until an element is found with the given locator. condition elementsLocated(element: $driver.Locator) Creates a condition that will loop until at least one element is found with the given locator. condition elementTextContains(element: $driver.WebElement, substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to contain the given substring. condition elementTextIs(element: $driver.WebElement, text: string) Case sensitive. Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match the given text exactly. condition elementTextMatches(element: $driver.WebElement, regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element's visible text to match a regular expression. condition stalenessOf(element: $driver.WebElement) Creates a condition that will wait for the given element to become stale. An element is considered stale once it is removed from the DOM, or a new page has loaded. condition titleContains(substr: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to contain the given substring. condition titleIs(title: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given value. condition titleMatches(regex: string) Creates a condition that will wait for the current page's title to match the given regular expression. condition For more help Additional documentation resources include: Writing scripted browsers (how to build WebDriverJS scripts for multi-step monitoring) Scripted browser examples (example code for scripted browsers, including comments, with examples like searching a website and waiting for results to load)",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. New Relic's $util.insights is a set of tools to set and manipulate events reported from synthetic monitoring. The $util.insights toolset includes the word insights because Insights was historically how New Relic saved queryable event data. You can add custom data as custom attributes, with the prefix custom, to the SyntheticCheck event. These attributes are in addition to the event's default attributes. Compatibility This functionality is available for monitor versions 0.2.0 or later. Functions Function Return value $util.insights.set(key: string, value: ?) Sets a key/value pair. void $util.insights.get(key: string) Returns the value for the provided key. object $util.insights.getKeys() Returns an array of keys currently set. object $util.insights.has(key: string) Returns true if the key exists in the data. boolean $util.insights.unset(key: string) Removes the key/value pair. void $util.insights.unsetAll() Removes all custom data. void Example The example obtains the latest incident from New Relic's RSS status feed and saves the details for this event. var parseString = require('xml2js').parseString; // Get the New Relic status RSS feed $http.get('https://status.newrelic.com/history.rss', function(err, response, body) { parseString(body, function(err, result){ // Parse the RSS, and get the latest incident var latestIncident = result.rss.channel[0].item[0]; // Push the incident details to New Relic $util.insights.set('Incident', latestIncident.title[0]); $util.insights.set('Description', latestIncident.description[0]); $util.insights.set('Date', latestIncident.pubDate[0]); }); }); Copy To view the incident data sent to New Relic in this example, use this query: FROM SyntheticCheck SELECT latest(custom.Date), latest(custom.Incident), latest(custom.Description) WHERE monitorName = \"Monitor Name Here\" Copy",

You can also view SLA reports for individual monitors: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > SLA. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report: Use SLA reports to understand your monitors' performance over time. Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

You can customize your Apdex T target for individual monitors by editing your monitor. Change the time frame Choose from daily, weekly, or monthly aggregation by selecting the appropriate tab. Make the report public Change the Public SLA setting to ON to allow non-authenticated users to view the report. Select Share Report to get the public URL to share. Generate SLA values The values in the SLA report are generated from Insights queries against the available synthetic monitoring data. You can easily recreate these values and modify the queries to meet your needs. This query returns the average duration, the apdex, and the uptime. Substitute your values for the variables highlighted and described below. SELECT average(duration), apdex(duration, t:), percentage(count(*), WHERE result='SUCCESS') FROM SyntheticCheck FACET timeperiod Copy Variable Value t: Supply the Apdex T that you would like to calculate your apdex against. The duration attribute in the SyntheticCheck event is stored in milliseconds, so an Apdex T value of 7 seconds should be included as 7000. timeperiod This is the period that you would like to calculate on. For a daily report, facet on dateOf(timestamp), for a weekly report facet on weekOf(timestamp) and for a monthly report facet on monthOf(timestamp). NRQL queries default to querying against the last hour of data. In order to widen the scope of your data you will need to include a SINCE clause at the end of your query.

Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

      "body": "Problem Your New Relic's synthetic Simple, Scripted, or Scripted API (non-ping) monitor reported an error, but the application appears to have loaded correctly. For ping and simple monitor errors, see non-scripted monitor errors. Solutions Below are some of the most common non-ping monitor error messages. Simple or scripted browser errors Element A is not clickable at point (X, Y). Other element would receive the click: Element B Problem The synthetic script is attempting to .click() an element (Element A) at point (X,Y), but another element (Element B) is obscuring the target element. Solution Set a custom wait time, allowing time for a specific condition to be met. In this case, until the loading animation is no longer visible: .then(function() { return $browser.wait($driver.until.elementIsNotVisible($browser.findElement($driver.By.id('LOADING'))), 10000); }) Copy Alternatively, you can set a custom sleep delay using $browser.sleep(sleeptime_ms), stalling script execution for a specified amount of time. As this is a fixed amount of wait-time, which does not account for increased network latency or degraded site performance, we recommend using the .wait() function instead. Tip This will not correct .click() issues caused by sticky headers or footers. In these instances, you may need to scroll manually to bring the target into view. Cause This happens if the target element, at the time of the .click() function, is obscured by: A loading overlay, modal, or pop-up An animation that reveals the target element A sticky header or footer Error: element not visible Problem The targeted element is not visible to the Selenium WebDriver. Solution Verify that the targeted element does not have the CSS properties of display: none or visibility: hidden applied. Cause Any element that has a CSS property of display: none or visibility: hidden will not be found by the Selenium WebDriver, as the script will only look for elements that are actually visible to a user. Error: no such element: Unable to locate element: <LOCATOR> Problem The Selenium WebDriver was unable to find this element in the visible DOM. Solution To resolve this problem: Confirm that the element locator being used for the target element is accurate. Avoid using By.XPath where possible as it is rigidly tied to the page’s DOM structure, and can easily become out-of-date when there are updates on the page. If element is in an iframe, use $browser.switchTo().frame(<index or element reference>. Tip See the Selenium documentation for more information on switchTo() and TargetLocator() functions. Cause Common reasons for this error include: The targeted element is unable to be located by functions such as: $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) or $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [ , timeout: number This may be due to a timing issue. For example, the WebDriver is attempting to locate the element before the page has been loaded. Element is in an iframe, which is a separate document context. JobTimeoutError: Job timed-out after 180s Problem The scripted monitor run reached the 180 second non-configurable timeout threshold, and the run was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assign the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. NetworkError: Monitor produced no traffic Problem The API test or scripted browser monitor appears to be running but is returning this error. Solution Ensure that $http.get() or $browser.get() are being called appropriately and are generating traffic. For Scripted API monitors, if you are using a request option to spin up an un-instrumented HTTP agent under the hood, specify one of our instrumented HTTP agents using either of the agent request options below: $globalAgents.http $globalAgents.https Example: var options = { uri: 'https://www.newrelic.com', agent: $globalAgents.https, agentOptions: { 'rejectUnauthorized': false }, strictSSL: false }; function callback(err, res, body) { ... }; $http.get(options, callback); Copy Cause This occurs in scripted monitor runs when the HTTP client ($http in scripted api monitors) or Chrome browser ($browser in scripted browser monitors) is not used to generate HTTP traffic. In some cases, certain request options in API monitors may force a new HTTP agent, one that is not instrumented by synthetic monitoring, to be used to collect HTTP traffic. ReferenceError: $network is not defined Problem The $network object used for setting monitor proxies is not available for that monitor’s runtime. Solution If your monitor was created before the 0.4.0 runtime release, create a new monitor to take advantage of the latest runtime. Your monitor’s current runtime version is shown at the top of the monitor's settings. For more information, see Scripted monitor version runtime environments. Cause This error occurs when attempting to use $network on a monitor with a runtime at or below 0.2.2. Proxying monitor traffic was introduced in monitor runtime version 0.4.0, causing this method to be evaluated as undefined on earlier monitor runtimes. ScriptTimeoutError Problem This error indicates that the job has reached the Docker container timeout threshold, and the script was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assigned the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. StaleElementReferenceError: element is not attached to the page document Problem The target page has loaded, but there was a change to an element between the execution of an element locator and an action being executed on the element. Solution Set your scripted browser to wait until the page is settled before performing a findElement() action. This can be accomplished by setting a custom wait time, using the $browser.wait(fn, timeout) function prior to the findElement call, to wait for a condition that indicates a settled page state. This will make it less likely for DOM manipulation to cause a reference to go stale. Alternatively, you can set a custom sleep delay using $browser.sleep(sleeptime_ms), stalling script execution for a specified amount of time. As this is a fixed amount of wait-time, which does not account for increased network latency or degraded site performance, we recommend using the .wait() function instead. Cause This error typically happens when the script attempts to .click() an element after using either the findElement() or waitForAndFindElement() function. If the DOM has changed between when the element locator was generated and the action was executed against the element, this error will occur because the actual element has changed. For example: the findElement() function is used to generate an element reference while the page’s script is actively manipulating the DOM. The DOM is then changed, causing the previously generated reference to become stale. The now out-of-date reference is used in an attempt to perform a .click() action, resulting in this monitor failure. Tip For more information, see the Selenium documentation on Stale Element Reference Exceptions. TaskTimedOut: task timed-out waiting for element to be located using: <LOCATOR> Problem The waitForAndFindElement(<locator>, <timeout>) function failed to locate an element within the provided timeout. Solution Confirm that the element locator being used for the target element is accurate. Avoid using By.XPath() where possible, as it is rigidly tied to the page’s DOM structure and can easily become out-of-date when there are updates on the page. Cause The target element did not exist on the page when the waitForAndFindElement(<locator>, <timeout>) function was called. This may be caused by the target page not being in the expected state. Common reasons for this error include: There is a legitimate issue with the target site. The element locator being used is incorrect. The target site has changed, requiring the revision of the Synthetics script. The previous action in the script did not successfully complete, causing the page to be in an unexpected state when the subsequent waitForAndFindElement() call was initiated. TimeoutError: Page load timed-out (unable to finish all network requests on time) Problem The target page loaded successfully, but returned the error: TimeoutError: Page load timed-out (unable to finish all network requests on time) Solution If the failures began suddenly, investigate any requests that could be blocking or delaying the page load event. If you are unsure which request is causing the error, use the timeline view to identify any long running HTTP requests. If the page is frequently unable to fully load within the current timeout, set a custom page load timeout using the $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) function. Cause The target page loaded successfully, but the page load event was not fired within the page load timeout set in the .pageLoadTimeout() function. There are a number of reasons you could see this error message, including: A blocked resource request on the page held up the page load. A resource request processed slower than normal due to an underlying network issue. A dependent resource on the page blocked the iframe load event. TypeError: $browser.isElementPresent is not a function Problem The function isElementPresent(), used by Synthetics monitors with a runtime >= 0.5.0, has been deprecated in Selenium 3. Solution To continue to use this function after depreciation you will need to create a custom version of this function, such as: return $browser.findElements(ele).then(function(found) { return found.length > 0; }); } Copy Example usage, which would return true: $browser .get(\"https://www.newrelic.com\") .then(function() { return isElementPresent($driver.By.id(\"nav_signup\")); }) .then(function(found) { return console.log(found); }); Copy Cause This can occur when attempting to use a scripted browser monitor script from an older monitor ( < = 0.4.1 runtime) with a newer monitor ( >= 0.5.0) runtime. Scripted API monitor errors JobTimeoutError: Job timed-out after 180s Problem The scripted monitor run reached the 180 second non-configurable timeout threshold, and the run was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assign the task its own configurable timeout.

In some cases, certain request options in API monitors may force a new HTTP agent, one that is not instrumented by Synthetics, to be used to collect HTTP traffic. ReferenceError: $network is not defined Problem The $network object used for setting monitor proxies is not available for that monitor’s runtime. Solution If your monitor was created before the 0.4.0 runtime release, create a new monitor to take advantage of the latest runtime. Your monitor’s current runtime version is shown at the top of the Monitor Settings page. For more information, see Scripted monitor version runtime environments. Cause This error occurs when attempting to use $network on a monitor with a runtime at or below 0.2.2. Proxying monitor traffic was introduced in monitor runtime version 0.4.0, causing this method to be evaluated as undefined on earlier monitor runtimes. ScriptTimeoutError Problem This error indicates that the job has reached the Docker container timeout threshold, and the script was terminated.

If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. SyntaxError: Unexpected token < Problem JSON.parse() was passed a string that begins with the < character and is likely HTML, instead of JSON. Solution Ensure the target endpoint is returning the expected response body. You can do this by logging the response body in the callback, before attempting to parse. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } console.log(body); // Log HTML response body, don't parse as JSON }); Copy Depending on the target API endpoint, you may need to include specific request headers to ensure that JSON is returned. Cause The script is attempting to use JSON.parse() on a response body after a request is made and is expecting the endpoint to return JSON, but HTML was returned instead. SyntaxError: Unexpected token u in JSON at position 0 Problem JSON.parse() was passed an undefined parameter, but expected a JSON string. Solution Troubleshoot the cause of the request error. Details on what is causing request errors can be found in the error object passed to the request callback function. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } var bodyJson = JSON.parse(body); console.log(bodyJson); // Log response body }); Copy Cause This can occur in Scripted API monitors when a performing an API request, then attempting to parse the request response within the callback function. The response body is passed to JSON.parse() without checking if the response body is undefined first. An undefined response body is often caused by a request error. If there is no error handling to prevent code that parses the response body, this monitor failure will occur. TypeError: Cannot read property 'statusCode' of undefined Problem The response object (and thus response.statusCode) in an API request callback is undefined. Solution Troubleshoot the cause of the request error. Details on what is causing request errors can be found in the error object passed to the request callback function. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } console.log(response.statusCode); }); Copy Cause This error occurs when there was an error completing the API request (for example, unable to reach server, unable to resolve DNS). In these instances, the request was not completed so the response object in the callback function arguments is undefined. If there is no error handling to prevent code that checks response status code, this monitor failure will occur.",

Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

      "body": "Problem Your New Relic's synthetic Simple, Scripted, or Scripted API (non-ping) monitor reported an error, but the application appears to have loaded correctly. For ping and simple monitor errors, see non-scripted monitor errors. Solutions Below are some of the most common non-ping monitor error messages. Simple or scripted browser errors Element A is not clickable at point (X, Y). Other element would receive the click: Element B Problem The synthetic script is attempting to .click() an element (Element A) at point (X,Y), but another element (Element B) is obscuring the target element. Solution Set a custom wait time, allowing time for a specific condition to be met. In this case, until the loading animation is no longer visible: .then(function() { return $browser.wait($driver.until.elementIsNotVisible($browser.findElement($driver.By.id('LOADING'))), 10000); }) Copy Alternatively, you can set a custom sleep delay using $browser.sleep(sleeptime_ms), stalling script execution for a specified amount of time. As this is a fixed amount of wait-time, which does not account for increased network latency or degraded site performance, we recommend using the .wait() function instead. Tip This will not correct .click() issues caused by sticky headers or footers. In these instances, you may need to scroll manually to bring the target into view. Cause This happens if the target element, at the time of the .click() function, is obscured by: A loading overlay, modal, or pop-up An animation that reveals the target element A sticky header or footer Error: element not visible Problem The targeted element is not visible to the Selenium WebDriver. Solution Verify that the targeted element does not have the CSS properties of display: none or visibility: hidden applied. Cause Any element that has a CSS property of display: none or visibility: hidden will not be found by the Selenium WebDriver, as the script will only look for elements that are actually visible to a user. Error: no such element: Unable to locate element: <LOCATOR> Problem The Selenium WebDriver was unable to find this element in the visible DOM. Solution To resolve this problem: Confirm that the element locator being used for the target element is accurate. Avoid using By.XPath where possible as it is rigidly tied to the page’s DOM structure, and can easily become out-of-date when there are updates on the page. If element is in an iframe, use $browser.switchTo().frame(<index or element reference>. Tip See the Selenium documentation for more information on switchTo() and TargetLocator() functions. Cause Common reasons for this error include: The targeted element is unable to be located by functions such as: $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) or $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [ , timeout: number This may be due to a timing issue. For example, the WebDriver is attempting to locate the element before the page has been loaded. Element is in an iframe, which is a separate document context. JobTimeoutError: Job timed-out after 180s Problem The scripted monitor run reached the 180 second non-configurable timeout threshold, and the run was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assign the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. NetworkError: Monitor produced no traffic Problem The API test or scripted browser monitor appears to be running but is returning this error. Solution Ensure that $http.get() or $browser.get() are being called appropriately and are generating traffic. For Scripted API monitors, if you are using a request option to spin up an un-instrumented HTTP agent under the hood, specify one of our instrumented HTTP agents using either of the agent request options below: $globalAgents.http $globalAgents.https Example: var options = { uri: 'https://www.newrelic.com', agent: $globalAgents.https, agentOptions: { 'rejectUnauthorized': false }, strictSSL: false }; function callback(err, res, body) { ... }; $http.get(options, callback); Copy Cause This occurs in scripted monitor runs when the HTTP client ($http in scripted api monitors) or Chrome browser ($browser in scripted browser monitors) is not used to generate HTTP traffic. In some cases, certain request options in API monitors may force a new HTTP agent, one that is not instrumented by synthetic monitoring, to be used to collect HTTP traffic. ReferenceError: $network is not defined Problem The $network object used for setting monitor proxies is not available for that monitor’s runtime. Solution If your monitor was created before the 0.4.0 runtime release, create a new monitor to take advantage of the latest runtime. Your monitor’s current runtime version is shown at the top of the monitor's settings. For more information, see Scripted monitor version runtime environments. Cause This error occurs when attempting to use $network on a monitor with a runtime at or below 0.2.2. Proxying monitor traffic was introduced in monitor runtime version 0.4.0, causing this method to be evaluated as undefined on earlier monitor runtimes. ScriptTimeoutError Problem This error indicates that the job has reached the Docker container timeout threshold, and the script was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assigned the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. StaleElementReferenceError: element is not attached to the page document Problem The target page has loaded, but there was a change to an element between the execution of an element locator and an action being executed on the element. Solution Set your scripted browser to wait until the page is settled before performing a findElement() action. This can be accomplished by setting a custom wait time, using the $browser.wait(fn, timeout) function prior to the findElement call, to wait for a condition that indicates a settled page state. This will make it less likely for DOM manipulation to cause a reference to go stale. Alternatively, you can set a custom sleep delay using $browser.sleep(sleeptime_ms), stalling script execution for a specified amount of time. As this is a fixed amount of wait-time, which does not account for increased network latency or degraded site performance, we recommend using the .wait() function instead. Cause This error typically happens when the script attempts to .click() an element after using either the findElement() or waitForAndFindElement() function. If the DOM has changed between when the element locator was generated and the action was executed against the element, this error will occur because the actual element has changed. For example: the findElement() function is used to generate an element reference while the page’s script is actively manipulating the DOM. The DOM is then changed, causing the previously generated reference to become stale. The now out-of-date reference is used in an attempt to perform a .click() action, resulting in this monitor failure. Tip For more information, see the Selenium documentation on Stale Element Reference Exceptions. TaskTimedOut: task timed-out waiting for element to be located using: <LOCATOR> Problem The waitForAndFindElement(<locator>, <timeout>) function failed to locate an element within the provided timeout. Solution Confirm that the element locator being used for the target element is accurate. Avoid using By.XPath() where possible, as it is rigidly tied to the page’s DOM structure and can easily become out-of-date when there are updates on the page. Cause The target element did not exist on the page when the waitForAndFindElement(<locator>, <timeout>) function was called. This may be caused by the target page not being in the expected state. Common reasons for this error include: There is a legitimate issue with the target site. The element locator being used is incorrect. The target site has changed, requiring the revision of the Synthetics script. The previous action in the script did not successfully complete, causing the page to be in an unexpected state when the subsequent waitForAndFindElement() call was initiated. TimeoutError: Page load timed-out (unable to finish all network requests on time) Problem The target page loaded successfully, but returned the error: TimeoutError: Page load timed-out (unable to finish all network requests on time) Solution If the failures began suddenly, investigate any requests that could be blocking or delaying the page load event. If you are unsure which request is causing the error, use the timeline view to identify any long running HTTP requests. If the page is frequently unable to fully load within the current timeout, set a custom page load timeout using the $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) function. Cause The target page loaded successfully, but the page load event was not fired within the page load timeout set in the .pageLoadTimeout() function. There are a number of reasons you could see this error message, including: A blocked resource request on the page held up the page load. A resource request processed slower than normal due to an underlying network issue. A dependent resource on the page blocked the iframe load event. TypeError: $browser.isElementPresent is not a function Problem The function isElementPresent(), used by Synthetics monitors with a runtime >= 0.5.0, has been deprecated in Selenium 3. Solution To continue to use this function after depreciation you will need to create a custom version of this function, such as: return $browser.findElements(ele).then(function(found) { return found.length > 0; }); } Copy Example usage, which would return true: $browser .get(\"https://www.newrelic.com\") .then(function() { return isElementPresent($driver.By.id(\"nav_signup\")); }) .then(function(found) { return console.log(found); }); Copy Cause This can occur when attempting to use a scripted browser monitor script from an older monitor ( < = 0.4.1 runtime) with a newer monitor ( >= 0.5.0) runtime. Scripted API monitor errors JobTimeoutError: Job timed-out after 180s Problem The scripted monitor run reached the 180 second non-configurable timeout threshold, and the run was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assign the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. NetworkError: Monitor produced no traffic Problem The API test or scripted browser monitor appears to be running but is returning this error. Solution Ensure that $http.get() or $browser.get() are being called appropriately and are generating traffic. For Scripted API monitors, if you are using a request option to spin up an un-instrumented HTTP agent under the hood, specify one of our instrumented HTTP agents using either of the agent request options below: $globalAgents.http $globalAgents.https Example: var options = { uri: 'https://www.newrelic.com', agent: $globalAgents.https, agentOptions: { 'rejectUnauthorized': false }, strictSSL: false }; function callback(err, res, body) { ... }; $http.get(options, callback); Copy Cause This occurs in scripted monitor runs when the HTTP client ($http in scripted api monitors) or Chrome browser ($browser in scripted browser monitors) is not used to generate HTTP traffic. In some cases, certain request options in API monitors may force a new HTTP agent, one that is not instrumented by Synthetics, to be used to collect HTTP traffic. ReferenceError: $network is not defined Problem The $network object used for setting monitor proxies is not available for that monitor’s runtime. Solution If your monitor was created before the 0.4.0 runtime release, create a new monitor to take advantage of the latest runtime. Your monitor’s current runtime version is shown at the top of the Monitor Settings page. For more information, see Scripted monitor version runtime environments. Cause This error occurs when attempting to use $network on a monitor with a runtime at or below 0.2.2. Proxying monitor traffic was introduced in monitor runtime version 0.4.0, causing this method to be evaluated as undefined on earlier monitor runtimes. ScriptTimeoutError Problem This error indicates that the job has reached the Docker container timeout threshold, and the script was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assigned the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. SyntaxError: Unexpected token < Problem JSON.parse() was passed a string that begins with the < character and is likely HTML, instead of JSON. Solution Ensure the target endpoint is returning the expected response body. You can do this by logging the response body in the callback, before attempting to parse. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } console.log(body); // Log HTML response body, don't parse as JSON }); Copy Depending on the target API endpoint, you may need to include specific request headers to ensure that JSON is returned. Cause The script is attempting to use JSON.parse() on a response body after a request is made and is expecting the endpoint to return JSON, but HTML was returned instead. SyntaxError: Unexpected token u in JSON at position 0 Problem JSON.parse() was passed an undefined parameter, but expected a JSON string. Solution Troubleshoot the cause of the request error. Details on what is causing request errors can be found in the error object passed to the request callback function. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } var bodyJson = JSON.parse(body); console.log(bodyJson); // Log response body }); Copy Cause This can occur in Scripted API monitors when a performing an API request, then attempting to parse the request response within the callback function. The response body is passed to JSON.parse() without checking if the response body is undefined first. An undefined response body is often caused by a request error. If there is no error handling to prevent code that parses the response body, this monitor failure will occur. TypeError: Cannot read property 'statusCode' of undefined Problem The response object (and thus response.statusCode) in an API request callback is undefined. Solution Troubleshoot the cause of the request error. Details on what is causing request errors can be found in the error object passed to the request callback function. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } console.log(response.statusCode); }); Copy Cause This error occurs when there was an error completing the API request (for example, unable to reach server, unable to resolve DNS). In these instances, the request was not completed so the response object in the callback function arguments is undefined. If there is no error handling to prevent code that checks response status code, this monitor failure will occur.",

Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

      "body": "Problem Your New Relic's synthetic Simple, Scripted, or Scripted API (non-ping) monitor reported an error, but the application appears to have loaded correctly. For ping and simple monitor errors, see non-scripted monitor errors. Solutions Below are some of the most common non-ping monitor error messages. Simple or scripted browser errors Element A is not clickable at point (X, Y). Other element would receive the click: Element B Problem The synthetic script is attempting to .click() an element (Element A) at point (X,Y), but another element (Element B) is obscuring the target element. Solution Set a custom wait time, allowing time for a specific condition to be met. In this case, until the loading animation is no longer visible: .then(function() { return $browser.wait($driver.until.elementIsNotVisible($browser.findElement($driver.By.id('LOADING'))), 10000); }) Copy Alternatively, you can set a custom sleep delay using $browser.sleep(sleeptime_ms), stalling script execution for a specified amount of time. As this is a fixed amount of wait-time, which does not account for increased network latency or degraded site performance, we recommend using the .wait() function instead. Tip This will not correct .click() issues caused by sticky headers or footers. In these instances, you may need to scroll manually to bring the target into view. Cause This happens if the target element, at the time of the .click() function, is obscured by: A loading overlay, modal, or pop-up An animation that reveals the target element A sticky header or footer Error: element not visible Problem The targeted element is not visible to the Selenium WebDriver. Solution Verify that the targeted element does not have the CSS properties of display: none or visibility: hidden applied. Cause Any element that has a CSS property of display: none or visibility: hidden will not be found by the Selenium WebDriver, as the script will only look for elements that are actually visible to a user. Error: no such element: Unable to locate element: <LOCATOR> Problem The Selenium WebDriver was unable to find this element in the visible DOM. Solution To resolve this problem: Confirm that the element locator being used for the target element is accurate. Avoid using By.XPath where possible as it is rigidly tied to the page’s DOM structure, and can easily become out-of-date when there are updates on the page. If element is in an iframe, use $browser.switchTo().frame(<index or element reference>. Tip See the Selenium documentation for more information on switchTo() and TargetLocator() functions. Cause Common reasons for this error include: The targeted element is unable to be located by functions such as: $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) or $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [ , timeout: number This may be due to a timing issue. For example, the WebDriver is attempting to locate the element before the page has been loaded. Element is in an iframe, which is a separate document context. JobTimeoutError: Job timed-out after 180s Problem The scripted monitor run reached the 180 second non-configurable timeout threshold, and the run was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assign the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. NetworkError: Monitor produced no traffic Problem The API test or scripted browser monitor appears to be running but is returning this error. Solution Ensure that $http.get() or $browser.get() are being called appropriately and are generating traffic. For Scripted API monitors, if you are using a request option to spin up an un-instrumented HTTP agent under the hood, specify one of our instrumented HTTP agents using either of the agent request options below: $globalAgents.http $globalAgents.https Example: var options = { uri: 'https://www.newrelic.com', agent: $globalAgents.https, agentOptions: { 'rejectUnauthorized': false }, strictSSL: false }; function callback(err, res, body) { ... }; $http.get(options, callback); Copy Cause This occurs in scripted monitor runs when the HTTP client ($http in scripted api monitors) or Chrome browser ($browser in scripted browser monitors) is not used to generate HTTP traffic. In some cases, certain request options in API monitors may force a new HTTP agent, one that is not instrumented by synthetic monitoring, to be used to collect HTTP traffic. ReferenceError: $network is not defined Problem The $network object used for setting monitor proxies is not available for that monitor’s runtime. Solution If your monitor was created before the 0.4.0 runtime release, create a new monitor to take advantage of the latest runtime. Your monitor’s current runtime version is shown at the top of the monitor's settings. For more information, see Scripted monitor version runtime environments. Cause This error occurs when attempting to use $network on a monitor with a runtime at or below 0.2.2. Proxying monitor traffic was introduced in monitor runtime version 0.4.0, causing this method to be evaluated as undefined on earlier monitor runtimes. ScriptTimeoutError Problem This error indicates that the job has reached the Docker container timeout threshold, and the script was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assigned the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. StaleElementReferenceError: element is not attached to the page document Problem The target page has loaded, but there was a change to an element between the execution of an element locator and an action being executed on the element. Solution Set your scripted browser to wait until the page is settled before performing a findElement() action. This can be accomplished by setting a custom wait time, using the $browser.wait(fn, timeout) function prior to the findElement call, to wait for a condition that indicates a settled page state. This will make it less likely for DOM manipulation to cause a reference to go stale. Alternatively, you can set a custom sleep delay using $browser.sleep(sleeptime_ms), stalling script execution for a specified amount of time. As this is a fixed amount of wait-time, which does not account for increased network latency or degraded site performance, we recommend using the .wait() function instead. Cause This error typically happens when the script attempts to .click() an element after using either the findElement() or waitForAndFindElement() function. If the DOM has changed between when the element locator was generated and the action was executed against the element, this error will occur because the actual element has changed. For example: the findElement() function is used to generate an element reference while the page’s script is actively manipulating the DOM. The DOM is then changed, causing the previously generated reference to become stale. The now out-of-date reference is used in an attempt to perform a .click() action, resulting in this monitor failure. Tip For more information, see the Selenium documentation on Stale Element Reference Exceptions. TaskTimedOut: task timed-out waiting for element to be located using: <LOCATOR> Problem The waitForAndFindElement(<locator>, <timeout>) function failed to locate an element within the provided timeout. Solution Confirm that the element locator being used for the target element is accurate. Avoid using By.XPath() where possible, as it is rigidly tied to the page’s DOM structure and can easily become out-of-date when there are updates on the page. Cause The target element did not exist on the page when the waitForAndFindElement(<locator>, <timeout>) function was called. This may be caused by the target page not being in the expected state. Common reasons for this error include: There is a legitimate issue with the target site. The element locator being used is incorrect. The target site has changed, requiring the revision of the Synthetics script. The previous action in the script did not successfully complete, causing the page to be in an unexpected state when the subsequent waitForAndFindElement() call was initiated. TimeoutError: Page load timed-out (unable to finish all network requests on time) Problem The target page loaded successfully, but returned the error: TimeoutError: Page load timed-out (unable to finish all network requests on time) Solution If the failures began suddenly, investigate any requests that could be blocking or delaying the page load event. If you are unsure which request is causing the error, use the timeline view to identify any long running HTTP requests. If the page is frequently unable to fully load within the current timeout, set a custom page load timeout using the $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) function. Cause The target page loaded successfully, but the page load event was not fired within the page load timeout set in the .pageLoadTimeout() function. There are a number of reasons you could see this error message, including: A blocked resource request on the page held up the page load. A resource request processed slower than normal due to an underlying network issue. A dependent resource on the page blocked the iframe load event. TypeError: $browser.isElementPresent is not a function Problem The function isElementPresent(), used by Synthetics monitors with a runtime >= 0.5.0, has been deprecated in Selenium 3. Solution To continue to use this function after depreciation you will need to create a custom version of this function, such as: return $browser.findElements(ele).then(function(found) { return found.length > 0; }); } Copy Example usage, which would return true: $browser .get(\"https://www.newrelic.com\") .then(function() { return isElementPresent($driver.By.id(\"nav_signup\")); }) .then(function(found) { return console.log(found); }); Copy Cause This can occur when attempting to use a scripted browser monitor script from an older monitor ( < = 0.4.1 runtime) with a newer monitor ( >= 0.5.0) runtime. Scripted API monitor errors JobTimeoutError: Job timed-out after 180s Problem The scripted monitor run reached the 180 second non-configurable timeout threshold, and the run was terminated.

SyntaxError: Unexpected token < Problem JSON.parse() was passed a string that begins with the < character and is likely HTML, instead of JSON. Solution Ensure the target endpoint is returning the expected response body. You can do this by logging the response body in the callback, before attempting to parse. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } console.log(body); // Log HTML response body, don't parse as JSON }); Copy Depending on the target API endpoint, you may need to include specific request headers to ensure that JSON is returned. Cause The script is attempting to use JSON.parse() on a response body after a request is made and is expecting the endpoint to return JSON, but HTML was returned instead. SyntaxError: Unexpected token u in JSON at position 0 Problem JSON.parse() was passed an undefined parameter, but expected a JSON string. Solution Troubleshoot the cause of the request error. Details on what is causing request errors can be found in the error object passed to the request callback function. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } var bodyJson = JSON.parse(body); console.log(bodyJson); // Log response body }); Copy Cause This can occur in Scripted API monitors when a performing an API request, then attempting to parse the request response within the callback function. The response body is passed to JSON.parse() without checking if the response body is undefined first. An undefined response body is often caused by a request error. If there is no error handling to prevent code that parses the response body, this monitor failure will occur. TypeError: Cannot read property 'statusCode' of undefined Problem The response object (and thus response.statusCode) in an API request callback is undefined. Solution Troubleshoot the cause of the request error. Details on what is causing request errors can be found in the error object passed to the request callback function. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } console.log(response.statusCode); }); Copy Cause This error occurs when there was an error completing the API request (for example, unable to reach server, unable to resolve DNS). In these instances, the request was not completed so the response object in the callback function arguments is undefined. If there is no error handling to prevent code that checks response status code, this monitor failure will occur.",

For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings.

      "body": "Read on to learn about synthetic monitoring's proxy settings and properties. Proxy settings API for scripted monitors Important You can set proxy server configuration for synthetic scripted monitors for monitor versions 0.4.0 or higher. The global object $network allows you to control the network configuration used by your synthetic scripted monitors. The following are applicable for both scripted browsers and API tests, unless otherwise stated. $network.setProxy(string or object PROXY URL) Sets a proxy server to be used for all per-URL requests (HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP). Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxy('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxy('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttp(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTP traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTP requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the port would be 80. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttp('http://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTP protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttp('http://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyForHttps(string or object PROXY URL) Tip This call is exactly the same as the per-URL setProxy call, except that it applies to HTTPS traffic. Sets a proxy server to be used for all HTTPS requests. Additional notes: The port is optional. If not provided, it will be derived from the scheme. For example, for HTTP the default port would be 443. The username and password are assumed to be the result of a call to encodeURIComponent(). Special characters like @ and : in the username and/or the password must be escaped. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description proxyURL | proxyUrlParsed String or Object The URL to connect to the proxy server. A string containing a proxyURL (for example, http://proxy_host:8888) or a plain object in the same format as defined by Node's url.parse(urlString) method. Examples An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol on port 1234 with no authentication: $network.setProxyForHttps('https://host.com:1234') Copy An example of setting a proxy server with HTTPS protocol with authentication credentials. $network.setProxyForHttps('https://proxyUsername:proxyPassword@proxyHost:1234') Copy $network.setProxyPAC(string PAC SCRIPT URL, object AUTH OBJECT) Sets a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script and returns a promise. This function is only available for scripted browser monitors. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description scriptURL String The URL of the PAC script. authCredentialsMap Object Map of authentication credentials to be provided to the proxy server(s), keyed by the hostnames of the proxy server. Values of this map must be defined in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'} Examples An example of setting a proxy server via a proxy auto-config (PAC) script: var authCredentialsMap = { 'example.com': {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}, } Copy $network.setProxyAdvanced(object PROXY RULES OBJECT) Tip This method is Chrome-specific: it only applies to scripted browser monitor types. It can be used to allow for a more flexible and complex proxy configuration. In most cases, this method will not be needed. Sets the proxy configuration using the format supported by Chrome Extension API for Proxying. The input is a ProxyRules object, as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. You can add authCredentials for proxies that need it. See Parameters for more details. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

      "body": "Problem Your synthetic ping or simple monitor reported one of these errors. For scripted monitor errors, see non-ping errors. Solutions These are some of the most common non-scripted monitor error messages. ERROR: Job timed out after 65 seconds Problem Your ping timed out after 65 seconds, the non-configurable check duration time limit. Solution The 65 second time limit is non-configurable. Pings exceeding 65 seconds may be a result of latency from the target server. Investigate potential issues along the network path between our servers and yours, as this may indicate an issue experienced by real users of your application. Cause Ping monitors will first perform a HEAD request. If this request fails for any reason, or reaches the 30 second HTTP connect timeout for ping monitors, then a subsequent GET request is performed. This error happens when both the HEAD and GET request exceed 30 seconds, usually due to server latency. NetworkError: Connect to (HOST) [HOST./IP ADDRESS] failed: connect timed out Problem HTTP requests during the check exceeded the non-configurable 30 second TCP connection timeout limit. Solution The 30 second time limit is non-configurable. Investigate potential issues along the network path between our servers and yours, as this may indicate an issue experienced by real users of your application. Cause This failure indicates an issue reaching your site from the location where the synthetic's check was performed. NetworkError: Connect to (HOST) [HOST./IP ADDRESS] failed: Connection refused Problem The target server refused connection from the synthetic ping monitor HTTP client. Solution Add our synthetic monitoring IP addresses to your allow list, to ensure traffic from our synthetic monitors can reach the target server. Cause The target server is likely blocking or rate-limiting synthetic's traffic. HTTPError: Server replied with HTTP XXX response code Problem The synthetic monitor encountered an unsuccessful status code, usually a response code that is not in the 2XX/3XX range. Solution Check your server-side logging to determine why the response code was sent. To assist with identifying synthetic's traffic on your server, all synthetic monitoring traffic includes an X-Abuse-Info HTTP request header and we provide a list of origin IP addresses for all synthetic monitoring traffic. Cause The cause depends on the response code sent. SSLVerificationError: (ERROR) Problem Your monitor returns an SSLVerificationError. Solution Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > Settings > General > Advanced options, then disable the Verify SSL check. Cause SSLVerificationError failures are a result of the optional Verify SSL check failing against the target host. SSL verification failed during execution for domain <TARGET_URL> failures indicate that the URL provided is not HTTPS or does not redirect to an HTTPS endpoint. SSLVerificationError: (<ERROR CODE>) <ERROR> errors are retrieved directly from the openssl command and often indicate a legitimate SSL configuration issue on the target site. ResponseValidationError: Response did not contain the expected string Problem The string value included in the synthetic monitor’s optional Response Validation field was not found in the target server’s response. Solution To troubleshoot: Check the failed results timeline to ensure the endpoint where the response validation text is expected, is the last endpoint being requested. Attempt a curl request against the target endpoint to see if the expected response body is returned. Ensure your endpoint doesn't have policies that will return different content depending on header content or request activity. If so, use a scripted browser to spoof a specific header string. If you’re using a simple browser to monitor a page whose content is loaded via JavaScript after the page’s load event is fired, consider using a scripted browser monitor instead. You can program scripted browsers to wait for specific elements to appear on a page before interacting with them. Cause The cause depends on the monitor type: Ping monitors: The string value must be present in the first 1MB (10^6 bytes) of the response body. Simple browsers: The string must be visible on the page when the page’s load event is fired. NetworkError: Read timed out Problem The monitor client was able to establish an HTTP connection to the target site, but then exceeded the 30 second read timeout while waiting for a response. Solution To troubleshoot: Investigate the target server's performance during the time period the issue was observed. Investigate potential issues along the network path between our servers and yours, as this may indicate an issue experienced by real users of your application. Cause This indicates an issue with the target server responding to the synthetic monitor HTTP client, or network latency between your server and ours. NetworkError: Socket is closed Problem The synthetic monitor's HTTP client was able to establish a connection to the target server. The target server then closed the connection without a response. Solution Add our synthetic monitoring IP addresses to your allow list, to ensure traffic from our synthetic monitors can reach the target server. Cause Edge infrastructure sometimes implements measures such as this for an application endpoint to handle traffic that violates behavior policies like rate limiting. NetworkError: No route to host (Host unreachable) Problem The synthetic monitoring client was able to resolve the target host’s IP address, but it was unable to find a route to the target host to establish a connection. Solution If the failure is occurring on a public synthetic monitoring's location, ensure that the DNS records for this host are resolving to a reachable IP address. If the failure is occurring on a synthetic monitoring's private location, ensure the private minion’s network configuration is properly configured and that the target hostname is resolvable and reachable via the private minion virtual command line interface. Cause This occurs when the target hostname resolves to a non-routable IP address per RFC 1918. HTTPError: Server sent us too many redirects (20) Problem The synthetic monitor client was redirected (observing 301 or 302 response codes) 20 times when performing a request to the target endpoint. Solution Ensure that the target endpoint redirects client requests less than 20 times. If this is only occurring within New Relic, recreate the issue outside New Relic to troubleshoot the root cause. Use a similar client to perform requests against the target endpoint: Ping monitors: HTTP client similar to curl. Simple browser and scripted browser monitors: Chrome 60 instance in an Ubuntu 14.04.5 VM. Scripted API monitors: Use the request HTTP client for Node.js. Cause This occurs when the monitored endpoint effectively serves a redirect loop to the synthetic monitor: The initial response redirects to another URL which redirects to another URL, etc. NetworkError: DNS resolution failed for host: (HOST) Problem The target hostname was not able to be resolved by the synthetic monitor’s HTTP client. Solution Private synthetic monitoring's locations: Confirm that the network configuration for the minion is correct. If the target hostname is an internal one, ensure that the minion is using your network’s internal DNS service that is able to resolve the host. The containerized private minion and the runner containers it spawns on host (to run non-ping checks) should inherit DNS configuration from the host /etc/resolv.conf. Docker: Network arguments like –dns or -network used in the Docker run command on the containerized private minion will only be used by the minion container but not the runner containers. If the DNS points to the loopback interface such as 127.0.0.1, define a DNS config at the Docker daemon level, or use a tool like dnsmasq to make sure the runner will forward DNS requests on the Docker bridge interface. Public synthetic monitoring locations: Ensure that the target site’s DNS record can be looked up by public DNS services such as Google public DNS and Amazon-provided DNS. Cause Our public synthetic monitoring locations use Google public DNS and Amazon-provided DNS. If DNS resolution of the target host is failing on our public synthetic monitoring locations, this is likely an issue other users are facing. If you are seeing DNS resolution related monitor failures on a synthetic monitoring private location, this is often caused by the private minion for that location having an invalid network configuration. BlockedRequestError: (URL) Problem The target domain is blocked by synthetic monitoring. Solution To unblock domains, you must use a scripted browser monitor and manually make calls in your script. Cause Synthetic monitoring specifically exclude scripts for popular analytics services such as Google Analytics. This ensures your analytics tools continue to receive accurate data, even with thousands of monitors checking your website each month.",

Parameters Parameter Data Type Description ProxyRules Object Object The proxyRulesObject is a plain object that follows the format ProxyRules as defined by the Chrome Extension API to configures proxies. This object is \"flavoured\" to fit our runtime: users can define an additional property, authCredentials, for the Proxy server objects to provide authentication credentials for a specific proxy server. authCredentials is an object in the format {username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword'}. Examples Here's an example of creating a proxyRules with authCredentials: var proxyRules = { singleProxy: { host:\"example.com\", authCredentials: { username: 'authUsername', password: 'authPassword' } } }; Copy Here's an example of setting up a proxied network with mixed network zone assets: var proxyRules = {singleProxy: {host:\"http://entproxy.mycompany.com\"}, bypassList:['s3.amazonaws.com','*.localcdn.com'] } $network.setProxyAdvanced(proxyRules) Copy $network.clearProxy() Clears/removes the current proxy configuration. Returns This method returns a Promise that will resolve once the configuration has been applied. $network.getProxy() This method returns the current proxy configuration. It must be synchronized in a promise callback. Examples An example of synchronizing getProxy with $network.setProxy(); and $network.clearProxy();: var assert = require('assert'); $network.setProxy(\"http://user:password@myproxyurl.com\") .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration applied'); //Note: $network.getProxy() is not synchronized with the webdriver Control Flow. //To make sure we get the proxy configuration after the call to setProxy() above // succeeds we need to use a promise callback var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); console.log(proxyData); }) .then(function () { // Again: getProxy() is not synchronized with the Webdriver Control Flow: we //need this promise callback otherwise clearProxy() might be called before the call // to getProxy() above returns return $network.clearProxy(); }) .then(function () { console.log('Proxy configuration cleared'); // We need this promise callback for reasons explained above var proxyData = $network.getProxy(); assert.equal(proxyData.rules, null); }); Copy Proxy properties Important This proxy information applies only to these versions: API monitors: 0.4.0, 0.2.2, 0.2.1, 0.1.0 Scripted monitors: 0.1.0 In order to analyze and collect your HTTP traffic metrics, New Relic must ensure the traffic passes through a conceptual funnel. Our synthetic monitoring includes a software funnel component capable of analyzing the HTTP requests or responses and then recording the information. New Relic's scripted browser monitors (versions 0.4.x and lower) include a mechanism to do this analysis without needing an HTTP proxy, so you don't have to configure anything. New Relic's API test (versions 0.4.x and lower) provides an $http object that is pre-configured to make the requests pass through the internal HTTP proxy. This allows you to write your test without including any proxy settings. If you want to use some other way to generate HTTP traffic while still collecting the HTTP traffic metrics, you can use $env.PROXY_HOST and $env.PROXY_PORT. To record traffic metrics, be sure to include these properties in your script.

      "body": "Problem Your New Relic's synthetic Simple, Scripted, or Scripted API (non-ping) monitor reported an error, but the application appears to have loaded correctly. For ping and simple monitor errors, see non-scripted monitor errors. Solutions Below are some of the most common non-ping monitor error messages. Simple or scripted browser errors Element A is not clickable at point (X, Y). Other element would receive the click: Element B Problem The synthetic script is attempting to .click() an element (Element A) at point (X,Y), but another element (Element B) is obscuring the target element. Solution Set a custom wait time, allowing time for a specific condition to be met. In this case, until the loading animation is no longer visible: .then(function() { return $browser.wait($driver.until.elementIsNotVisible($browser.findElement($driver.By.id('LOADING'))), 10000); }) Copy Alternatively, you can set a custom sleep delay using $browser.sleep(sleeptime_ms), stalling script execution for a specified amount of time. As this is a fixed amount of wait-time, which does not account for increased network latency or degraded site performance, we recommend using the .wait() function instead. Tip This will not correct .click() issues caused by sticky headers or footers. In these instances, you may need to scroll manually to bring the target into view. Cause This happens if the target element, at the time of the .click() function, is obscured by: A loading overlay, modal, or pop-up An animation that reveals the target element A sticky header or footer Error: element not visible Problem The targeted element is not visible to the Selenium WebDriver. Solution Verify that the targeted element does not have the CSS properties of display: none or visibility: hidden applied. Cause Any element that has a CSS property of display: none or visibility: hidden will not be found by the Selenium WebDriver, as the script will only look for elements that are actually visible to a user. Error: no such element: Unable to locate element: <LOCATOR> Problem The Selenium WebDriver was unable to find this element in the visible DOM. Solution To resolve this problem: Confirm that the element locator being used for the target element is accurate. Avoid using By.XPath where possible as it is rigidly tied to the page’s DOM structure, and can easily become out-of-date when there are updates on the page. If element is in an iframe, use $browser.switchTo().frame(<index or element reference>. Tip See the Selenium documentation for more information on switchTo() and TargetLocator() functions. Cause Common reasons for this error include: The targeted element is unable to be located by functions such as: $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) or $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [ , timeout: number This may be due to a timing issue. For example, the WebDriver is attempting to locate the element before the page has been loaded. Element is in an iframe, which is a separate document context. JobTimeoutError: Job timed-out after 180s Problem The scripted monitor run reached the 180 second non-configurable timeout threshold, and the run was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assign the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. NetworkError: Monitor produced no traffic Problem The API test or scripted browser monitor appears to be running but is returning this error. Solution Ensure that $http.get() or $browser.get() are being called appropriately and are generating traffic. For Scripted API monitors, if you are using a request option to spin up an un-instrumented HTTP agent under the hood, specify one of our instrumented HTTP agents using either of the agent request options below: $globalAgents.http $globalAgents.https Example: var options = { uri: 'https://www.newrelic.com', agent: $globalAgents.https, agentOptions: { 'rejectUnauthorized': false }, strictSSL: false }; function callback(err, res, body) { ... }; $http.get(options, callback); Copy Cause This occurs in scripted monitor runs when the HTTP client ($http in scripted api monitors) or Chrome browser ($browser in scripted browser monitors) is not used to generate HTTP traffic. In some cases, certain request options in API monitors may force a new HTTP agent, one that is not instrumented by synthetic monitoring, to be used to collect HTTP traffic. ReferenceError: $network is not defined Problem The $network object used for setting monitor proxies is not available for that monitor’s runtime. Solution If your monitor was created before the 0.4.0 runtime release, create a new monitor to take advantage of the latest runtime. Your monitor’s current runtime version is shown at the top of the monitor's settings. For more information, see Scripted monitor version runtime environments. Cause This error occurs when attempting to use $network on a monitor with a runtime at or below 0.2.2. Proxying monitor traffic was introduced in monitor runtime version 0.4.0, causing this method to be evaluated as undefined on earlier monitor runtimes. ScriptTimeoutError Problem This error indicates that the job has reached the Docker container timeout threshold, and the script was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assigned the task its own configurable timeout. If you have multiple steps where the $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator, timeout) function is called, ensure that the the sum of the provided timeouts to these steps does not exceed 180 seconds. If you’re finding it difficult to accomplish this, then that is a sign that the monitor should probably be broken up into separate monitor scripts. Cause All synthetic scripted monitors have a non-configurable maximum global 180s timeout for running a script. If a script has not completed after 180 seconds, the job is terminated. If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. StaleElementReferenceError: element is not attached to the page document Problem The target page has loaded, but there was a change to an element between the execution of an element locator and an action being executed on the element. Solution Set your scripted browser to wait until the page is settled before performing a findElement() action. This can be accomplished by setting a custom wait time, using the $browser.wait(fn, timeout) function prior to the findElement call, to wait for a condition that indicates a settled page state. This will make it less likely for DOM manipulation to cause a reference to go stale. Alternatively, you can set a custom sleep delay using $browser.sleep(sleeptime_ms), stalling script execution for a specified amount of time. As this is a fixed amount of wait-time, which does not account for increased network latency or degraded site performance, we recommend using the .wait() function instead. Cause This error typically happens when the script attempts to .click() an element after using either the findElement() or waitForAndFindElement() function. If the DOM has changed between when the element locator was generated and the action was executed against the element, this error will occur because the actual element has changed. For example: the findElement() function is used to generate an element reference while the page’s script is actively manipulating the DOM. The DOM is then changed, causing the previously generated reference to become stale. The now out-of-date reference is used in an attempt to perform a .click() action, resulting in this monitor failure. Tip For more information, see the Selenium documentation on Stale Element Reference Exceptions. TaskTimedOut: task timed-out waiting for element to be located using: <LOCATOR> Problem The waitForAndFindElement(<locator>, <timeout>) function failed to locate an element within the provided timeout. Solution Confirm that the element locator being used for the target element is accurate. Avoid using By.XPath() where possible, as it is rigidly tied to the page’s DOM structure and can easily become out-of-date when there are updates on the page. Cause The target element did not exist on the page when the waitForAndFindElement(<locator>, <timeout>) function was called. This may be caused by the target page not being in the expected state. Common reasons for this error include: There is a legitimate issue with the target site. The element locator being used is incorrect. The target site has changed, requiring the revision of the Synthetics script. The previous action in the script did not successfully complete, causing the page to be in an unexpected state when the subsequent waitForAndFindElement() call was initiated. TimeoutError: Page load timed-out (unable to finish all network requests on time) Problem The target page loaded successfully, but returned the error: TimeoutError: Page load timed-out (unable to finish all network requests on time) Solution If the failures began suddenly, investigate any requests that could be blocking or delaying the page load event. If you are unsure which request is causing the error, use the timeline view to identify any long running HTTP requests. If the page is frequently unable to fully load within the current timeout, set a custom page load timeout using the $browser.manage().timeouts().pageLoadTimeout(ms: number) function. Cause The target page loaded successfully, but the page load event was not fired within the page load timeout set in the .pageLoadTimeout() function. There are a number of reasons you could see this error message, including: A blocked resource request on the page held up the page load. A resource request processed slower than normal due to an underlying network issue. A dependent resource on the page blocked the iframe load event. TypeError: $browser.isElementPresent is not a function Problem The function isElementPresent(), used by Synthetics monitors with a runtime >= 0.5.0, has been deprecated in Selenium 3. Solution To continue to use this function after depreciation you will need to create a custom version of this function, such as: return $browser.findElements(ele).then(function(found) { return found.length > 0; }); } Copy Example usage, which would return true: $browser .get(\"https://www.newrelic.com\") .then(function() { return isElementPresent($driver.By.id(\"nav_signup\")); }) .then(function(found) { return console.log(found); }); Copy Cause This can occur when attempting to use a scripted browser monitor script from an older monitor ( < = 0.4.1 runtime) with a newer monitor ( >= 0.5.0) runtime. Scripted API monitor errors JobTimeoutError: Job timed-out after 180s Problem The scripted monitor run reached the 180 second non-configurable timeout threshold, and the run was terminated. Solution If this is a frequent error, consider breaking up the scripted tasks into a separate scripted monitors. If it appears that a specific task is causing the job to wait an unacceptable amount of time, consider changing the method by which you’re accomplishing that task. For example, changing $browser.findElement(locator: $driver.Locator) to $browser.waitForAndFindElement(locator: $driver.Locator [, timeout: number) would assign the task its own configurable timeout.

ReferenceError: $network is not defined Problem The $network object used for setting monitor proxies is not available for that monitor’s runtime. Solution If your monitor was created before the 0.4.0 runtime release, create a new monitor to take advantage of the latest runtime. Your monitor’s current runtime version is shown at the top of the Monitor Settings page. For more information, see Scripted monitor version runtime environments. Cause This error occurs when attempting to use $network on a monitor with a runtime at or below 0.2.2.

If this happens consistently it could be a sign of a script that is taking too long to complete, or that the job is waiting an extended period of time while attempting to perform a scripted task. SyntaxError: Unexpected token < Problem JSON.parse() was passed a string that begins with the < character and is likely HTML, instead of JSON. Solution Ensure the target endpoint is returning the expected response body. You can do this by logging the response body in the callback, before attempting to parse. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } console.log(body); // Log HTML response body, don't parse as JSON }); Copy Depending on the target API endpoint, you may need to include specific request headers to ensure that JSON is returned. Cause The script is attempting to use JSON.parse() on a response body after a request is made and is expecting the endpoint to return JSON, but HTML was returned instead. SyntaxError: Unexpected token u in JSON at position 0 Problem JSON.parse() was passed an undefined parameter, but expected a JSON string. Solution Troubleshoot the cause of the request error. Details on what is causing request errors can be found in the error object passed to the request callback function. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } var bodyJson = JSON.parse(body); console.log(bodyJson); // Log response body }); Copy Cause This can occur in Scripted API monitors when a performing an API request, then attempting to parse the request response within the callback function. The response body is passed to JSON.parse() without checking if the response body is undefined first. An undefined response body is often caused by a request error. If there is no error handling to prevent code that parses the response body, this monitor failure will occur. TypeError: Cannot read property 'statusCode' of undefined Problem The response object (and thus response.statusCode) in an API request callback is undefined. Solution Troubleshoot the cause of the request error. Details on what is causing request errors can be found in the error object passed to the request callback function. Example: $http.get('http://www.newrelic.com', function(error, response, body) { if (error) { throw new Error(error); } console.log(response.statusCode); }); Copy Cause This error occurs when there was an error completing the API request (for example, unable to reach server, unable to resolve DNS). In these instances, the request was not completed so the response object in the callback function arguments is undefined. If there is no error handling to prevent code that checks response status code, this monitor failure will occur.",

Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time.

      "body": "You can use secure credentials with synthetic monitoring to store critical information, such as passwords, API keys, usernames, etc. This prevents scripted monitor users from viewing, updating, or deleting these values unless they have explicit permissions in New Relic. The credentials are securely stored using AES-GCM 256-bit encryption at rest with keys managed by Amazon AWS Key Management Service (KMS). You can set secure credentials in New Relic One or with the API. Requirements and limits Before using secure credentials, review these requirements and guidelines: Secure credentials Comments Applicable monitors The secure credentials feature is available only for synthetic scripted browsers and API test monitors. Permissions Account administrators can control which users can create, view, or delete secure credentials by managing users' permissions. Limit You can have a maximum of 1,000 secure credentials. Add or update secure credentials You can add or update secure credentials using the UI or the Synthetics REST API. To add, view, edit, or delete a secure credential for a scripted browser or API test monitor from the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Secure credentials. Follow the UI instructions to add, edit, or delete a secure credential, then save any additions or changes you make. Tips for creating the Key: choose a username or other meaningful key name to identify the secure credential. Use alphanumeric or underscore _ characters. Key names must be UPPERCASE. Tips for creating the Value: Use any combination of alphanumeric or special characters. 10000 characters maximum. This field is not accessible via the API. Associate the secure credential with a scripted browser or API test by editing the script. After you add the secure credential to the script, the Secure credentials user interface shows how many scripted monitors use that credential. This number is approximate and only updates after a monitor with a secure credential has actually been run. Update the script When using the Synthetics UI editor to create scripted browsers or API test monitors, follow these guidelines: Script Guidelines Format Anywhere in the script where you reference the secure credential, it is accessed via the reserved New Relic $secure JavaScript object with dot notation. For example, $secure.MY_SECURE_CREDENTIAL. Properties on $secure are not accessible through bracket notation. Existing credentials To view or select from a list of available secure credentials: Type $secure. OR Select from the dropdown in the editor UI. Validation To validate the secure credential, follow standard procedures to test the script or write an API test. Any changes to the secure credential's value will automatically take effect across all monitors that use it. You do not need to also update the script. Exception: If you update the script and jobs are already processing, the secure credential change will not take effect until the next time the job begins. Security for secure credentials To ensure the security of your secure credentials, New Relic scrubs the secure value out of all data that goes to results in synthetic monitoring data and alerts. New Relic employees cannot access secure credential values and must be added to the account to be able to view secure credentials. Example A secure credential is named PASSWORD and the value is Pass123!. New Relic replaces Pass123! with _SECURECREDENTIAL_ For example, a script includes: $browser.get(\"https://example.com/\" + $secure.PASSWORD) Copy The script results will show that New Relic Synthetics went to https://example.com/_SECURECREDENTIAL_, even though it actually went to https://example.com/Pass123!. This ensures the value of the secure credential will not appear in the results. Redacted information We currently redact the following from the results of your monitor: The exact values of your secure credentials Any percent-encoded values of your secure credentials",

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also capture aggregate numbers, including an overview, or summary for ping monitors, detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Synthetic monitoring also collects custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. For a description of synthetic monitor types, see Types of monitor. Add a monitor There are several types of synthetic monitor to add. Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL. Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to add monitors. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor To edit an existing monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Important You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created. Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to delete a monitor. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page.

For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor.

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also capture aggregate numbers, including an overview, or summary for ping monitors, detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Synthetic monitoring also collects custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. For a description of synthetic monitor types, see Types of monitor. Add a monitor There are several types of synthetic monitor to add. Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL. Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to add monitors. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor To edit an existing monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Important You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created. Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to delete a monitor. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

They can also capture aggregate numbers, including an overview, or summary for ping monitors, detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Synthetic monitoring also collects custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. For a description of synthetic monitor types, see Types of monitor. Add a monitor There are several types of synthetic monitor to add. Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL.

Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to add monitors. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor To edit an existing monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Important You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created. Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to delete a monitor. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time.

Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page.

Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time.

      "body": "You can use secure credentials with synthetic monitoring to store critical information, such as passwords, API keys, usernames, etc. This prevents scripted monitor users from viewing, updating, or deleting these values unless they have explicit permissions in New Relic. The credentials are securely stored using AES-GCM 256-bit encryption at rest with keys managed by Amazon AWS Key Management Service (KMS). You can set secure credentials in New Relic One or with the API. Requirements and limits Before using secure credentials, review these requirements and guidelines: Secure credentials Comments Applicable monitors The secure credentials feature is available only for synthetic scripted browsers and API test monitors. Permissions Account administrators can control which users can create, view, or delete secure credentials by managing users' permissions. Limit You can have a maximum of 1,000 secure credentials. Add or update secure credentials You can add or update secure credentials using the UI or the Synthetics REST API. To add, view, edit, or delete a secure credential for a scripted browser or API test monitor from the UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Secure credentials. Follow the UI instructions to add, edit, or delete a secure credential, then save any additions or changes you make. Tips for creating the Key: choose a username or other meaningful key name to identify the secure credential. Use alphanumeric or underscore _ characters. Key names must be UPPERCASE. Tips for creating the Value: Use any combination of alphanumeric or special characters. 10000 characters maximum. This field is not accessible via the API. Associate the secure credential with a scripted browser or API test by editing the script. After you add the secure credential to the script, the Secure credentials user interface shows how many scripted monitors use that credential. This number is approximate and only updates after a monitor with a secure credential has actually been run. Update the script When using the Synthetics UI editor to create scripted browsers or API test monitors, follow these guidelines: Script Guidelines Format Anywhere in the script where you reference the secure credential, it is accessed via the reserved New Relic $secure JavaScript object with dot notation. For example, $secure.MY_SECURE_CREDENTIAL. Properties on $secure are not accessible through bracket notation. Existing credentials To view or select from a list of available secure credentials: Type $secure. OR Select from the dropdown in the editor UI. Validation To validate the secure credential, follow standard procedures to test the script or write an API test. Any changes to the secure credential's value will automatically take effect across all monitors that use it. You do not need to also update the script. Exception: If you update the script and jobs are already processing, the secure credential change will not take effect until the next time the job begins. Security for secure credentials To ensure the security of your secure credentials, New Relic scrubs the secure value out of all data that goes to results in synthetic monitoring data and alerts. New Relic employees cannot access secure credential values and must be added to the account to be able to view secure credentials. Example A secure credential is named PASSWORD and the value is Pass123!. New Relic replaces Pass123! with _SECURECREDENTIAL_ For example, a script includes: $browser.get(\"https://example.com/\" + $secure.PASSWORD) Copy The script results will show that New Relic Synthetics went to https://example.com/_SECURECREDENTIAL_, even though it actually went to https://example.com/Pass123!. This ensures the value of the secure credential will not appear in the results. Redacted information We currently redact the following from the results of your monitor: The exact values of your secure credentials Any percent-encoded values of your secure credentials",

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also capture aggregate numbers, including an overview, or summary for ping monitors, detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Synthetic monitoring also collects custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. For a description of synthetic monitor types, see Types of monitor. Add a monitor There are several types of synthetic monitor to add. Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL. Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to add monitors. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor To edit an existing monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Important You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created. Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to delete a monitor. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page.

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also capture aggregate numbers, including an overview, or summary for ping monitors, detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Synthetic monitoring also collects custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. For a description of synthetic monitor types, see Types of monitor. Add a monitor There are several types of synthetic monitor to add. Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL. Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to add monitors. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor To edit an existing monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Important You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created. Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to delete a monitor. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

      "body": "Synthetic monitors are API checks or virtual browser instances that monitor your website, recording each check in detail. They can also capture aggregate numbers, including an overview, or summary for ping monitors, detailed statistics for each page resource, and downtime incidents. Synthetic monitoring also collects custom response codes for more detail on your monitor runs. For a description of synthetic monitor types, see Types of monitor. Add a monitor There are several types of synthetic monitor to add. Ping monitors ensure your website is responding, while simple browser monitors send real browsers to check your website. For more complex monitoring, scripted browser monitors verify that specific resources are present, while API tests verify your API endpoint. Add a ping or simple browser monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type, name, and URL. Optional: Add a validation string or Advanced options: A validation string is available for ping and simple browser. This option enables substring monitoring for response validation. Verify SSL is available for ping and simple browser. This option verifies the validity of the SSL certificate chain. It can be duplicated by running the following syntax: openssl s_client -servername {YOUR_HOSTNAME} -connect {YOUR_HOSTNAME}:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/certs -verify_hostname {YOUR_HOSTNAME} > /dev/null Copy If a non-zero exit code is returned, the monitor will fail. The Bypass HEAD request option is available for ping. This option skips the default HEAD request and instead uses the GET verb with a ping check. Redirect is Failure is available for ping. If a redirect result occurs when Redirect is Failure is enabled, New Relic Synthetics will categorize the result as a failure, rather than following the redirect and checking the resulting URL. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a scripted browser or API test monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Specify a monitor type and name. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Optional: Set up alert notifications. Select Next: Write your script to create a script for your scripted browser or API test, then select Validate to verify your syntax. Tip For complex scripts, validation may take up to one minute. Select Create my monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a step monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select step monitor as the monitor type. Specify a name and choose a frequency to determine how often each location will run your monitor. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run. Build your monitor by selecting from the preconfigured steps at the bottom of the UI: Navigate to a URL Type text Click an element Assert text Assert an element Secure a credential Use the instructions on the right side of the UI to help locate elements by CSS class, HTML ID, link text, or XPath. Select Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a certificate check monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the certificate check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the domain you'd like to monitor. Enter the number of days it takes for your certificate to expire. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Add a broken links monitor Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > Create monitor. Select the broken links check monitor type. Specify a name and enter the URL you'd like to monitor. Select the period to determine your monitor's frequency. Optional: Add tags to help you find this monitor later. Select the locations from which you want your monitor to run, and then click Save monitor to confirm. Wait a few minutes, then check your monitor from the Monitors index. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to add monitors. For example, you can create a GET request to the monitor you want to use as the source for configuration, then use those key values to use in a POST to \"copy\" and create a new monitor. Edit a monitor To edit an existing monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. In the side menu, select a link to change the following settings: Select Settings > General to edit name, Apdex T, URL, locations, frequency, and advanced options. For Scripted browser and API test monitors, select Settings > Script to edit your monitor script. For synthetic monitoring alerts, click Manage alerts. Select Save changes to confirm. Important You cannot change a monitor's type after the monitor is created. Delete a monitor To delete a monitor: From the Monitors tab in one.newrelic.com > Synthetics, select the monitor you want to edit. From the selected monitor, select Settings > General. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the trash can icon. Tip You can also use the Synthetics REST API to delete a monitor. Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page. When using simple browser or ping monitor types, there is a 1MB (10^6 bytes) limit on the page load.

Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time.

Monitor settings When configuring monitors, the following settings are available: Type Select the type of monitor you want to create. A monitor's type can't be changed after the monitor is created. Ping: Specify a single URL to monitor for availability. New Relic will check this URL via HEAD or GET requests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Simple browser: Specify a single URL to monitor via real browser. Once each frequency interval, New Relic will check this URL via a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 60 seconds. Scripted browser: Create a script to drive a Selenium-powered Google Chrome browser. The browser follows each step in the script to verify that complex behavior is working as expected (for example, searching a website, then clicking one of the search results). The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. API test: Create an API script to ensure your API endpoint is working correctly. For more information, see Write API tests. The non-configurable timeout for this monitor is 180 seconds. Monitor name Defines a name for the monitor. Monitor names cannot contain unencoded angle brackets (< >). To include angle brackets in a monitor name, encode them as HTML bracket entities (&lt; &gt;) in the UI or API. Location Select the locations where you want your monitor to run. Select more locations to ensure that your application is available to users around the world. If you have any private locations, they will be listed here too. You can use the Synthetics API location endpoint to retrieve a list of valid locations for your account. Your monitor will run one check from each selected location during each frequency interval. For example, if you select three locations and define a frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Frequency Select how often the monitor runs, in increments of minutes, hours, or 1 day. This frequency applies to each location. For example, if you select three locations and a Frequency of 15 minutes, your monitor will run three checks, on average every 5 minutes, in each 15 minute period (or 8,640 checks per month). Alerts Specify an email address to receive alerts when a monitor fails. Or, attach a monitor to an existing alert policy for more notification options. For more information, see Alerting for synthetic monitoring. Apdex T Customize the Apdex T for this monitor. This setting is only available when editing the settings for an existing monitor, not when creating a new monitor. Change the Apdex T from the default 7 seconds for more accurate Apdex scores in your SLA reports. For example, if you have a very long scripted browser, you might adjust the Apdex T to 15 seconds to more closely reflect the usual completion time. Similarly, a good Apdex T for a simple browser check might be only 2 seconds. Response Validation (optional) Specify text to search for on the page.

Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time.

You can also view SLA reports for individual monitors: Go to one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > (select a monitor) > SLA. one.newrelic.com > Synthetics > SLA Report: Use SLA reports to understand your monitors' performance over time. Understand SLA report metrics Use SLA reports to view aggregated performance metrics for a single monitor, or for all your monitors from the account-wide SLA Reports page. SLA reports include the following metrics: Duration: The average duration across all monitor results. Uptime: The percentage of all monitor results that ended successfully. For example, Monitor A might check 50 times per day, and Monitor B might check 150 times per day. If Monitor A has 29 successes out of 50 and Monitor B has 148 successes out of 150, the Uptime would be 88.5: (29+148)/(50+150)=88.5 For individual SLA reports, the uptime score only includes the selected monitor. Apdex: The average Apdex across all monitors. Monitors have a default Apdex T of 7 seconds, but you can customize Apdex T for individual monitors by editing their settings. Apdex F, which defines a frustrating result, is always four times Apdex T. For more information about Apdex, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. For individual SLA reports, the Apdex score only includes the selected monitor. % Satisfied: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"satisfying\" time. A satisfying time is defined as a monitor result that completes in Apdex T or less. % Toleration: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"tolerable\" time. A tolerable time is greater than Apdex T, but less than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). % Frustrated: The percentage of monitor results which complete in a \"frustrating\" time. A frustrating time is greater than Apdex F (four times Apdex T). The account-wide SLA report includes all monitor types (ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test).

View the report in Excel or an external program Select Download this report as .csv to download a copy of your SLA data. Open the file in Excel, Google Drive, or another spreadsheet editor to analyze your data. Change your Apdex targets The default Apdex T for all monitors is 7 seconds. You can customize your Apdex T target for individual monitors by editing your monitor. Change the time frame Choose from daily, weekly, or monthly aggregation by selecting the appropriate tab. Make the report public Change the Public SLA setting to ON to allow non-authenticated users to view the report. Select Share Report to get the public URL to share. Generate SLA values The values in the SLA report are generated from Insights queries against the available synthetic monitoring data. You can easily recreate these values and modify the queries to meet your needs. This query returns the average duration, the apdex, and the uptime. Substitute your values for the variables highlighted and described below. SELECT average(duration), apdex(duration, t:), percentage(count(*), WHERE result='SUCCESS') FROM SyntheticCheck FACET timeperiod Copy Variable Value t: Supply the Apdex T that you would like to calculate your apdex against. The duration attribute in the SyntheticCheck event is stored in milliseconds, so an Apdex T value of 7 seconds should be included as 7000. timeperiod This is the period that you would like to calculate on. For a daily report, facet on dateOf(timestamp), for a weekly report facet on weekOf(timestamp) and for a monthly report facet on monthOf(timestamp). NRQL queries default to querying against the last hour of data. In order to widen the scope of your data you will need to include a SINCE clause at the end of your query.

      "body": "When you connect your data to New Relic, we process what we receive and apply data dropping and transformation rules. Then we count the bytes needed to represent your data in a standard format, like JSON. If you're on our New Relic One pricing plan, you're charged by the number of bytes written to our database, above and beyond the standard amount that’s free. Important This doc is for accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan. If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, see Original data retention. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. The Data ingestion page shows your ingest rates for a period you specify on the top-right of the Data management hub. Since 30 days ago is the default setting, but you can also set a custom date span. The page shows your daily average GBs, and the total for the range you set. You can toggle between an overall ingest view and an account view to identify which of your accounts are sending the most data. The page also provides the current month-to-date, and the projected end-of-month total ingest rates. With this information, you can proactively drop data or turn off agents in order to manage ingest and, therefore, costs. If you want to take a look at how we query the data, click the ellipsis icon (just above the chart) to slide out the chart query and open it in our query builder. And If you want to drill down further into your data usage, check out the sample queries in the usage docs. From the Login drop-down, select Manage your data, and then select Data ingestion. This is the Data ingestion page with data source and account views. Data ingestion sources The Data ingestion page describes which of your data sources provide the most data on average and during specific data ranges. The sources are described here. Billable data sources Description Timeslices (1-minute) and Metric:Raw Metrics are timeslices + MetricRaw Metric group: MetricsBytes Metric timeslice data averages to one-hour periods after eight days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in one-hour periods. We currently store the raw metric data for 30 days. You are only billed for the initial ingest volume. You are not billed for subsequent rollups. APM (transactions and errors) APM events Metric group: ApmEventsBytes InfraSamples:Raw Includes multiple Infrastructure events Infrastructure host data Metric group:InfraHostBytes Information related to your servers and virtual machines coming from infrastructure agents, including storage and network data Infrastructure process data stored in ProcessSample. Metric group: InfraProcessBytes Data are metrics related to each process running on the hosts running the Infrastructure agent. This feature is turned off by default. Infrastructure integrations Metric group: InfraIntegrationBytes Performance data related to applications and services, typically managed by the customer, including data related to Docker containers, Windows services, Nagios checks, and cloud integrations such as managed services in AWS, Azure, and GCP. Logging Includes logs and any Log_<value> custom data partition created Metric group: LoggingBytes Log records are stored into the Log event type by default. Additional custom data partitions will create new event types, which are always prefixed with Log_ and will be counted as part of the overall set of log data stored. With LogExtendedRecord, log messages longer than 4KB are split into multiple events that, when needed, are stitched together to display the original message; this reduces the size of message data. As of September 2021, log storage as blobs replaces LogExtendedRecord. With blob storage, NRDB can store up to 128,000 bytes for any attribute, not just messages. For more information, see our blobs documentation for logs. Default Custom events Metric group: CustomEventsBytes Mobile error Mobile general Breadcrumb crash event trails Mobile session Mobile exception Mobile crash Mobile events Metric group: MobileEventsBytes Tracing Metric group: TracingBytes TracingBytes includes Span and OpenTelemetry's SpanEvent. You are not charged for DistributedTraceSummary events. Browser:EventLog Browser Browser:JSErrors PcvPerf (PageView timing) Browser events Metric group: BrowserEventsBytes Lambda Serverless Metric group: ServerlessBytes Break down data to see what's contributing to your ingest You can inspect your data ingest to gain more information about your ingest health. This way, you'll know your baselines, and can more easily spot an anomaly like an ingest spike, as well as its source. To break down your ingested data, start from the chart on the Data ingestion page. Think of the data source bands as the Y axis, and the dates as the X axis. Click on the band you want to inspect at the spot in the X axis that corresponds with the date you want to investigate. This image shows the Metrics band for June 15 right before it's clicked. A modal opens with the account, data source, and facet selected. You can do a handful of things on this page: Change the account, data source, or facet you want to drill down into. Change the date and time to investigate. Review the results of the query in chart form. The chart displays the top 15 results for the facet query. Open the NRQL query in the Query builder where you'll find additional facets that you can use. Learn more about NRQL queries here. How we break your ingest data down Some of the content in the UI is variable, depending on your account. This information is intended to help you understand how we're working with your ingest data. The chart on the Data ingestion page shows data usage for a little longer time frame than that covered by your retention settings for each data ingest source. If you choose a date outside of your designated retention period for an ingest source, you'll get the message that there's no chart data available. Select a more recent date to fix this problem. If you inspect a data source for an account that has less than a terrabyte of data, we compute the ingest volume over a 24 hour period; otherwise, we compute it for a 1 hour period. The ingest value provided on the main Data ingestion chart will be slightly different from that reflected during inspection. This is because our facet computation is an estimate. Set alerts for data use Query and alert on usage data describes how to set alerts to get notified if you're nearing data ingest limits you don't want to cross. For example, you might set an alert on logs, which can stack up quickly in an active system. Adjust your data ingest Drop data for lower retention costs and data compliance On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. Learn how to set additional data dropping rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules. Turn off agents and integrations If you don’t need data from specific agents or integrations that you have installed, you can uninstall/delete those tools. For instructions, see the specific documentation for an agent or integration.",

Metric types Description Available query functions count Measures the number of occurrences of an event. The count should be reset to 0 every time the metric is reported. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval.

Metric aggregation Your NRQL query must use one of the following summary, uniqueCount, or distribution functions to aggregate metrics: Function Comments summary Creates a summary metric data point for each time window (currently 1 minute). Use this if your NRQL query uses aggregator functions supported by the summary metric type, such as average, sum, min, or max. Example rule-creation query: SELECT summary(duration) AS 'service.responseTime' FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'Data Points Staging' FACET name, appName, host Copy uniqueCount Creates a uniqueCount metric data point for each 1-minute time window.

Use this if your NRQL query uses aggregator functions such as percentile, histogram, min, max, average, sum, or count. Use only the attribute of interest as the argument, and discard the rest of the arguments from percentile or histogram. The generated metric supports any argument on percentile or histogram. Example of creating a distribution rule: SELECT distribution(duration) AS 'service.responseTime' FROM Transaction WHERE appName = 'Data Points Staging' FACET name, appName, host Copy Simple count: summary(1) and sum If you want a metric that's a simple count of the events, logs, or spans that match a particular WHERE clause, use the summary(1) metric. This metric type counts the number of specified events, logs, or spans per minute. When querying the created metric, use the sum method to see the result. Example: If you want to create a metric named foo.count that counts the transactions named foo, the NRQL would look like this: FROM Transaction SELECT summary(1) AS 'foo.count' WHERE name = 'foo' Copy Then, you would query it like this: FROM Metric SELECT sum(foo.count) SINCE 30 minutes ago Copy For more information about metrics, see our documentation about metric types. Rule-creation limits These limits affect metric rules creation: Limits Comments Account limits An account can have a maximum of 1,000 metric-creation rules. Metric rule limits A rule can: Create a maximum of 10 metrics. Use only one type of data (events, logs, or spans). Select a maximum of 20 attributes (facets) to include on a metric. Time window limits 50K limit on unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations for a single metric in a 24-hour time window. If this limit is exceeded, the rule is disabled and an NrIntegrationError event is created in that account that includes: The rule details A message about having too many facets A newRelicFeature attribute value of eventToMetric Limits on metric name and attribute value combinations The limit on total unique metric name/attribute value combinations in a 24-hour time window for an account is: Equal to three times the purchased monthly average data points per minute Up to a maximum of 10M Cardinality limits Rule-creation limits include limits on the number of unique combinations of metric name and attribute values. This limit exists because a large number of attributes and/or attribute values can lead to an exponential increase in the size of data reported. Example metric creation rule that attaches five attributes: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) WHERE entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName, entityName, processId Copy If each of the five attributes reported ten unique values within a one-minute time window, the number of unique metric-name/attribute combinations would theoretically have a maximum of 10x10x10x10x10, or 100,000. Multiple attributes with multiple unique values can lead to a large number of unique metric entries. In practice, this isn't usually the case, because attributes are often related. For example, if one attribute is hostname and another is awsRegion, when you see hostname A, it will always be in AWS region B; you'd never see hostname A and other AWS region values. This is why it's important, during the NRQL creation process, to use the uniqueCount function to verify how many unique metric-name/attribute-value combinations your NRQL query is generating. Multiple metrics from one rule A rule can create up to ten metrics. There are no functional differences between metrics created one at a time and those created with a single rule. Reasons for creating multiple metrics with a single rule: Less likely to reach rules-per-account limit. Easier to add the same attributes to multiple metrics. Example creating multiple metrics with a single rule: FROM Transaction SELECT uniqueCount(request.headers.userAgent) AS 'server.request.header.userAgent.uniqueCount', summary(duration) AS 'server.duration', summary(totalTime) AS 'server.totalTime' WHERE appName = 'Browser Monitoring Router' FACET httpResponseCode, name, appName, host Copy Metric naming A metric is given a name with the AS clause, as part of the NRQL rule-creation process. In the following NRQL example, the name of the metric is io.totalread.bytes: FROM ProcessSample SELECT summary(ioTotalReadBytes) AS 'io.totalread.bytes' WHERE entityType = 'ComputeSample' FACET awsRegion, awsAvailabilityZone, commandName Copy If there is no name assigned with the AS clause, the metric name is the name of the queried attribute. In this example, if no name was assigned, the metric name would be ioTotalReadBytes. Metric names Requirements and recommendations Requirements Requirements for naming a metric: Less than or equal to 255 (UTF-16) 16-bit code units. One way to ensure you are under the limit is to keep each string under 127 of whatever is easiest to count. No spaces. Start with a letter. Examples of strong metric names: rubyvm.memory.heap_used redis.container.cpu.percent memcached.process_virtual_memory.bytes Length and structure Decide on a name and structure that makes it easy for others to find, understand, and use this metric. We recommend keeping your metric name under 40 characters for ideal readability. Longer names can get cut off or overlap with other names. Your metric naming scheme will depend on your business logic. You may want to use namespaces to prefix your metric name, or your names may need to be more general. Components within the name If you want to create components within your metric name (like the source of metrics and the thing you’re measuring), we recommend going from broad to specific (left to right): Use a dot to separate those components in order to be consistent with our New Relic metric names. Then, use an underscore to separate words within the dots. Example: application.page_view.duration Copy Attributes Avoid putting attributes in your metric name. Attributes are qualities of your metric that you can use to filter or facet your data, like cluster or availability zone. Example: If you included availability zone in your metric name, it would mean, for that metric, you wouldn’t be able to see results across all availability zones. Changing metric names If you change a metric name, historical data will not be updated to that new name. To query or chart that historical data, you will need to specify the older metric name.",

      "body": "When you connect your data to New Relic, we process what we receive and apply data dropping and transformation rules. Then we count the bytes needed to represent your data in a standard format, like JSON. If you're on our New Relic One pricing plan, you're charged by the number of bytes written to our database, above and beyond the standard amount that’s free. Important This doc is for accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan. If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, see Original data retention. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. The Data ingestion page shows your ingest rates for a period you specify on the top-right of the Data management hub. Since 30 days ago is the default setting, but you can also set a custom date span. The page shows your daily average GBs, and the total for the range you set. You can toggle between an overall ingest view and an account view to identify which of your accounts are sending the most data. The page also provides the current month-to-date, and the projected end-of-month total ingest rates. With this information, you can proactively drop data or turn off agents in order to manage ingest and, therefore, costs. If you want to take a look at how we query the data, click the ellipsis icon (just above the chart) to slide out the chart query and open it in our query builder. And If you want to drill down further into your data usage, check out the sample queries in the usage docs. From the Login drop-down, select Manage your data, and then select Data ingestion. This is the Data ingestion page with data source and account views. Data ingestion sources The Data ingestion page describes which of your data sources provide the most data on average and during specific data ranges. The sources are described here. Billable data sources Description Timeslices (1-minute) and Metric:Raw Metrics are timeslices + MetricRaw Metric group: MetricsBytes Metric timeslice data averages to one-hour periods after eight days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in one-hour periods. We currently store the raw metric data for 30 days. You are only billed for the initial ingest volume. You are not billed for subsequent rollups. APM (transactions and errors) APM events Metric group: ApmEventsBytes InfraSamples:Raw Includes multiple Infrastructure events Infrastructure host data Metric group:InfraHostBytes Information related to your servers and virtual machines coming from infrastructure agents, including storage and network data Infrastructure process data stored in ProcessSample. Metric group: InfraProcessBytes Data are metrics related to each process running on the hosts running the Infrastructure agent. This feature is turned off by default. Infrastructure integrations Metric group: InfraIntegrationBytes Performance data related to applications and services, typically managed by the customer, including data related to Docker containers, Windows services, Nagios checks, and cloud integrations such as managed services in AWS, Azure, and GCP. Logging Includes logs and any Log_<value> custom data partition created Metric group: LoggingBytes Log records are stored into the Log event type by default. Additional custom data partitions will create new event types, which are always prefixed with Log_ and will be counted as part of the overall set of log data stored. With LogExtendedRecord, log messages longer than 4KB are split into multiple events that, when needed, are stitched together to display the original message; this reduces the size of message data. As of September 2021, log storage as blobs replaces LogExtendedRecord. With blob storage, NRDB can store up to 128,000 bytes for any attribute, not just messages. For more information, see our blobs documentation for logs. Default Custom events Metric group: CustomEventsBytes Mobile error Mobile general Breadcrumb crash event trails Mobile session Mobile exception Mobile crash Mobile events Metric group: MobileEventsBytes Tracing Metric group: TracingBytes TracingBytes includes Span and OpenTelemetry's SpanEvent. You are not charged for DistributedTraceSummary events. Browser:EventLog Browser Browser:JSErrors PcvPerf (PageView timing) Browser events Metric group: BrowserEventsBytes Lambda Serverless Metric group: ServerlessBytes Break down data to see what's contributing to your ingest You can inspect your data ingest to gain more information about your ingest health. This way, you'll know your baselines, and can more easily spot an anomaly like an ingest spike, as well as its source. To break down your ingested data, start from the chart on the Data ingestion page. Think of the data source bands as the Y axis, and the dates as the X axis. Click on the band you want to inspect at the spot in the X axis that corresponds with the date you want to investigate. This image shows the Metrics band for June 15 right before it's clicked. A modal opens with the account, data source, and facet selected. You can do a handful of things on this page: Change the account, data source, or facet you want to drill down into. Change the date and time to investigate. Review the results of the query in chart form. The chart displays the top 15 results for the facet query. Open the NRQL query in the Query builder where you'll find additional facets that you can use. Learn more about NRQL queries here. How we break your ingest data down Some of the content in the UI is variable, depending on your account. This information is intended to help you understand how we're working with your ingest data. The chart on the Data ingestion page shows data usage for a little longer time frame than that covered by your retention settings for each data ingest source. If you choose a date outside of your designated retention period for an ingest source, you'll get the message that there's no chart data available. Select a more recent date to fix this problem. If you inspect a data source for an account that has less than a terrabyte of data, we compute the ingest volume over a 24 hour period; otherwise, we compute it for a 1 hour period. The ingest value provided on the main Data ingestion chart will be slightly different from that reflected during inspection. This is because our facet computation is an estimate. Set alerts for data use Query and alert on usage data describes how to set alerts to get notified if you're nearing data ingest limits you don't want to cross. For example, you might set an alert on logs, which can stack up quickly in an active system. Adjust your data ingest Drop data for lower retention costs and data compliance On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. Learn how to set additional data dropping rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules. Turn off agents and integrations If you don’t need data from specific agents or integrations that you have installed, you can uninstall/delete those tools. For instructions, see the specific documentation for an agent or integration.",

This document describes the structure of our dimensional metric data, aka the Metric data type. To learn about how to query this type of data, see Query metrics. Metric types The metric type determines how the data is aggregated over longer time windows. It also determines which functions you can use to query the data. Metric types Description Available query functions count Measures the number of occurrences of an event. The count should be reset to 0 every time the metric is reported. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. You must specify a value for interval.ms when reporting the count metric type using the Metric API. The value must be a positive double. Generally, you want to take the rate of the sum: From Metric select rate(sum(myMetric), 1 minute) . . . sum distribution Tracks the statistical distribution on a numeric attribute. This metric is re-aggregatable. For example, 1-minute data points from 60 minutes can be aggregated into a 1-hour data point, without degradation on accuracy. This type: Supports statistical functions like percentile and histogram, and all functions supported by the summary type. Uses the same algorithm as the percentile function. percentile histogram min max sum count average gauge Represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include the temperature, CPU usage, and memory. For example, there is always a temperature, but you are periodically taking the temperature and reporting it. The value must fit into the range of a Java double. latest min max sum count average summary Used to report pre-aggregated data, or information on aggregated discrete events. A summary includes a count, sum value, min value, and max value. The count value must be positive. Examples include transaction count/durations and queue count/ durations. You must specify a value for interval.ms when reporting the summary metric type using the Metric API. min max sum count average uniqueCount Tracks the number of unique values on a string or numeric attribute.

      "body": "When you connect your data to New Relic, we process what we receive and apply data dropping and transformation rules. Then we count the bytes needed to represent your data in a standard format, like JSON. If you're on our New Relic One pricing plan, you're charged by the number of bytes written to our database, above and beyond the standard amount that’s free. Important This doc is for accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan. If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, see Original data retention. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. The Data ingestion page shows your ingest rates for a period you specify on the top-right of the Data management hub. Since 30 days ago is the default setting, but you can also set a custom date span. The page shows your daily average GBs, and the total for the range you set. You can toggle between an overall ingest view and an account view to identify which of your accounts are sending the most data. The page also provides the current month-to-date, and the projected end-of-month total ingest rates. With this information, you can proactively drop data or turn off agents in order to manage ingest and, therefore, costs. If you want to take a look at how we query the data, click the ellipsis icon (just above the chart) to slide out the chart query and open it in our query builder. And If you want to drill down further into your data usage, check out the sample queries in the usage docs. From the Login drop-down, select Manage your data, and then select Data ingestion. This is the Data ingestion page with data source and account views. Data ingestion sources The Data ingestion page describes which of your data sources provide the most data on average and during specific data ranges. The sources are described here. Billable data sources Description Timeslices (1-minute) and Metric:Raw Metrics are timeslices + MetricRaw Metric group: MetricsBytes Metric timeslice data averages to one-hour periods after eight days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in one-hour periods. We currently store the raw metric data for 30 days. You are only billed for the initial ingest volume. You are not billed for subsequent rollups. APM (transactions and errors) APM events Metric group: ApmEventsBytes InfraSamples:Raw Includes multiple Infrastructure events Infrastructure host data Metric group:InfraHostBytes Information related to your servers and virtual machines coming from infrastructure agents, including storage and network data Infrastructure process data stored in ProcessSample. Metric group: InfraProcessBytes Data are metrics related to each process running on the hosts running the Infrastructure agent. This feature is turned off by default. Infrastructure integrations Metric group: InfraIntegrationBytes Performance data related to applications and services, typically managed by the customer, including data related to Docker containers, Windows services, Nagios checks, and cloud integrations such as managed services in AWS, Azure, and GCP. Logging Includes logs and any Log_<value> custom data partition created Metric group: LoggingBytes Log records are stored into the Log event type by default. Additional custom data partitions will create new event types, which are always prefixed with Log_ and will be counted as part of the overall set of log data stored. With LogExtendedRecord, log messages longer than 4KB are split into multiple events that, when needed, are stitched together to display the original message; this reduces the size of message data. As of September 2021, log storage as blobs replaces LogExtendedRecord. With blob storage, NRDB can store up to 128,000 bytes for any attribute, not just messages. For more information, see our blobs documentation for logs. Default Custom events Metric group: CustomEventsBytes Mobile error Mobile general Breadcrumb crash event trails Mobile session Mobile exception Mobile crash Mobile events Metric group: MobileEventsBytes Tracing Metric group: TracingBytes TracingBytes includes Span and OpenTelemetry's SpanEvent. You are not charged for DistributedTraceSummary events. Browser:EventLog Browser Browser:JSErrors PcvPerf (PageView timing) Browser events Metric group: BrowserEventsBytes Lambda Serverless Metric group: ServerlessBytes Break down data to see what's contributing to your ingest You can inspect your data ingest to gain more information about your ingest health. This way, you'll know your baselines, and can more easily spot an anomaly like an ingest spike, as well as its source. To break down your ingested data, start from the chart on the Data ingestion page. Think of the data source bands as the Y axis, and the dates as the X axis. Click on the band you want to inspect at the spot in the X axis that corresponds with the date you want to investigate. This image shows the Metrics band for June 15 right before it's clicked. A modal opens with the account, data source, and facet selected. You can do a handful of things on this page: Change the account, data source, or facet you want to drill down into. Change the date and time to investigate. Review the results of the query in chart form. The chart displays the top 15 results for the facet query. Open the NRQL query in the Query builder where you'll find additional facets that you can use. Learn more about NRQL queries here. How we break your ingest data down Some of the content in the UI is variable, depending on your account. This information is intended to help you understand how we're working with your ingest data. The chart on the Data ingestion page shows data usage for a little longer time frame than that covered by your retention settings for each data ingest source. If you choose a date outside of your designated retention period for an ingest source, you'll get the message that there's no chart data available. Select a more recent date to fix this problem. If you inspect a data source for an account that has less than a terrabyte of data, we compute the ingest volume over a 24 hour period; otherwise, we compute it for a 1 hour period. The ingest value provided on the main Data ingestion chart will be slightly different from that reflected during inspection. This is because our facet computation is an estimate. Set alerts for data use Query and alert on usage data describes how to set alerts to get notified if you're nearing data ingest limits you don't want to cross. For example, you might set an alert on logs, which can stack up quickly in an active system. Adjust your data ingest Drop data for lower retention costs and data compliance On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. Learn how to set additional data dropping rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules. Turn off agents and integrations If you don’t need data from specific agents or integrations that you have installed, you can uninstall/delete those tools. For instructions, see the specific documentation for an agent or integration.",

This document describes the structure of our dimensional metric data, aka the Metric data type. To learn about how to query this type of data, see Query metrics. Metric types The metric type determines how the data is aggregated over longer time windows. It also determines which functions you can use to query the data. Metric types Description Available query functions count Measures the number of occurrences of an event. The count should be reset to 0 every time the metric is reported. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. You must specify a value for interval.ms when reporting the count metric type using the Metric API. The value must be a positive double. Generally, you want to take the rate of the sum: From Metric select rate(sum(myMetric), 1 minute) . . . sum distribution Tracks the statistical distribution on a numeric attribute. This metric is re-aggregatable. For example, 1-minute data points from 60 minutes can be aggregated into a 1-hour data point, without degradation on accuracy. This type: Supports statistical functions like percentile and histogram, and all functions supported by the summary type. Uses the same algorithm as the percentile function. percentile histogram min max sum count average gauge Represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include the temperature, CPU usage, and memory. For example, there is always a temperature, but you are periodically taking the temperature and reporting it. The value must fit into the range of a Java double. latest min max sum count average summary Used to report pre-aggregated data, or information on aggregated discrete events. A summary includes a count, sum value, min value, and max value. The count value must be positive. Examples include transaction count/durations and queue count/ durations. You must specify a value for interval.ms when reporting the summary metric type using the Metric API. min max sum count average uniqueCount Tracks the number of unique values on a string or numeric attribute. This metric is re-aggregatable. For example, 1-minute data points from 60 minutes can be aggregated into a 1-hour data point, without degradation on accuracy.

Metrics are aggregates of your data and are optimal for analyzing and monitoring trends over long time periods. This document explains: Reasons to use this feature Available operations How to use our NerdGraph API tool to perform operations Why create metrics from other data types? Using metrics allows for more efficient data storage. This in turn allows you to query your data and build charts more easily. The difference between metrics and other types of data in New Relic is based on time. For more information, see Understand data types. Events, logs, spans: These types of data represent a single record at a specific moment in time. For example, you may have an event for every request to the system. This data is ideal for in-depth troubleshooting and analysis. Metrics: These provide an aggregated view of your events, logs, or spans. Metrics are better for showing trends over longer time ranges. For example, you can aggregate the total number of requests per service to one metric and then examine this information month over month. Why use metrics? Comments Flexibility Metrics are dimensional. You can choose what metadata (like host name or app name) is attached to them. Common metric measurements, like average, sum, minimum, and maximum, are already calculated. Data aggregation and retention The data has already been pre-aggregated into longer-period time buckets. Data retention is 13 months. Query capabilities You can query using the Metric data type. When you create metrics, this does not delete your events or other types of data. However, metrics are better for longer-range querying and charting. To get started converting your data to metrics, create a rule. Available operations To show, create, and delete rules for generating metrics from events, logs, or spans, use NerdGraph, our GraphQL-format API. Before performing any operation, we recommend reading Intro to NerdGraph and exploring your data with the GraphiQL API tool. These operations fall under two basic request types: Mutations, which are operations that make changes to existing rules or settings (for example, creating a new metrics rule). Queries, for fetching existing data (for example, fetching existing metrics rules). All operations are role-based in NerdGraph as the currently logged-in New Relic user. Mutations Mutation operations for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics include: Create a rule See Create metrics. Delete a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To delete a rule, you need the rule ID and the New Relic account ID. Example request: mutation { eventsToMetricsDeleteRule(deletes: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsDeleteRule The method being called to delete a rule. deletes This takes two parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Example response for the request: { \"data\": { \"eventsToMetricsDeleteRule\": { \"failures\": [], \"successes\": [ { \"id\": \"12\", \"name\": \"Test Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } Copy Enable or disable a rule Important This operation modifies production settings, so we recommend thoroughly reviewing your changes before you run the operation. To enable or disable an existing rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics, use the same eventsToMetricsUpdateRule operation. The only difference is whether enabled is set to true or false. Example request to enable an existing metrics rule: mutation { eventsToMetricsUpdateRule(updates: {ruleId: \"12\", accountId: 123456, enabled: true}) { successes { id name nrql } failures { errors { description reason } submitted { ruleId accountId } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description mutation One of the basic API operation types. eventsToMetricsUpdateRule The method being called to update an existing rule and either enable it or disable it. updates This takes three required parameters: ruleId: The ID of the rule for events to metrics, logs to metrics, or spans to metrics. accountId: The New Relic account ID. enabled: To enable a disabled rule, set this to true. To disable a rule, set this to false. successes and submitted blocks Here you define the data returned by a success or failure. Available parameters for these blocks: id (or ruleId for submitted) name description nrql enabled accountId Queries Query operations include: List all rules for a New Relic account You can list all rules in a New Relic account or return a specific rule. Example listing all rules for account 123456: query { actor { account(id:123456) { eventsToMetrics{ allRules{ rules{ id name enabled nrql description } } } } } } Copy In this request: Element Description query One of the basic API operation types. Used to query but not make changes. actor This specifies the current New Relic user. account(id: 123456) Specify the ID for the New Relic account where to retrieve data. eventsToMetrics Scope the data only for events-to-metrics, logs-to-metrics, or spans-to-metrics rules. allRules Returns all rules for that account. rules In the rules block, you can define what data you want returned. Available fields include: id name description nrql accountId enabled Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"allRules\": { \"rules\": [ { \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"1\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" }, { \"description\": \"Metric for duration\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"2\", \"name\": \"Duration Rule\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(duration) as 'server.responseTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy List rule by rule ID If you know the exact ID for a rule, then you can query for a specific rule. For example, you may have just created a rule and now you want to list its contents so you can review it. Example listing rule 36 for New Relic account 123456: query { actor { account(id: 123456) { eventsToMetrics { rulesById(ruleIds: \"36\") { rules { id name enabled nrql description accountId } } } } } } Copy For more details about the elements in this query, see List all rules. Example response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"eventsToMetrics\": { \"rulesById\": { \"rules\": [ { \"accountId\": 123456, \"description\": \"Metric for total time\", \"enabled\": true, \"id\": \"36\", \"name\": \"Total Time Tx\", \"nrql\": \"select summary(totalTime) as 'server.totalTime' from Transaction where appName = 'Data Points Staging' facet name, appName, host\" } ] } } } } } } Copy Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL API tool You can use our GraphiQL tool to explore the data structure. You can also use it to build and run the operations to convert events, logs, and spans to metrics. To use this tool: Create the metrics operation's request with the required parameters. Go to api.newrelic.com/graphiql, and paste your query into the box. To execute the operation, press Play. Or, to get the cURL format, select Copy as cURL.) Validate the response in the response box. Optional: To verify that your rule-creation operation was performed successfully, run a list query for that rule ID.",

Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per child account in a given 24-hour time period.

      "body": "You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Agent version Your browser monitoring agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

      "body": "Mobile monitoring in New Relic sends some default event data from your mobile app to New Relic, such as data about interactions, sessions, crashes, and request errors. You can also create your own custom attributes and events for more detailed querying and analysis. Create custom attributes and events You can create custom session-level attributes for default mobile monitoring events using the mobile agent SDKs. For example, to record a username attribute for some part of your iOS or Android app, you would use the setAttribute API (Android | iOS). These attributes are session-related information and are shared by multiple mobile event types. You can also create entirely new custom event types and assign them their own custom attributes, using the recordCustomEvent API (Android | iOS). To help with crash analysis, you can use the SDK to create MobileBreadcrumb and MobileHandledException events. These events are available for querying and also displayed in the crash event trail UI. For more on creating custom attributes and custom events, see: Android SDK API guide iOS SDK API guide NRQL query examples MobileRequestError examples MobileRequest examples Limits and restricted characters Mobile event and attribute query examples Here are some examples of using NRQL to query your mobile app events and attributes: Custom event example: Track purchases To track purchases in your app, use recordCustomEvent to create an event type (such as \"UserAction\") and associate attributes such as \"name\" (with value \"Purchase\"), price, quantity, and SKU. Tip For performance reasons, you should limit the total number of event types to maybe one or two. The recordCustomEvent parameter eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories. For example, you might create an event typeGestures, and then create many different custom event names under the Gesture event type. Create an event on iOS: BOOL purchaseRecorded = [NewRelic recordCustomEvent:@\"UserAction\" attributes:@{@\"name\": @\"Purchase\", @\"sku\": @\"12345LPD\", @\"quantity\": @1, @\"unitPrice\": @99.99, @\"total\": @99.99}]; Copy Create an event on Android: Map<String, Object> userActionAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); userActionAttributes.put(\"name\", \"Purchase\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"sku\", \"12345LPD\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"quantity\", 1); userActionAttributes.put(\"unitPrice\", 99.99); userActionAttributes.put(\"total\", 99.99); boolean userActionRecorded = NewRelic.recordCustomEvent(\"UserAction\", userActionAttributes); Copy New Relic reports a custom event of type UserAction and name Purchase, which allows you to query all purchases made in your app in the last day: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace deprecated recordEvent method: As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create these custom events. If you have replaced the deprecated recordEvent method for your custom events, be sure to also replace its corresponding NRQL query with the new format. Look for queries used with recordEvent method, such as this: SELECT * from Mobile where category = 'Custom' and name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace them with the query format used with recordCustomEvent: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific user You can create a custom attribute to track a custom user identifier across the session, and then query for all that user's interactions. To add an attribute for the userId, call the setUserId method: Set the userId on iOS: BOOL userIdWasSet = [NewRelic setUserId:@\"jsmith\"]; Copy Set the userId on Android: boolean userIdWasSet = NewRelic.setUserId(\"jsmith\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that username in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE userId = 'jsmith' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific store id You can create a custom attribute to track a store id across the session, and then query for all that store's interactions. To add an attribute for the storeId, call the setAttribute method: Set the storeId on iOS: BOOL attributeSet = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"storeId\" value:@\"NY0531\"]; Copy Set the storeId on Android: boolean attributeSet = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"storeId\", \"NY0531\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that storeId in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE storeId = 'NY0531' since 1 day ago Copy Custom attribute example: Track a specific action You can use custom attributes to track the number of times that a specific action occurs in your application. For example, you can track the number of times a button was clicked or the number of times a level was completed in a game. To track completing a game level, call incrementAttribute with no value specified. This creates an attribute with a default value of 1: Create a counter on iOS: BOOL levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Create a counter on Android: boolean levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Each subsequent call to incrementAttribute adds 1 to the attribute level: Increment a counter on iOS: levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Increment a counter on Android: levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Important Be sure to reset the value to 0 when starting over. To reset the level back to 1 or 0, call setAttribute: Reset a counter on iOS: levelReset = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"level\" value:@1]; Copy Reset a counter on Android: levelReset = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"level\", 1); Copy When querying, use this level attribute to filter your data. For example, if you have a username and level attribute, use the max() function to find the highest level the user had reached: SELECT max(level) from Mobile where username = 'jsmith' Copy Size limits and restricted characters Limits for custom attributes added to default mobile events: Attributes: 128 maximum String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Limits for custom events: Attributes: 254 maximum per event (number includes default session attributes) String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Naming syntax and rules: See Rules for custom data. Set the time to send data By default, New Relic transmits event data in any of these situations: A session has been ongoing for 600 seconds. The app session ends by backgrounding. The app crashes. If the app crashes, New Relic gathers the attributes and events for that session and sends them to Insights. (On iOS, this happens the next time the app is launched). You can then use Insights to query and analyze the event and attribute data. To set the maximum time (in seconds) that the agent will store events in memory, use the following SDK calls: iOS method: + (void) setMaxEventBufferTime:(unsigned int)seconds; Copy Android method: public static void setMaxEventBufferTime(int maxBufferTimeInSec); Copy Privacy considerations If you want to collect personal data via custom attributes, please consult with your privacy or legal teams.

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

Page actions and views Use the browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Agent version Your browser monitoring agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

      "body": "Mobile monitoring in New Relic sends some default event data from your mobile app to New Relic, such as data about interactions, sessions, crashes, and request errors. You can also create your own custom attributes and events for more detailed querying and analysis. Create custom attributes and events You can create custom session-level attributes for default mobile monitoring events using the mobile agent SDKs. For example, to record a username attribute for some part of your iOS or Android app, you would use the setAttribute API (Android | iOS). These attributes are session-related information and are shared by multiple mobile event types. You can also create entirely new custom event types and assign them their own custom attributes, using the recordCustomEvent API (Android | iOS). To help with crash analysis, you can use the SDK to create MobileBreadcrumb and MobileHandledException events. These events are available for querying and also displayed in the crash event trail UI. For more on creating custom attributes and custom events, see: Android SDK API guide iOS SDK API guide NRQL query examples MobileRequestError examples MobileRequest examples Limits and restricted characters Mobile event and attribute query examples Here are some examples of using NRQL to query your mobile app events and attributes: Custom event example: Track purchases To track purchases in your app, use recordCustomEvent to create an event type (such as \"UserAction\") and associate attributes such as \"name\" (with value \"Purchase\"), price, quantity, and SKU. Tip For performance reasons, you should limit the total number of event types to maybe one or two. The recordCustomEvent parameter eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories. For example, you might create an event typeGestures, and then create many different custom event names under the Gesture event type. Create an event on iOS: BOOL purchaseRecorded = [NewRelic recordCustomEvent:@\"UserAction\" attributes:@{@\"name\": @\"Purchase\", @\"sku\": @\"12345LPD\", @\"quantity\": @1, @\"unitPrice\": @99.99, @\"total\": @99.99}]; Copy Create an event on Android: Map<String, Object> userActionAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); userActionAttributes.put(\"name\", \"Purchase\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"sku\", \"12345LPD\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"quantity\", 1); userActionAttributes.put(\"unitPrice\", 99.99); userActionAttributes.put(\"total\", 99.99); boolean userActionRecorded = NewRelic.recordCustomEvent(\"UserAction\", userActionAttributes); Copy New Relic reports a custom event of type UserAction and name Purchase, which allows you to query all purchases made in your app in the last day: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace deprecated recordEvent method: As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create these custom events. If you have replaced the deprecated recordEvent method for your custom events, be sure to also replace its corresponding NRQL query with the new format. Look for queries used with recordEvent method, such as this: SELECT * from Mobile where category = 'Custom' and name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace them with the query format used with recordCustomEvent: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific user You can create a custom attribute to track a custom user identifier across the session, and then query for all that user's interactions. To add an attribute for the userId, call the setUserId method: Set the userId on iOS: BOOL userIdWasSet = [NewRelic setUserId:@\"jsmith\"]; Copy Set the userId on Android: boolean userIdWasSet = NewRelic.setUserId(\"jsmith\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that username in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE userId = 'jsmith' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific store id You can create a custom attribute to track a store id across the session, and then query for all that store's interactions. To add an attribute for the storeId, call the setAttribute method: Set the storeId on iOS: BOOL attributeSet = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"storeId\" value:@\"NY0531\"]; Copy Set the storeId on Android: boolean attributeSet = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"storeId\", \"NY0531\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that storeId in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE storeId = 'NY0531' since 1 day ago Copy Custom attribute example: Track a specific action You can use custom attributes to track the number of times that a specific action occurs in your application. For example, you can track the number of times a button was clicked or the number of times a level was completed in a game. To track completing a game level, call incrementAttribute with no value specified. This creates an attribute with a default value of 1: Create a counter on iOS: BOOL levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Create a counter on Android: boolean levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Each subsequent call to incrementAttribute adds 1 to the attribute level: Increment a counter on iOS: levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Increment a counter on Android: levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Important Be sure to reset the value to 0 when starting over. To reset the level back to 1 or 0, call setAttribute: Reset a counter on iOS: levelReset = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"level\" value:@1]; Copy Reset a counter on Android: levelReset = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"level\", 1); Copy When querying, use this level attribute to filter your data. For example, if you have a username and level attribute, use the max() function to find the highest level the user had reached: SELECT max(level) from Mobile where username = 'jsmith' Copy Size limits and restricted characters Limits for custom attributes added to default mobile events: Attributes: 128 maximum String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Limits for custom events: Attributes: 254 maximum per event (number includes default session attributes) String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Naming syntax and rules: See Rules for custom data. Set the time to send data By default, New Relic transmits event data in any of these situations: A session has been ongoing for 600 seconds. The app session ends by backgrounding. The app crashes. If the app crashes, New Relic gathers the attributes and events for that session and sends them to Insights. (On iOS, this happens the next time the app is launched). You can then use Insights to query and analyze the event and attribute data. To set the maximum time (in seconds) that the agent will store events in memory, use the following SDK calls: iOS method: + (void) setMaxEventBufferTime:(unsigned int)seconds; Copy Android method: public static void setMaxEventBufferTime(int maxBufferTimeInSec); Copy Privacy considerations If you want to collect personal data via custom attributes, please consult with your privacy or legal teams.

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per child account in a given 24-hour time period.

      "body": "Mobile monitoring in New Relic sends some default event data from your mobile app to New Relic, such as data about interactions, sessions, crashes, and request errors. You can also create your own custom attributes and events for more detailed querying and analysis. Create custom attributes and events You can create custom session-level attributes for default mobile monitoring events using the mobile agent SDKs. For example, to record a username attribute for some part of your iOS or Android app, you would use the setAttribute API (Android | iOS). These attributes are session-related information and are shared by multiple mobile event types. You can also create entirely new custom event types and assign them their own custom attributes, using the recordCustomEvent API (Android | iOS). To help with crash analysis, you can use the SDK to create MobileBreadcrumb and MobileHandledException events. These events are available for querying and also displayed in the crash event trail UI. For more on creating custom attributes and custom events, see: Android SDK API guide iOS SDK API guide NRQL query examples MobileRequestError examples MobileRequest examples Limits and restricted characters Mobile event and attribute query examples Here are some examples of using NRQL to query your mobile app events and attributes: Custom event example: Track purchases To track purchases in your app, use recordCustomEvent to create an event type (such as \"UserAction\") and associate attributes such as \"name\" (with value \"Purchase\"), price, quantity, and SKU. Tip For performance reasons, you should limit the total number of event types to maybe one or two. The recordCustomEvent parameter eventType is meant to be used for high-level categories. For example, you might create an event typeGestures, and then create many different custom event names under the Gesture event type. Create an event on iOS: BOOL purchaseRecorded = [NewRelic recordCustomEvent:@\"UserAction\" attributes:@{@\"name\": @\"Purchase\", @\"sku\": @\"12345LPD\", @\"quantity\": @1, @\"unitPrice\": @99.99, @\"total\": @99.99}]; Copy Create an event on Android: Map<String, Object> userActionAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); userActionAttributes.put(\"name\", \"Purchase\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"sku\", \"12345LPD\"); userActionAttributes.put(\"quantity\", 1); userActionAttributes.put(\"unitPrice\", 99.99); userActionAttributes.put(\"total\", 99.99); boolean userActionRecorded = NewRelic.recordCustomEvent(\"UserAction\", userActionAttributes); Copy New Relic reports a custom event of type UserAction and name Purchase, which allows you to query all purchases made in your app in the last day: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace deprecated recordEvent method: As of Android agent version 5.12.0 and iOS agent version 5.12.0, use the recordCustomEvent method to create these custom events. If you have replaced the deprecated recordEvent method for your custom events, be sure to also replace its corresponding NRQL query with the new format. Look for queries used with recordEvent method, such as this: SELECT * from Mobile where category = 'Custom' and name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Replace them with the query format used with recordCustomEvent: SELECT * from UserAction where name = 'Purchase' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific user You can create a custom attribute to track a custom user identifier across the session, and then query for all that user's interactions. To add an attribute for the userId, call the setUserId method: Set the userId on iOS: BOOL userIdWasSet = [NewRelic setUserId:@\"jsmith\"]; Copy Set the userId on Android: boolean userIdWasSet = NewRelic.setUserId(\"jsmith\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that username in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE userId = 'jsmith' since 1 day ago Copy Attribute example: Track a specific store id You can create a custom attribute to track a store id across the session, and then query for all that store's interactions. To add an attribute for the storeId, call the setAttribute method: Set the storeId on iOS: BOOL attributeSet = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"storeId\" value:@\"NY0531\"]; Copy Set the storeId on Android: boolean attributeSet = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"storeId\", \"NY0531\"); Copy With this attribute, you can use a WHERE clause to see all actions performed by that storeId in the last day: SELECT * from Mobile WHERE storeId = 'NY0531' since 1 day ago Copy Custom attribute example: Track a specific action You can use custom attributes to track the number of times that a specific action occurs in your application. For example, you can track the number of times a button was clicked or the number of times a level was completed in a game. To track completing a game level, call incrementAttribute with no value specified. This creates an attribute with a default value of 1: Create a counter on iOS: BOOL levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Create a counter on Android: boolean levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Each subsequent call to incrementAttribute adds 1 to the attribute level: Increment a counter on iOS: levelIncremented = [NewRelic incrementAttribute@\"level\"]; Copy Increment a counter on Android: levelIncremented = NewRelic.incrementAttribute(\"level\"); Copy Important Be sure to reset the value to 0 when starting over. To reset the level back to 1 or 0, call setAttribute: Reset a counter on iOS: levelReset = [NewRelic setAttribute:@\"level\" value:@1]; Copy Reset a counter on Android: levelReset = NewRelic.setAttribute(\"level\", 1); Copy When querying, use this level attribute to filter your data. For example, if you have a username and level attribute, use the max() function to find the highest level the user had reached: SELECT max(level) from Mobile where username = 'jsmith' Copy Size limits and restricted characters Limits for custom attributes added to default mobile events: Attributes: 128 maximum String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Limits for custom events: Attributes: 254 maximum per event (number includes default session attributes) String attributes: 4 KB maximum length (empty string values are not accepted) Naming syntax and rules: See Rules for custom data. Set the time to send data By default, New Relic transmits event data in any of these situations: A session has been ongoing for 600 seconds. The app session ends by backgrounding. The app crashes. If the app crashes, New Relic gathers the attributes and events for that session and sends them to Insights. (On iOS, this happens the next time the app is launched). You can then use Insights to query and analyze the event and attribute data. To set the maximum time (in seconds) that the agent will store events in memory, use the following SDK calls: iOS method: + (void) setMaxEventBufferTime:(unsigned int)seconds; Copy Android method: public static void setMaxEventBufferTime(int maxBufferTimeInSec); Copy Privacy considerations If you want to collect personal data via custom attributes, please consult with your privacy or legal teams.

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

Set a custom identifier value with Objective-C or Swift to associate user sessions with analysis events and attributes (iOS SDK version 5.9.0 or higher). Caution Tracing is heavily optimized, but it does impose a performance overhead. Avoid instrumenting methods that are expected to be called hundreds of times. Install the SDK Ensure you have your app instrumented with the latest iOS SDK by going to one.newrelic.com > Add more data and following the instructions for iOS. This document contains the iOS SDK instrumentation requirements for: Objective C Swift For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events you can send to to New Relic Insights, see the iOS SDK API reference. You can also configure feature flags for: Objective-C Swift Automatically instrumented classes and methods The following methods (for the listed classes and their sub-classes) are already instrumented by New Relic. You do not need to add custom instrumentation to trace them. Classes Methods automatically instrumented by New Relic UIViewController viewDidLoad: viewWillAppear: viewDidAppear: viewWillDisappear: viewDidDisappear: viewWillLayoutSubviews: viewDidLayoutSubviews: UIImage imageNamed: imageWithContentsOfFile: imageWithData: imageWithData:scale: initWithContentsOfFile: initWithData: initWithData:scale: NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:options:error: JSONObjectWithStream:options:error: dataWithJSONObject:options:error: writeJSONObject:toStream:options:error: NSManagedObjectContext executeFetchRequest:error: processPendingChanges The agent aggregates performance for various methods into summary metrics that appear in the Interactions page. Summary categories include: View loading UI layout Database Images JSON Network Instrument your Objective-C code To have your own Objective-C code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines, add a _START call to the beginning of your method and a _STOP call to the end of it. Important Always include a _STOP for each _START, and only include one set of these commands in a given method. The trace system will automatically pick up the class and method name, and report performance metrics for your method to New Relic. - (void)myMethod { NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(0); // … existing code NR_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; } Copy If you are not using ARC, use this version of the _STOP macro to avoid memory leaks: NR_NONARC_TRACE_METHOD_STOP; Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the _START macro; for example: NR_TRACE_METHOD_START(NRTraceTypeDatabase); Copy Create and complete interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction with Objective-C, use these API calls: NSString* uniqueIdentifier = NR_START_NAMED_INTERACTION(@\"name\"); Copy This macro will automatically begin tracking the name interaction trace from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NR_INTERACTION_STOP(uniqueIdentifier); Copy This macro will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names with Objective-C, implement the - (NSString*) customNewRelicInteractionName instance method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string with Objective-C. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationVersion:] method and pass along the custom application version before calling +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:]; [NewRelic setApplicationVersion:(NSString*) appVersion]; Copy Set a custom build identifier As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode with Objective-C, call the +[NewRelic setApplicationBuild:] method, and pass along the custom build identifier. [NewRelic setApplicationBuild:(NSString*) buildNumber]; Copy Create custom metrics Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Objective-C: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Objective-C, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Objective-C: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkRequestForURL:(NSURL*)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer responseHeaders:(NSDictionary *)headers statusCode:(NSInteger)httpStatusCode bytesSent:(NSUInteger)bytesSent bytesReceived:(NSUInteger)bytesReceived responseData:(NSData *)responseData andParams:(NSDictionary *)params]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: [NewRelic noticeNetworkFailureForURL:(NSURL *)url httpMethod:(NSString*)httpMethod withTimer:(NRTimer *)timer andFailureCode:(NSInteger)iOSFailureCode]; Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code. To view a complete list of supported codes, see NRConstants.h. Instrument your Swift code To have your own Swift code appear in interaction code breakdowns and timelines: Add a startTracingMethod() call to the beginning of your method. Add a endTracingMethodWithTimer() call to the end of it. Always include an endTracingMethodWithTimer() call for each startTracingMethod() reference. Include only one set of these commands in a given method. func myMethod(){ let timer = NRTimer(); NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeNone) // … existing code NewRelic.endTracingMethodWithTimer(timer) } Copy If you want your method’s performance to be included in the summary data on the APM Overview page, pass one of the NRTraceType enum values into the startTracingMethod() macro; for example: NewRelic.startTracingMethod(#selector(MyClass.myMethod), object: self, timer: timer, category: NRTraceTypeDatabase) Copy Create and complete Swift interactions By default, an interaction starts when a view controller is pushed. To manually start an interaction, use these API calls: let uniqueIdentifier = NewRelic.startInteraction(withName: \"My Interaction\") Copy This call will automatically begin tracking an interaction trace named My Interaction from the current line. It will also complete any previously running interaction. It returns a unique identifier that can be used to complete that interaction by using this API call: NewRelic.stopCurrentInteraction(uniqueIdentifier) Copy This method will complete the interaction associated with the uniqueIdentifier if that interaction has not already completed automatically. You do not need to call this method. Rename a default Swift interaction By default, the iOS agent will start an interaction trace when a new view controller is displayed. The interactions are named using the format Display <ViewController>. To change these default names, implement the @objc func customNewRelicInteractionName() -> String method in your view controller, where the string returned becomes the interaction's name. Set a custom application version with Swift The New Relic iOS SDK allows you to set a custom application version string. Instead of using the string defined in CFBundleShortVersionString, call the NewRelic.setApplicationVersion() method, and pass along the custom application version before calling NewRelic.startWithApplicationToken();. NewRelic.setApplicationVersion(String appVersion) Copy Set a custom build identifier with Swift As of version 5.1.0 of the New Relic iOS SDK, an API method allows you to set a custom build identifier that is displayed next to the application version in the Crash details page. Instead of using the CFBundleVersion string defined in Xcode, call the NewRelic.setApplicationBuild() method, and pass along the custom build identifier. NewRelic.setApplicationBuild(buildNumber) Copy Create custom metrics with Swift Custom metrics can help track high level events specific to your application. With the recordMetric API, you can record arbitrary numerical data and named events with Objective-C and Swift. You can also use several API calls to record custom metrics that provide different levels of detail. Swift: Report custom attributes and events Use methods in the NewRelic object to report custom attributes and events. For details about the available methods for custom attributes and events with Swift, see the iOS SDK API reference. Methods that return BOOL results return YES if they succeed, or NO if the operation did not complete. These methods are available in versions 5.0.0 or higher of the New Relic iOS SDK. The SDK can store up to 128 user-defined custom attributes at a time. If you attempt to store more than 128 attributes, the SDK returns NO. Custom attributes names should use the simplest format needed, and New Relic recommends single word attributes, containing no spaces. Attribute phrases can be formatted in camel case, so My Custom Attribute is better specified as myCustomAttribute. As with custom metrics: Avoid using the characters / ] [ | * when naming things. Avoid multi-byte characters. Swift: Track custom network requests If you can express a transactional network request in terms similar to an HTTP request, you can track it. Use URLs that are well-formed and do not include highly variable paths or hostnames. For requests that complete, use this method: NewRelic.noticeNetworkRequestForURL(url: NSURL!, httpMethod: String!, withTimer: NRTimer!, responseHeaders:[NSObject : AnyObject]!, statusCode: Int, bytesSent: UInt, bytesReceived: UInt, responseData: NSData!, andParams: [NSObject : AnyObject]!) Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request headers A dictionary containing the HTTP response headers, if available httpStatusCode The response status code If the httpStatusCode is greater than or equal to 400, the agent will record a server error and may capture the responseData body if provided. bytesSent The size of the request body bytesReceived The size of the responseBody responseData The response body data, captured if the agent records Server error params params Additional parameters included in an HTTP error metric if the HTTP transaction is an error For requests that fail due to a socket or operating system error, use this method: NewRelic.noticeNetworkFailureForURL(url: NSURL!, httpMethod: NSString!, withTimer: NRTimer!, andFailureCode: Int) Copy Parameters include: Parameter Description url The URL of the request httpMethod The method type of the request; for example, POST, GET, etc. timer An NRTimer that timed the network request iOSFailureCode The failure code Failure codes are interpreted as NSURLError* code.

      "body": "You can use browser monitoring in New Relic to add custom events and attributes. Page actions and views Use the browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Agent version Your browser monitoring agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

Additional requirements may apply based on the method you use. You can report custom events to New Relic in several ways, including: APM agent APIs Event API (There are additional requirements when using the Event API.) Browser monitoring agent APIs (There are additional requirements with the custom PageAction event.) Mobile monitoring SDK General requirements When reporting custom events and attributes, follow these general requirements for supported data types, naming syntax, and size: Requirement Description Payload Total maximum size or length: 1MB (10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. The Event API has additional HTTP rate limits. Attribute data types Attribute values can be either a string or a numeric integer or float. If your attribute values contain date information, define it as an unformatted Unix timestamp (in seconds or milliseconds) by using the Insights data formatter. Attribute size Maximum name size: 255 bytes. Maximum attribute value size: Custom attributes sent by the agent: 255 bytes Attributes attached to custom events sent using the Event API: 4096 characters Maximum total attributes per event: 254. Exception: If you use an APM agent API, the max is 64. Maximum total attributes per event type: 48,000. Important Charts may only display the first 255 characters of attribute values. For complete attribute values, use the JSON chart type or Query API. Naming syntax Attribute names can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), periods (.), and underscores (_). Event types (using the eventType attribute) can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Do not use words reserved for use by NRQL. Null values The database does not store any data with a null value. Reserved words Avoid using the following reserved words as names for events and attributes. Otherwise, unexpected results may occur. Important This is not a complete list. In general, avoid using MySQL-reserved words to avoid collision with future New Relic functionality. Keyword Description accountId This is a reserved attribute name. If it's included, it will be dropped during ingest. appId Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType The event type as stored in New Relic. New Relic agents and scripts normally report this as eventType. Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, colons (:), and underscores (_). Be sure to review the prohibited eventType values and eventType limits. Prohibited eventType values For your eventType value, avoid using: Metric, MetricRaw, and strings prefixed with Metric[0-9] (such as Metric2 or Metric1Minute). Public_ and strings prefixed with Public_. These event types are reserved for use by New Relic. Events passed in with these eventType values will be dropped. timestamp Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. It must be +/-1 day (24 hours) of the current time on the server. Log forwarding terms The following keys are reserved by the Infrastructure agent's log forwarding feature: entity.guid, log, hostname, plugin.type, fb.input. If used, they are dropped during ingest and a warning is added to the logs. NRQL syntax terms If you need to use NRQL syntax terms as attribute names, including dotted attributes, they must be enclosed in backticks; for example, `LIMIT` or `consumer.offset`. Otherwise, avoid using these reserved words: ago, and, as, auto, begin, begintime, compare, day, days, end, endtime, explain, facet, from, hour, hours, in, is, like, limit, minute, minutes, month, months, not, null, offset, or, raw, second, seconds, select, since, timeseries, until, week, weeks, where, with Event type limits The current limit for total number of eventType values is 250 per child account in a given 24-hour time period.

Page actions and views Use the browser API's addPageAction call to capture events, actions, route changes, or any end-user interactions with your application. The addPageAction call adds an event named PageAction that contains the action name and any custom attribute names and values you capture along with it. The PageAction event also contains any custom attributes you added to the PageView event. Add custom attributes to the PageView event so you can query or filter your data to answer more questions about your application. Prerequisites In order to report PageAction events, verify these prerequisites: Requirement Comments Agent version Your browser monitoring agent version must be 593 or higher. Client browser version To record PageAction events, the browser must support cross-domain XHRs. Max events per cycle PageAction events are reported every 30 seconds, with a maximum of 120 events per 30-second harvest cycle, per browser. After the 120-event limit is reached, additional events are not captured for that cycle. Event/attribute naming, data type, size Ensure you follow general requirements around event/attribute naming syntax, data types, and size. Create PageAction events To create a PageAction event: Ensure the browser agent is installed for your app. Call the newrelic.addPageAction function in the relevant part of your application's JavaScript. Wait a couple minutes for the application to run and report relevant PageAction events. Run a NRQL query of the PageAction event that includes the actionName attribute you used to capture the event (and any associated attributes you sent along with the action). Add custom attributes to PageView event The PageView event is a default browser-reported event. You can add custom attributes to the PageView event. Any custom attributes you add to the PageView event are also automatically added to the PageAction event. There are two ways to add custom attributes to the PageView event: Use setCustomAttribute browser API call To add a custom attribute to the PageView event via the browser agent, use the setCustomAttribute browser API call. This allows you to capture an attribute to be annotated on any PageAction event. Forward custom attributes from APM data If you added custom attributes to the APM Transaction event via an APM agent, you can forward those custom attributes to the PageView event automatically: Insert custom attributes by following the agent-specific instructions. Enable attribute forwarding in your agent configuration file: Agent Enable attribute forwarding C SDK Not supported. Go To enable attributes, add this to your config (disabled by default): cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Enabled = true Copy Then add the attributes you want to include: cfg.BrowserMonitoring.Attributes.Include = []string{\"request.*\"} Copy Java Add the attributes.enabled option in the browser_monitoring stanza and set it to true. .NET Add the <attributes enabled=\"true\"> element as a child of the browserMonitoring element: <configuration xmlns=\"urn:newrelic-config\"> ... <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"true\"> ... <attributes enabled=\"true\"> ... </attributes> </browserMonitoring> ... </configuration> Copy If you are using manual browser instrumentation the attribute needs to be created before the GetBrowserTimingHeader() call. Node.js Add attributes: {enabled: true} to the browser_monitoring: { section of your app's newrelicjs configuration file. PHP Add the newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Python Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. Ruby Add the browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled option and set it to true. PageAction and PageView attributes To see the default attributes of PageAction and PageView, see Browser events. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips: Problem Comments Custom attributes missing If your custom attributes do not appear on PageView events, verify you are calling setCustomAttribute before the Load event on your page. If the custom attribute is called after the page load occurs, it will not be visible on PageView. PageAction events If your PageAction events do not appear when you query, check that your account is compatible. If your account is compatible, check that you are not using reserved attribute names or invalid values.",

Requirements For event and attribute formatting requirements and best practices, see Limits and requirements. Avoid rate limits Reporting a large number of custom events and/or attributes can cause degraded query performance. It may also result in approaching or passing data collection rate limits. For optimal performance, first think about what data you want to analyze, and then create only the events and/or attributes necessary to meet these specific goals. Be aware of the following data and subscription requirements for inserting and accessing custom data: Ensure you follow limits and requirements around event/attribute data types, naming syntax, and size. The amount of data you have access to over time depends on your data retention policy. Example use cases Two popular custom data solutions are custom events and custom attributes. There are several ways to accomplish this (more on that later in this doc), depending on your New Relic implementation and tools. Here are some common use cases for implementing custom events and attributes. Using custom attributes Custom attributes are often used to add important business and operational context to existing events. Business context might include: Customer token Customer market segment Customer value classification Workflow control values not obvious in the URIStem User/product/account privilege context Operational context might include: Which feature flags were used What datastore was accessed What cache was accessed What errors were detected and ignored (fault partitioning) Using custom events Event data is one of New Relic's four core data types. We recommend reading that definition to understand what we mean by \"event\" and why that data type is most used for reporting specific types of activity. The use cases for custom events varies widely: basically they are used for any type of activity that an organization deems important and that is not already being monitored. A couple examples: An event might represent an activity involving multiple actions, like a customer purchasing a certain combination of products. An event might record backup activity. For example, they might set up reporting of events that represent production backups of their SOLR instances into an event table, with a timestamp of when it occurred, which cluster, and the duration. Send custom events and attributes Methods for sending custom events and attributes include: Source How to send custom data APM agent Use APM agent APIs to report custom events and custom attributes. Browser monitoring agent Add custom attributes to the PageView event via the browser API call addCustomAttribute. Send PageAction event and attributes via browser API. Forward APM agent custom attributes to PageView event. Event API To report custom events not associated with other New Relic products, use the Event API. Infrastructure monitoring agent Add custom attributes to default Infrastructure events. Use the Flex integration tool to report your own custom event data. Mobile monitoring agent Use the mobile agent API to send custom events and attributes. Synthetic monitoring Add custom attributes to the SyntheticCheck event via the $util.insights tools. For ways to report other types of custom data, see: Metric API Logs Trace API Extend data retention To learn how to extend how long events are retained in your account, see our documentation about event data retention.",

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

Important This doc is for accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan. If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, see Original data retention. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. The Data ingestion page shows your ingest rates for a period you specify on the top-right of the Data management hub. Since 30 days ago is the default setting, but you can also set a custom date span. The page shows your daily average GBs, and the total for the range you set. You can toggle between an overall ingest view and an account view to identify which of your accounts are sending the most data. The page also provides the current month-to-date, and the projected end-of-month total ingest rates. With this information, you can proactively drop data or turn off agents in order to manage ingest and, therefore, costs. If you want to take a look at how we query the data, click the ellipsis icon (just above the chart) to slide out the chart query and open it in our query builder. And If you want to drill down further into your data usage, check out the sample queries in the usage docs. From the Login drop-down, select Manage your data, and then select Data ingestion. This is the Data ingestion page with data source and account views. Data ingestion sources The Data ingestion page describes which of your data sources provide the most data on average and during specific data ranges. The sources are described here. Billable data sources Description Timeslices (1-minute) and Metric:Raw Metrics are timeslices + MetricRaw Metric group: MetricsBytes Metric timeslice data averages to one-hour periods after eight days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in one-hour periods. We currently store the raw metric data for 30 days. You are only billed for the initial ingest volume. You are not billed for subsequent rollups. APM (transactions and errors) APM events Metric group: ApmEventsBytes InfraSamples:Raw Includes multiple Infrastructure events Infrastructure host data Metric group:InfraHostBytes Information related to your servers and virtual machines coming from infrastructure agents, including storage and network data Infrastructure process data stored in ProcessSample. Metric group: InfraProcessBytes Data are metrics related to each process running on the hosts running the Infrastructure agent. This feature is turned off by default. Infrastructure integrations Metric group: InfraIntegrationBytes Performance data related to applications and services, typically managed by the customer, including data related to Docker containers, Windows services, Nagios checks, and cloud integrations such as managed services in AWS, Azure, and GCP. Logging Includes logs and any Log_<value> custom data partition created Metric group: LoggingBytes Log records are stored into the Log event type by default. Additional custom data partitions will create new event types, which are always prefixed with Log_ and will be counted as part of the overall set of log data stored. With LogExtendedRecord, log messages longer than 4KB are split into multiple events that, when needed, are stitched together to display the original message; this reduces the size of message data. As of September 2021, log storage as blobs replaces LogExtendedRecord. With blob storage, NRDB can store up to 128,000 bytes for any attribute, not just messages. For more information, see our blobs documentation for logs. Default Custom events Metric group: CustomEventsBytes Mobile error Mobile general Breadcrumb crash event trails Mobile session Mobile exception Mobile crash Mobile events Metric group: MobileEventsBytes Tracing Metric group: TracingBytes TracingBytes includes Span and OpenTelemetry's SpanEvent.

This way, you'll know your baselines, and can more easily spot an anomaly like an ingest spike, as well as its source. To break down your ingested data, start from the chart on the Data ingestion page. Think of the data source bands as the Y axis, and the dates as the X axis. Click on the band you want to inspect at the spot in the X axis that corresponds with the date you want to investigate. This image shows the Metrics band for June 15 right before it's clicked. A modal opens with the account, data source, and facet selected. You can do a handful of things on this page: Change the account, data source, or facet you want to drill down into. Change the date and time to investigate. Review the results of the query in chart form. The chart displays the top 15 results for the facet query. Open the NRQL query in the Query builder where you'll find additional facets that you can use. Learn more about NRQL queries here. How we break your ingest data down Some of the content in the UI is variable, depending on your account. This information is intended to help you understand how we're working with your ingest data. The chart on the Data ingestion page shows data usage for a little longer time frame than that covered by your retention settings for each data ingest source. If you choose a date outside of your designated retention period for an ingest source, you'll get the message that there's no chart data available. Select a more recent date to fix this problem. If you inspect a data source for an account that has less than a terrabyte of data, we compute the ingest volume over a 24 hour period; otherwise, we compute it for a 1 hour period. The ingest value provided on the main Data ingestion chart will be slightly different from that reflected during inspection. This is because our facet computation is an estimate. Set alerts for data use Query and alert on usage data describes how to set alerts to get notified if you're nearing data ingest limits you don't want to cross. For example, you might set an alert on logs, which can stack up quickly in an active system. Adjust your data ingest Drop data for lower retention costs and data compliance On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. Learn how to set additional data dropping rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules. Turn off agents and integrations If you don’t need data from specific agents or integrations that you have installed, you can uninstall/delete those tools. For instructions, see the specific documentation for an agent or integration.",

Then we count the bytes needed to represent your data in a standard format, like JSON. If you're on our New Relic One pricing plan, you're charged by the number of bytes written to our database, above and beyond the standard amount that’s free. Important This doc is for accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan. If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, see Original data retention. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. The Data ingestion page shows your ingest rates for a period you specify on the top-right of the Data management hub. Since 30 days ago is the default setting, but you can also set a custom date span. The page shows your daily average GBs, and the total for the range you set. You can toggle between an overall ingest view and an account view to identify which of your accounts are sending the most data. The page also provides the current month-to-date, and the projected end-of-month total ingest rates. With this information, you can proactively drop data or turn off agents in order to manage ingest and, therefore, costs. If you want to take a look at how we query the data, click the ellipsis icon (just above the chart) to slide out the chart query and open it in our query builder. And If you want to drill down further into your data usage, check out the sample queries in the usage docs. From the Login drop-down, select Manage your data, and then select Data ingestion. This is the Data ingestion page with data source and account views. Data ingestion sources The Data ingestion page describes which of your data sources provide the most data on average and during specific data ranges. The sources are described here. Billable data sources Description Timeslices (1-minute) and Metric:Raw Metrics are timeslices + MetricRaw Metric group: MetricsBytes Metric timeslice data averages to one-hour periods after eight days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in one-hour periods. We currently store the raw metric data for 30 days. You are only billed for the initial ingest volume. You are not billed for subsequent rollups. APM (transactions and errors) APM events Metric group: ApmEventsBytes InfraSamples:Raw Includes multiple Infrastructure events Infrastructure host data Metric group:InfraHostBytes Information related to your servers and virtual machines coming from infrastructure agents, including storage and network data Infrastructure process data stored in ProcessSample. Metric group: InfraProcessBytes Data are metrics related to each process running on the hosts running the Infrastructure agent. This feature is turned off by default. Infrastructure integrations Metric group: InfraIntegrationBytes Performance data related to applications and services, typically managed by the customer, including data related to Docker containers, Windows services, Nagios checks, and cloud integrations such as managed services in AWS, Azure, and GCP. Logging Includes logs and any Log_<value> custom data partition created Metric group: LoggingBytes Log records are stored into the Log event type by default. Additional custom data partitions will create new event types, which are always prefixed with Log_ and will be counted as part of the overall set of log data stored. With LogExtendedRecord, log messages longer than 4KB are split into multiple events that, when needed, are stitched together to display the original message; this reduces the size of message data. As of September 2021, log storage as blobs replaces LogExtendedRecord. With blob storage, NRDB can store up to 128,000 bytes for any attribute, not just messages. For more information, see our blobs documentation for logs.

This way, you'll know your baselines, and can more easily spot an anomaly like an ingest spike, as well as its source. To break down your ingested data, start from the chart on the Data ingestion page. Think of the data source bands as the Y axis, and the dates as the X axis. Click on the band you want to inspect at the spot in the X axis that corresponds with the date you want to investigate. This image shows the Metrics band for June 15 right before it's clicked. A modal opens with the account, data source, and facet selected. You can do a handful of things on this page: Change the account, data source, or facet you want to drill down into. Change the date and time to investigate. Review the results of the query in chart form. The chart displays the top 15 results for the facet query. Open the NRQL query in the Query builder where you'll find additional facets that you can use. Learn more about NRQL queries here. How we break your ingest data down Some of the content in the UI is variable, depending on your account. This information is intended to help you understand how we're working with your ingest data. The chart on the Data ingestion page shows data usage for a little longer time frame than that covered by your retention settings for each data ingest source. If you choose a date outside of your designated retention period for an ingest source, you'll get the message that there's no chart data available. Select a more recent date to fix this problem. If you inspect a data source for an account that has less than a terrabyte of data, we compute the ingest volume over a 24 hour period; otherwise, we compute it for a 1 hour period. The ingest value provided on the main Data ingestion chart will be slightly different from that reflected during inspection. This is because our facet computation is an estimate. Set alerts for data use Query and alert on usage data describes how to set alerts to get notified if you're nearing data ingest limits you don't want to cross. For example, you might set an alert on logs, which can stack up quickly in an active system. Adjust your data ingest Drop data for lower retention costs and data compliance On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. Learn how to set additional data dropping rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules. Turn off agents and integrations If you don’t need data from specific agents or integrations that you have installed, you can uninstall/delete those tools. For instructions, see the specific documentation for an agent or integration.",

This document describes the structure of our dimensional metric data, aka the Metric data type. To learn about how to query this type of data, see Query metrics. Metric types The metric type determines how the data is aggregated over longer time windows. It also determines which functions you can use to query the data. Metric types Description Available query functions count Measures the number of occurrences of an event. The count should be reset to 0 every time the metric is reported. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. You must specify a value for interval.ms when reporting the count metric type using the Metric API. The value must be a positive double. Generally, you want to take the rate of the sum: From Metric select rate(sum(myMetric), 1 minute) . . . sum distribution Tracks the statistical distribution on a numeric attribute. This metric is re-aggregatable. For example, 1-minute data points from 60 minutes can be aggregated into a 1-hour data point, without degradation on accuracy. This type: Supports statistical functions like percentile and histogram, and all functions supported by the summary type. Uses the same algorithm as the percentile function. percentile histogram min max sum count average gauge Represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include the temperature, CPU usage, and memory. For example, there is always a temperature, but you are periodically taking the temperature and reporting it. The value must fit into the range of a Java double. latest min max sum count average summary Used to report pre-aggregated data, or information on aggregated discrete events. A summary includes a count, sum value, min value, and max value. The count value must be positive. Examples include transaction count/durations and queue count/ durations. You must specify a value for interval.ms when reporting the summary metric type using the Metric API. min max sum count average uniqueCount Tracks the number of unique values on a string or numeric attribute. This metric is re-aggregatable. For example, 1-minute data points from 60 minutes can be aggregated into a 1-hour data point, without degradation on accuracy.

      "body": "At New Relic, we're super proud of NRDB, the New Relic database where we store your data. It gathers all your telemetry data in one place, gives you a connected view of all your data, and scales as your business grows. We invite you to send all your metrics, events, logs, and traces to NRDB, including those from third-party sources. We also recognize that some data might not be necessary for your business goals. You shouldn’t have to wade through data you don’t need to get to the data you do. And you definitely shouldn’t have to pay for it. That’s where our data management tools come in: they let you decide what data you send to New Relic and how long it should be stored. Data management hub: from the user profile drop down, select Manage your data. Coupled with user management tools, data management helps you get maximum value from your investment in New Relic, all while safeguarding your data. Important Not yet a New Relic customer? Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Where to find the Data management hub To locate the data management UI: From one.newrelic.com select the account dropdown, and select Manage your data. If you're on the New Relic One user model, you can also find the Data management hub by selecting Administration > Manage data. Better cost, performance, and compliance Collecting and storing data in New Relic allows you to analyze, visualize, and alert on all your metrics, events, logs, and traces from across all of your sources. However, it’s important to manage that data for cost, performance, and in some cases, compliance reasons. The data management hub provides the tools you need to understand and control where your data is coming from, and adjust what’s stored and for how long. Important If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, you'll see your data ingest, retention, and limits in the Data management hub. The primary difference is that you're not billed on ingest, as with our New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which plan you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. Cost management The cost of data storage continually decreases, but storage is still an expense. The amount of data you process and store is closely related to the value you receive from New Relic, because it’s a key component of how you’re charged. Our ingest process helps you hone your data. For example, data might arrive at our processing front door compressed and of varying quality. Through ingest, that data is uncompressed, decorated with queryable attributes, and evaluated. Elements are dropped or trimmed, all before we write it to NRDB. That way, the data you store is only the data you want most. Performance management While NRDB is a phenomenally scalable database, it’s also a reality that queries across huge datasets might not return results in a timely enough fashion for your needs. You get better performance if you limit the data we store, or convert it into a format that keeps it easily queryable. Drop data to improve performance by reducing the amount of data that’s stored. Ingest and retention strategies Depending on your goals, whether to reduce costs, increase specific retention rates, or pare down your data to what’s most essential, we have a strategy for you. Learn about reducing the amount of data that comes into NRDB in Manage data coming into New Relic. Learn about customizing storage so you only store the data you want, for the period you want in Manage data stored in New Relic. Learn about dropping data in Drop data using NerdGraph.

Metric types Description Available query functions count Measures the number of occurrences of an event. The count should be reset to 0 every time the metric is reported. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. You must specify a value for interval.ms when reporting the count metric type using the Metric API. The value must be a positive double. Generally, you want to take the rate of the sum: From Metric select rate(sum(myMetric), 1 minute) . . . sum distribution Tracks the statistical distribution on a numeric attribute. This metric is re-aggregatable. For example, 1-minute data points from 60 minutes can be aggregated into a 1-hour data point, without degradation on accuracy. This type: Supports statistical functions like percentile and histogram, and all functions supported by the summary type. Uses the same algorithm as the percentile function. percentile histogram min max sum count average gauge Represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include the temperature, CPU usage, and memory. For example, there is always a temperature, but you are periodically taking the temperature and reporting it. The value must fit into the range of a Java double. latest min max sum count average summary Used to report pre-aggregated data, or information on aggregated discrete events. A summary includes a count, sum value, min value, and max value. The count value must be positive. Examples include transaction count/durations and queue count/ durations. You must specify a value for interval.ms when reporting the summary metric type using the Metric API. min max sum count average uniqueCount Tracks the number of unique values on a string or numeric attribute. This metric is re-aggregatable. For example, 1-minute data points from 60 minutes can be aggregated into a 1-hour data point, without degradation on accuracy. This type is generated only via the event-to-metrics service. uniqueCount",

It gathers all your telemetry data in one place, gives you a connected view of all your data, and scales as your business grows. We invite you to send all your metrics, events, logs, and traces to NRDB, including those from third-party sources. We also recognize that some data might not be necessary for your business goals. You shouldn’t have to wade through data you don’t need to get to the data you do. And you definitely shouldn’t have to pay for it. That’s where our data management tools come in: they let you decide what data you send to New Relic and how long it should be stored. Data management hub: from the user profile drop down, select Manage your data. Coupled with user management tools, data management helps you get maximum value from your investment in New Relic, all while safeguarding your data. Important Not yet a New Relic customer?

Where to find the Data management hub To locate the data management UI: From one.newrelic.com select the account dropdown, and select Manage your data. If you're on the New Relic One user model, you can also find the Data management hub by selecting Administration > Manage data. Better cost, performance, and compliance Collecting and storing data in New Relic allows you to analyze, visualize, and alert on all your metrics, events, logs, and traces from across all of your sources. However, it’s important to manage that data for cost, performance, and in some cases, compliance reasons. The data management hub provides the tools you need to understand and control where your data is coming from, and adjust what’s stored and for how long. Important If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, you'll see your data ingest, retention, and limits in the Data management hub. The primary difference is that you're not billed on ingest, as with our New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which plan you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. Cost management The cost of data storage continually decreases, but storage is still an expense. The amount of data you process and store is closely related to the value you receive from New Relic, because it’s a key component of how you’re charged. Our ingest process helps you hone your data. For example, data might arrive at our processing front door compressed and of varying quality. Through ingest, that data is uncompressed, decorated with queryable attributes, and evaluated. Elements are dropped or trimmed, all before we write it to NRDB. That way, the data you store is only the data you want most. Performance management While NRDB is a phenomenally scalable database, it’s also a reality that queries across huge datasets might not return results in a timely enough fashion for your needs.

      "body": "When you connect your data to New Relic, we process what we receive and apply data dropping and transformation rules. Then we count the bytes needed to represent your data in a standard format, like JSON. If you're on our New Relic One pricing plan, you're charged by the number of bytes written to our database, above and beyond the standard amount that’s free. Important This doc is for accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan. If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, see Original data retention. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. The Data ingestion page shows your ingest rates for a period you specify on the top-right of the Data management hub. Since 30 days ago is the default setting, but you can also set a custom date span. The page shows your daily average GBs, and the total for the range you set. You can toggle between an overall ingest view and an account view to identify which of your accounts are sending the most data. The page also provides the current month-to-date, and the projected end-of-month total ingest rates. With this information, you can proactively drop data or turn off agents in order to manage ingest and, therefore, costs. If you want to take a look at how we query the data, click the ellipsis icon (just above the chart) to slide out the chart query and open it in our query builder. And If you want to drill down further into your data usage, check out the sample queries in the usage docs. From the Login drop-down, select Manage your data, and then select Data ingestion. This is the Data ingestion page with data source and account views. Data ingestion sources The Data ingestion page describes which of your data sources provide the most data on average and during specific data ranges. The sources are described here. Billable data sources Description Timeslices (1-minute) and Metric:Raw Metrics are timeslices + MetricRaw Metric group: MetricsBytes Metric timeslice data averages to one-hour periods after eight days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in one-hour periods. We currently store the raw metric data for 30 days. You are only billed for the initial ingest volume. You are not billed for subsequent rollups. APM (transactions and errors) APM events Metric group: ApmEventsBytes InfraSamples:Raw Includes multiple Infrastructure events Infrastructure host data Metric group:InfraHostBytes Information related to your servers and virtual machines coming from infrastructure agents, including storage and network data Infrastructure process data stored in ProcessSample. Metric group: InfraProcessBytes Data are metrics related to each process running on the hosts running the Infrastructure agent. This feature is turned off by default. Infrastructure integrations Metric group: InfraIntegrationBytes Performance data related to applications and services, typically managed by the customer, including data related to Docker containers, Windows services, Nagios checks, and cloud integrations such as managed services in AWS, Azure, and GCP. Logging Includes logs and any Log_<value> custom data partition created Metric group: LoggingBytes Log records are stored into the Log event type by default. Additional custom data partitions will create new event types, which are always prefixed with Log_ and will be counted as part of the overall set of log data stored. With LogExtendedRecord, log messages longer than 4KB are split into multiple events that, when needed, are stitched together to display the original message; this reduces the size of message data. As of September 2021, log storage as blobs replaces LogExtendedRecord. With blob storage, NRDB can store up to 128,000 bytes for any attribute, not just messages. For more information, see our blobs documentation for logs. Default Custom events Metric group: CustomEventsBytes Mobile error Mobile general Breadcrumb crash event trails Mobile session Mobile exception Mobile crash Mobile events Metric group: MobileEventsBytes Tracing Metric group: TracingBytes TracingBytes includes Span and OpenTelemetry's SpanEvent. You are not charged for DistributedTraceSummary events. Browser:EventLog Browser Browser:JSErrors PcvPerf (PageView timing) Browser events Metric group: BrowserEventsBytes Lambda Serverless Metric group: ServerlessBytes Break down data to see what's contributing to your ingest You can inspect your data ingest to gain more information about your ingest health. This way, you'll know your baselines, and can more easily spot an anomaly like an ingest spike, as well as its source. To break down your ingested data, start from the chart on the Data ingestion page. Think of the data source bands as the Y axis, and the dates as the X axis. Click on the band you want to inspect at the spot in the X axis that corresponds with the date you want to investigate. This image shows the Metrics band for June 15 right before it's clicked. A modal opens with the account, data source, and facet selected. You can do a handful of things on this page: Change the account, data source, or facet you want to drill down into. Change the date and time to investigate. Review the results of the query in chart form. The chart displays the top 15 results for the facet query. Open the NRQL query in the Query builder where you'll find additional facets that you can use. Learn more about NRQL queries here. How we break your ingest data down Some of the content in the UI is variable, depending on your account. This information is intended to help you understand how we're working with your ingest data. The chart on the Data ingestion page shows data usage for a little longer time frame than that covered by your retention settings for each data ingest source. If you choose a date outside of your designated retention period for an ingest source, you'll get the message that there's no chart data available. Select a more recent date to fix this problem. If you inspect a data source for an account that has less than a terrabyte of data, we compute the ingest volume over a 24 hour period; otherwise, we compute it for a 1 hour period. The ingest value provided on the main Data ingestion chart will be slightly different from that reflected during inspection. This is because our facet computation is an estimate. Set alerts for data use Query and alert on usage data describes how to set alerts to get notified if you're nearing data ingest limits you don't want to cross. For example, you might set an alert on logs, which can stack up quickly in an active system. Adjust your data ingest Drop data for lower retention costs and data compliance On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. Learn how to set additional data dropping rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules. Turn off agents and integrations If you don’t need data from specific agents or integrations that you have installed, you can uninstall/delete those tools. For instructions, see the specific documentation for an agent or integration.",

Important This doc is for accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan. If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, see Original data retention. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. The Data ingestion page shows your ingest rates for a period you specify on the top-right of the Data management hub.

You can toggle between an overall ingest view and an account view to identify which of your accounts are sending the most data. The page also provides the current month-to-date, and the projected end-of-month total ingest rates. With this information, you can proactively drop data or turn off agents in order to manage ingest and, therefore, costs. If you want to take a look at how we query the data, click the ellipsis icon (just above the chart) to slide out the chart query and open it in our query builder. And If you want to drill down further into your data usage, check out the sample queries in the usage docs. From the Login drop-down, select Manage your data, and then select Data ingestion. This is the Data ingestion page with data source and account views. Data ingestion sources The Data ingestion page describes which of your data sources provide the most data on average and during specific data ranges. The sources are described here. Billable data sources Description Timeslices (1-minute) and Metric:Raw Metrics are timeslices + MetricRaw Metric group: MetricsBytes Metric timeslice data averages to one-hour periods after eight days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in one-hour periods. We currently store the raw metric data for 30 days. You are only billed for the initial ingest volume. You are not billed for subsequent rollups. APM (transactions and errors) APM events Metric group: ApmEventsBytes InfraSamples:Raw Includes multiple Infrastructure events Infrastructure host data Metric group:InfraHostBytes Information related to your servers and virtual machines coming from infrastructure agents, including storage and network data Infrastructure process data stored in ProcessSample. Metric group: InfraProcessBytes Data are metrics related to each process running on the hosts running the Infrastructure agent. This feature is turned off by default. Infrastructure integrations Metric group: InfraIntegrationBytes Performance data related to applications and services, typically managed by the customer, including data related to Docker containers, Windows services, Nagios checks, and cloud integrations such as managed services in AWS, Azure, and GCP. Logging Includes logs and any Log_<value> custom data partition created Metric group: LoggingBytes Log records are stored into the Log event type by default. Additional custom data partitions will create new event types, which are always prefixed with Log_ and will be counted as part of the overall set of log data stored. With LogExtendedRecord, log messages longer than 4KB are split into multiple events that, when needed, are stitched together to display the original message; this reduces the size of message data. As of September 2021, log storage as blobs replaces LogExtendedRecord. With blob storage, NRDB can store up to 128,000 bytes for any attribute, not just messages. For more information, see our blobs documentation for logs.

This way, you'll know your baselines, and can more easily spot an anomaly like an ingest spike, as well as its source. To break down your ingested data, start from the chart on the Data ingestion page. Think of the data source bands as the Y axis, and the dates as the X axis. Click on the band you want to inspect at the spot in the X axis that corresponds with the date you want to investigate. This image shows the Metrics band for June 15 right before it's clicked. A modal opens with the account, data source, and facet selected. You can do a handful of things on this page: Change the account, data source, or facet you want to drill down into. Change the date and time to investigate. Review the results of the query in chart form. The chart displays the top 15 results for the facet query. Open the NRQL query in the Query builder where you'll find additional facets that you can use. Learn more about NRQL queries here. How we break your ingest data down Some of the content in the UI is variable, depending on your account. This information is intended to help you understand how we're working with your ingest data. The chart on the Data ingestion page shows data usage for a little longer time frame than that covered by your retention settings for each data ingest source. If you choose a date outside of your designated retention period for an ingest source, you'll get the message that there's no chart data available. Select a more recent date to fix this problem. If you inspect a data source for an account that has less than a terrabyte of data, we compute the ingest volume over a 24 hour period; otherwise, we compute it for a 1 hour period. The ingest value provided on the main Data ingestion chart will be slightly different from that reflected during inspection. This is because our facet computation is an estimate. Set alerts for data use Query and alert on usage data describes how to set alerts to get notified if you're nearing data ingest limits you don't want to cross. For example, you might set an alert on logs, which can stack up quickly in an active system. Adjust your data ingest Drop data for lower retention costs and data compliance On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. Learn how to set additional data dropping rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules. Turn off agents and integrations If you don’t need data from specific agents or integrations that you have installed, you can uninstall/delete those tools. For instructions, see the specific documentation for an agent or integration.",

Examples of gauges include the temperature, CPU usage, and memory. For example, there is always a temperature, but you are periodically taking the temperature and reporting it. The value must fit into the range of a Java double. latest min max sum count average summary Used to report pre-aggregated data, or information on aggregated discrete events. A summary includes a count, sum value, min value, and max value. The count value must be positive. Examples include transaction count/durations and queue count/ durations. You must specify a value for interval.ms when reporting the summary metric type using the Metric API. min max sum count average uniqueCount Tracks the number of unique values on a string or numeric attribute.

      "body": "At New Relic, we're super proud of NRDB, the New Relic database where we store your data. It gathers all your telemetry data in one place, gives you a connected view of all your data, and scales as your business grows. We invite you to send all your metrics, events, logs, and traces to NRDB, including those from third-party sources. We also recognize that some data might not be necessary for your business goals. You shouldn’t have to wade through data you don’t need to get to the data you do. And you definitely shouldn’t have to pay for it. That’s where our data management tools come in: they let you decide what data you send to New Relic and how long it should be stored. Data management hub: from the user profile drop down, select Manage your data. Coupled with user management tools, data management helps you get maximum value from your investment in New Relic, all while safeguarding your data. Important Not yet a New Relic customer? Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Where to find the Data management hub To locate the data management UI: From one.newrelic.com select the account dropdown, and select Manage your data. If you're on the New Relic One user model, you can also find the Data management hub by selecting Administration > Manage data. Better cost, performance, and compliance Collecting and storing data in New Relic allows you to analyze, visualize, and alert on all your metrics, events, logs, and traces from across all of your sources. However, it’s important to manage that data for cost, performance, and in some cases, compliance reasons. The data management hub provides the tools you need to understand and control where your data is coming from, and adjust what’s stored and for how long. Important If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, you'll see your data ingest, retention, and limits in the Data management hub. The primary difference is that you're not billed on ingest, as with our New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which plan you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. Cost management The cost of data storage continually decreases, but storage is still an expense. The amount of data you process and store is closely related to the value you receive from New Relic, because it’s a key component of how you’re charged. Our ingest process helps you hone your data. For example, data might arrive at our processing front door compressed and of varying quality. Through ingest, that data is uncompressed, decorated with queryable attributes, and evaluated. Elements are dropped or trimmed, all before we write it to NRDB. That way, the data you store is only the data you want most. Performance management While NRDB is a phenomenally scalable database, it’s also a reality that queries across huge datasets might not return results in a timely enough fashion for your needs. You get better performance if you limit the data we store, or convert it into a format that keeps it easily queryable. Drop data to improve performance by reducing the amount of data that’s stored. Ingest and retention strategies Depending on your goals, whether to reduce costs, increase specific retention rates, or pare down your data to what’s most essential, we have a strategy for you. Learn about reducing the amount of data that comes into NRDB in Manage data coming into New Relic. Learn about customizing storage so you only store the data you want, for the period you want in Manage data stored in New Relic. Learn about dropping data in Drop data using NerdGraph.

This type: Supports statistical functions like percentile and histogram, and all functions supported by the summary type. Uses the same algorithm as the percentile function. percentile histogram min max sum count average gauge Represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include the temperature, CPU usage, and memory. For example, there is always a temperature, but you are periodically taking the temperature and reporting it. The value must fit into the range of a Java double. latest min max sum count average summary Used to report pre-aggregated data, or information on aggregated discrete events. A summary includes a count, sum value, min value, and max value. The count value must be positive. Examples include transaction count/durations and queue count/ durations. You must specify a value for interval.ms when reporting the summary metric type using the Metric API. min max sum count average uniqueCount Tracks the number of unique values on a string or numeric attribute. This metric is re-aggregatable. For example, 1-minute data points from 60 minutes can be aggregated into a 1-hour data point, without degradation on accuracy. This type is generated only via the event-to-metrics service. uniqueCount",

      "body": "When you connect your data to New Relic, we process what we receive and apply data dropping and transformation rules. Then we count the bytes needed to represent your data in a standard format, like JSON. If you're on our New Relic One pricing plan, you're charged by the number of bytes written to our database, above and beyond the standard amount that’s free. Important This doc is for accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan. If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, see Original data retention. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. The Data ingestion page shows your ingest rates for a period you specify on the top-right of the Data management hub. Since 30 days ago is the default setting, but you can also set a custom date span. The page shows your daily average GBs, and the total for the range you set. You can toggle between an overall ingest view and an account view to identify which of your accounts are sending the most data. The page also provides the current month-to-date, and the projected end-of-month total ingest rates. With this information, you can proactively drop data or turn off agents in order to manage ingest and, therefore, costs. If you want to take a look at how we query the data, click the ellipsis icon (just above the chart) to slide out the chart query and open it in our query builder. And If you want to drill down further into your data usage, check out the sample queries in the usage docs. From the Login drop-down, select Manage your data, and then select Data ingestion. This is the Data ingestion page with data source and account views. Data ingestion sources The Data ingestion page describes which of your data sources provide the most data on average and during specific data ranges. The sources are described here. Billable data sources Description Timeslices (1-minute) and Metric:Raw Metrics are timeslices + MetricRaw Metric group: MetricsBytes Metric timeslice data averages to one-hour periods after eight days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in one-hour periods. We currently store the raw metric data for 30 days. You are only billed for the initial ingest volume. You are not billed for subsequent rollups. APM (transactions and errors) APM events Metric group: ApmEventsBytes InfraSamples:Raw Includes multiple Infrastructure events Infrastructure host data Metric group:InfraHostBytes Information related to your servers and virtual machines coming from infrastructure agents, including storage and network data Infrastructure process data stored in ProcessSample. Metric group: InfraProcessBytes Data are metrics related to each process running on the hosts running the Infrastructure agent. This feature is turned off by default. Infrastructure integrations Metric group: InfraIntegrationBytes Performance data related to applications and services, typically managed by the customer, including data related to Docker containers, Windows services, Nagios checks, and cloud integrations such as managed services in AWS, Azure, and GCP. Logging Includes logs and any Log_<value> custom data partition created Metric group: LoggingBytes Log records are stored into the Log event type by default. Additional custom data partitions will create new event types, which are always prefixed with Log_ and will be counted as part of the overall set of log data stored. With LogExtendedRecord, log messages longer than 4KB are split into multiple events that, when needed, are stitched together to display the original message; this reduces the size of message data. As of September 2021, log storage as blobs replaces LogExtendedRecord. With blob storage, NRDB can store up to 128,000 bytes for any attribute, not just messages. For more information, see our blobs documentation for logs. Default Custom events Metric group: CustomEventsBytes Mobile error Mobile general Breadcrumb crash event trails Mobile session Mobile exception Mobile crash Mobile events Metric group: MobileEventsBytes Tracing Metric group: TracingBytes TracingBytes includes Span and OpenTelemetry's SpanEvent. You are not charged for DistributedTraceSummary events. Browser:EventLog Browser Browser:JSErrors PcvPerf (PageView timing) Browser events Metric group: BrowserEventsBytes Lambda Serverless Metric group: ServerlessBytes Break down data to see what's contributing to your ingest You can inspect your data ingest to gain more information about your ingest health. This way, you'll know your baselines, and can more easily spot an anomaly like an ingest spike, as well as its source. To break down your ingested data, start from the chart on the Data ingestion page. Think of the data source bands as the Y axis, and the dates as the X axis. Click on the band you want to inspect at the spot in the X axis that corresponds with the date you want to investigate. This image shows the Metrics band for June 15 right before it's clicked. A modal opens with the account, data source, and facet selected. You can do a handful of things on this page: Change the account, data source, or facet you want to drill down into. Change the date and time to investigate. Review the results of the query in chart form. The chart displays the top 15 results for the facet query. Open the NRQL query in the Query builder where you'll find additional facets that you can use. Learn more about NRQL queries here. How we break your ingest data down Some of the content in the UI is variable, depending on your account. This information is intended to help you understand how we're working with your ingest data. The chart on the Data ingestion page shows data usage for a little longer time frame than that covered by your retention settings for each data ingest source. If you choose a date outside of your designated retention period for an ingest source, you'll get the message that there's no chart data available. Select a more recent date to fix this problem. If you inspect a data source for an account that has less than a terrabyte of data, we compute the ingest volume over a 24 hour period; otherwise, we compute it for a 1 hour period. The ingest value provided on the main Data ingestion chart will be slightly different from that reflected during inspection. This is because our facet computation is an estimate. Set alerts for data use Query and alert on usage data describes how to set alerts to get notified if you're nearing data ingest limits you don't want to cross. For example, you might set an alert on logs, which can stack up quickly in an active system. Adjust your data ingest Drop data for lower retention costs and data compliance On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. Learn how to set additional data dropping rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules. Turn off agents and integrations If you don’t need data from specific agents or integrations that you have installed, you can uninstall/delete those tools. For instructions, see the specific documentation for an agent or integration.",

Logging Includes logs and any Log_<value> custom data partition created Metric group: LoggingBytes Log records are stored into the Log event type by default. Additional custom data partitions will create new event types, which are always prefixed with Log_ and will be counted as part of the overall set of log data stored. With LogExtendedRecord, log messages longer than 4KB are split into multiple events that, when needed, are stitched together to display the original message; this reduces the size of message data. As of September 2021, log storage as blobs replaces LogExtendedRecord. With blob storage, NRDB can store up to 128,000 bytes for any attribute, not just messages. For more information, see our blobs documentation for logs.

This way, you'll know your baselines, and can more easily spot an anomaly like an ingest spike, as well as its source. To break down your ingested data, start from the chart on the Data ingestion page. Think of the data source bands as the Y axis, and the dates as the X axis. Click on the band you want to inspect at the spot in the X axis that corresponds with the date you want to investigate. This image shows the Metrics band for June 15 right before it's clicked. A modal opens with the account, data source, and facet selected. You can do a handful of things on this page: Change the account, data source, or facet you want to drill down into. Change the date and time to investigate. Review the results of the query in chart form. The chart displays the top 15 results for the facet query. Open the NRQL query in the Query builder where you'll find additional facets that you can use. Learn more about NRQL queries here. How we break your ingest data down Some of the content in the UI is variable, depending on your account. This information is intended to help you understand how we're working with your ingest data. The chart on the Data ingestion page shows data usage for a little longer time frame than that covered by your retention settings for each data ingest source. If you choose a date outside of your designated retention period for an ingest source, you'll get the message that there's no chart data available. Select a more recent date to fix this problem. If you inspect a data source for an account that has less than a terrabyte of data, we compute the ingest volume over a 24 hour period; otherwise, we compute it for a 1 hour period. The ingest value provided on the main Data ingestion chart will be slightly different from that reflected during inspection. This is because our facet computation is an estimate. Set alerts for data use Query and alert on usage data describes how to set alerts to get notified if you're nearing data ingest limits you don't want to cross. For example, you might set an alert on logs, which can stack up quickly in an active system. Adjust your data ingest Drop data for lower retention costs and data compliance On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. Learn how to set additional data dropping rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules. Turn off agents and integrations If you don’t need data from specific agents or integrations that you have installed, you can uninstall/delete those tools. For instructions, see the specific documentation for an agent or integration.",

This document describes the structure of our dimensional metric data, aka the Metric data type. To learn about how to query this type of data, see Query metrics. Metric types The metric type determines how the data is aggregated over longer time windows. It also determines which functions you can use to query the data. Metric types Description Available query functions count Measures the number of occurrences of an event. The count should be reset to 0 every time the metric is reported. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. You must specify a value for interval.ms when reporting the count metric type using the Metric API. The value must be a positive double. Generally, you want to take the rate of the sum: From Metric select rate(sum(myMetric), 1 minute) . . . sum distribution Tracks the statistical distribution on a numeric attribute. This metric is re-aggregatable. For example, 1-minute data points from 60 minutes can be aggregated into a 1-hour data point, without degradation on accuracy. This type: Supports statistical functions like percentile and histogram, and all functions supported by the summary type. Uses the same algorithm as the percentile function. percentile histogram min max sum count average gauge Represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include the temperature, CPU usage, and memory. For example, there is always a temperature, but you are periodically taking the temperature and reporting it. The value must fit into the range of a Java double. latest min max sum count average summary Used to report pre-aggregated data, or information on aggregated discrete events. A summary includes a count, sum value, min value, and max value. The count value must be positive. Examples include transaction count/durations and queue count/ durations. You must specify a value for interval.ms when reporting the summary metric type using the Metric API. min max sum count average uniqueCount Tracks the number of unique values on a string or numeric attribute. This metric is re-aggregatable. For example, 1-minute data points from 60 minutes can be aggregated into a 1-hour data point, without degradation on accuracy.

Requirements and compatibility The Telemetry SDKs use our Metric API, Event API, Log API, and Trace API, which all require a license key, so you'll need a license key for the account you wish to send data to. Tip New Relic has contributed the Telemetry SDK to the open source community under an Apache 2.0 license. Available libraries The Telemetry SDKs are open source software on GitHub. Use the language-specific GitHub links below to get library details, coding examples, and procedures for how to use the SDKs. We currently support the following libraries, with more to be created in the future: Language Library Supported New Relic data types Java Java library on GitHub Metrics Events Logs Traces Node/TypeScript NodeJS library on GitHub Metrics Traces Python Python library on GitHub Metrics Events Logs Traces Go Go library on Github Metrics Traces .NET .NET library on GitHub .NET package in NuGet Metrics Traces C C library on Github Traces Rust Rust library on Github Traces Ruby Ruby library on Github Gem on Rubygems Traces For more on the supported data types, see: An overview of New Relic data types Metrics: see the Metric API Logs: see the Log API Traces: see the Trace API Events: see the Event API Write your own Telemetry SDK or contribute to an existing one If you need a Telemetry SDK in a language that does not currently exist or want to contribute to an existing library, please see the Telemetry SDK specifications.

      "body": "When you connect your data to New Relic, we process what we receive and apply data dropping and transformation rules. Then we count the bytes needed to represent your data in a standard format, like JSON. If you're on our New Relic One pricing plan, you're charged by the number of bytes written to our database, above and beyond the standard amount that’s free. Important This doc is for accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan. If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, see Original data retention. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. The Data ingestion page shows your ingest rates for a period you specify on the top-right of the Data management hub. Since 30 days ago is the default setting, but you can also set a custom date span. The page shows your daily average GBs, and the total for the range you set. You can toggle between an overall ingest view and an account view to identify which of your accounts are sending the most data. The page also provides the current month-to-date, and the projected end-of-month total ingest rates. With this information, you can proactively drop data or turn off agents in order to manage ingest and, therefore, costs. If you want to take a look at how we query the data, click the ellipsis icon (just above the chart) to slide out the chart query and open it in our query builder. And If you want to drill down further into your data usage, check out the sample queries in the usage docs. From the Login drop-down, select Manage your data, and then select Data ingestion. This is the Data ingestion page with data source and account views. Data ingestion sources The Data ingestion page describes which of your data sources provide the most data on average and during specific data ranges. The sources are described here. Billable data sources Description Timeslices (1-minute) and Metric:Raw Metrics are timeslices + MetricRaw Metric group: MetricsBytes Metric timeslice data averages to one-hour periods after eight days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in one-hour periods. We currently store the raw metric data for 30 days. You are only billed for the initial ingest volume. You are not billed for subsequent rollups. APM (transactions and errors) APM events Metric group: ApmEventsBytes InfraSamples:Raw Includes multiple Infrastructure events Infrastructure host data Metric group:InfraHostBytes Information related to your servers and virtual machines coming from infrastructure agents, including storage and network data Infrastructure process data stored in ProcessSample. Metric group: InfraProcessBytes Data are metrics related to each process running on the hosts running the Infrastructure agent. This feature is turned off by default. Infrastructure integrations Metric group: InfraIntegrationBytes Performance data related to applications and services, typically managed by the customer, including data related to Docker containers, Windows services, Nagios checks, and cloud integrations such as managed services in AWS, Azure, and GCP. Logging Includes logs and any Log_<value> custom data partition created Metric group: LoggingBytes Log records are stored into the Log event type by default. Additional custom data partitions will create new event types, which are always prefixed with Log_ and will be counted as part of the overall set of log data stored. With LogExtendedRecord, log messages longer than 4KB are split into multiple events that, when needed, are stitched together to display the original message; this reduces the size of message data. As of September 2021, log storage as blobs replaces LogExtendedRecord. With blob storage, NRDB can store up to 128,000 bytes for any attribute, not just messages. For more information, see our blobs documentation for logs. Default Custom events Metric group: CustomEventsBytes Mobile error Mobile general Breadcrumb crash event trails Mobile session Mobile exception Mobile crash Mobile events Metric group: MobileEventsBytes Tracing Metric group: TracingBytes TracingBytes includes Span and OpenTelemetry's SpanEvent. You are not charged for DistributedTraceSummary events. Browser:EventLog Browser Browser:JSErrors PcvPerf (PageView timing) Browser events Metric group: BrowserEventsBytes Lambda Serverless Metric group: ServerlessBytes Break down data to see what's contributing to your ingest You can inspect your data ingest to gain more information about your ingest health. This way, you'll know your baselines, and can more easily spot an anomaly like an ingest spike, as well as its source. To break down your ingested data, start from the chart on the Data ingestion page. Think of the data source bands as the Y axis, and the dates as the X axis. Click on the band you want to inspect at the spot in the X axis that corresponds with the date you want to investigate. This image shows the Metrics band for June 15 right before it's clicked. A modal opens with the account, data source, and facet selected. You can do a handful of things on this page: Change the account, data source, or facet you want to drill down into. Change the date and time to investigate. Review the results of the query in chart form. The chart displays the top 15 results for the facet query. Open the NRQL query in the Query builder where you'll find additional facets that you can use. Learn more about NRQL queries here. How we break your ingest data down Some of the content in the UI is variable, depending on your account. This information is intended to help you understand how we're working with your ingest data. The chart on the Data ingestion page shows data usage for a little longer time frame than that covered by your retention settings for each data ingest source. If you choose a date outside of your designated retention period for an ingest source, you'll get the message that there's no chart data available. Select a more recent date to fix this problem. If you inspect a data source for an account that has less than a terrabyte of data, we compute the ingest volume over a 24 hour period; otherwise, we compute it for a 1 hour period. The ingest value provided on the main Data ingestion chart will be slightly different from that reflected during inspection. This is because our facet computation is an estimate. Set alerts for data use Query and alert on usage data describes how to set alerts to get notified if you're nearing data ingest limits you don't want to cross. For example, you might set an alert on logs, which can stack up quickly in an active system. Adjust your data ingest Drop data for lower retention costs and data compliance On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. Learn how to set additional data dropping rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules. Turn off agents and integrations If you don’t need data from specific agents or integrations that you have installed, you can uninstall/delete those tools. For instructions, see the specific documentation for an agent or integration.",

This document describes the structure of our dimensional metric data, aka the Metric data type. To learn about how to query this type of data, see Query metrics. Metric types The metric type determines how the data is aggregated over longer time windows. It also determines which functions you can use to query the data. Metric types Description Available query functions count Measures the number of occurrences of an event. The count should be reset to 0 every time the metric is reported. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. You must specify a value for interval.ms when reporting the count metric type using the Metric API. The value must be a positive double. Generally, you want to take the rate of the sum: From Metric select rate(sum(myMetric), 1 minute) . . . sum distribution Tracks the statistical distribution on a numeric attribute. This metric is re-aggregatable. For example, 1-minute data points from 60 minutes can be aggregated into a 1-hour data point, without degradation on accuracy. This type: Supports statistical functions like percentile and histogram, and all functions supported by the summary type. Uses the same algorithm as the percentile function. percentile histogram min max sum count average gauge Represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include the temperature, CPU usage, and memory. For example, there is always a temperature, but you are periodically taking the temperature and reporting it. The value must fit into the range of a Java double. latest min max sum count average summary Used to report pre-aggregated data, or information on aggregated discrete events. A summary includes a count, sum value, min value, and max value. The count value must be positive. Examples include transaction count/durations and queue count/ durations. You must specify a value for interval.ms when reporting the summary metric type using the Metric API. min max sum count average uniqueCount Tracks the number of unique values on a string or numeric attribute. This metric is re-aggregatable. For example, 1-minute data points from 60 minutes can be aggregated into a 1-hour data point, without degradation on accuracy. This type is generated only via the event-to-metrics service. uniqueCount",

This document describes the structure of our dimensional metric data, aka the Metric data type. To learn about how to query this type of data, see Query metrics. Metric types The metric type determines how the data is aggregated over longer time windows. It also determines which functions you can use to query the data. Metric types Description Available query functions count Measures the number of occurrences of an event. The count should be reset to 0 every time the metric is reported. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. You must specify a value for interval.ms when reporting the count metric type using the Metric API. The value must be a positive double. Generally, you want to take the rate of the sum: From Metric select rate(sum(myMetric), 1 minute) . . . sum distribution Tracks the statistical distribution on a numeric attribute. This metric is re-aggregatable. For example, 1-minute data points from 60 minutes can be aggregated into a 1-hour data point, without degradation on accuracy. This type: Supports statistical functions like percentile and histogram, and all functions supported by the summary type. Uses the same algorithm as the percentile function. percentile histogram min max sum count average gauge Represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include the temperature, CPU usage, and memory. For example, there is always a temperature, but you are periodically taking the temperature and reporting it. The value must fit into the range of a Java double. latest min max sum count average summary Used to report pre-aggregated data, or information on aggregated discrete events. A summary includes a count, sum value, min value, and max value. The count value must be positive. Examples include transaction count/durations and queue count/ durations. You must specify a value for interval.ms when reporting the summary metric type using the Metric API. min max sum count average uniqueCount Tracks the number of unique values on a string or numeric attribute. This metric is re-aggregatable. For example, 1-minute data points from 60 minutes can be aggregated into a 1-hour data point, without degradation on accuracy.

Want to try out our Metric API? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. What is the Metric API? The Metric API is a way to get metric data into New Relic. The API works by sending a POST request to our HTTP endpoint with a JSON payload containing the metric data. The Metric API is how metrics are ingested from some of our integrations, including our open source exporters (like DropWizard, OpenCensus, and Prometheus). The Metric API is also used by our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that make it easier to use our data-ingest APIs. The Metric API can be used to: Report metric data to New Relic without a New Relic agent. Integrate metric data from an open source or in-house developed tool, library, or framework. Fully control the metric data you're sending, including the resolution and associated dimensions. Leverage the power of NRQL, New Relic's query language, for querying your metric data. Set up alerts for your metric data. Requirements Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name metric-api.newrelic.com or metric-api.eu.newrelic.com. You'll need a New Relic license key for the New Relic account you want to send data to. For information on limits and restricted attributes, see Metric API requirements and limits. Get started If we don't have an existing integration that meets your metric-reporting needs, you have two options: Use our Telemetry SDKs, which are language-specific tools that help you send us metrics and other data. Use the Metric API directly. Find and use your data You can find data sent via the Metric API (including from integrations that use this API) in these locations: From one.newrelic.com, select Explorer and look for your service. By querying the Metric data type. For example, you can use NRQL to run: SELECT * FROM Metric Copy For more on querying, see Metric query examples. For information on querying in general, see Query data. Alert on metric data To alert on metrics created with the Metric API, use NRQL alert conditions: Select the NRQL category when defining your condition, then use the FROM Metric ... NRQL query syntax to express it. When you create these alert conditions, Alerts automatically uses the finest granularity data available (the raw metric data points) to evaluate alerts. Data retention All raw metric data points will be retained for 30 days. All additional aggregated data derived from the raw metric data points (for example, one-minute rollups) will be retained for 13 months. Any change to the retention period beyond such periods may result in a charge to you. Troubleshooting See Troubleshoot an NrIntegrationError event.",

      "body": "You can drop data you don't want to keep by changing the remote_write section of the YAML config file. Tip You can also drop remote write data using NerdGraph. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph. Drop entire metric data points from remote write integration If a target is sending a noisy metric that you don't want sent to New Relic, you can specify that New Relic should drop that data. Example Let's say you don't want to receive data for the metric node_memory_active_bytes from an instance running at localhost:9100. Using the write_relabel_config entry shown below, you can target the metric name using the __name__ label in combination with the instance name. remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=macbook-server-cluster bearer_token: <redacted> write_relabel_configs: - source_labels: ['__name__', 'instance'] regex: 'node_memory_active_bytes;localhost:9100' action: 'drop' Copy This tells Prometheus that you want to do some action against metrics with these labels. To limit which metrics with these labels are affected, you must include some value for regex. By default this value is set to .* and it will include all metrics. In this case, it will drop all metric data points coming out of Prometheus via remote write. Drop specific labels or attributes from data points If a target is sending specific labels or attributes you're not interested in receiving, you can drop these from the metrics you receive. Example Let's say one of your targets is sending a bunch of extra attributes you're not interested in receiving. These might include things like high cardinality attributes such as unique machine identifiers, JVM IDs, or similar. In this case, you need to change both the remote_write and the scrape_configs section of the YAML file. The result will look something like this: remote_write: - url: https://metric-api.newrelic.com/prometheus/v1/write?prometheus_server=macbook-server-cluster bearer_token: <redacted> write_relabel_configs: - regex: 'extraLabelToRemove.*' action: 'labeldrop' ... scrape_configs: # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config. - job_name: 'node' # Override the global default and scrape targets from this job every 5 seconds. scrape_interval: 5s static_configs: - targets: ['localhost:9100'] labels: group: 'production' keepLabelName1: 'please-keep-me' extraLabelToRemove: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove1: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove2: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove4: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove3: 'please-remove-me' extraLabelToRemove5: 'please-remove-me' Copy Prometheus or NerdGraph? There are advantages to both dropping data using the method described on this page and using NerdGraph. This section is intended to help you figure out which method is better for your specific needs and preferences. Considerations for the Prometheus config file method With this method, your dropped data never leaves the associated Prometheus instance. This is a valuable feature if bytes transferred is a cost consideration on the app hosting side. However, this method may be less appealing than the NerdGraph option due to the following considerations: Maintained via config yaml files that need to be loaded onto each Prometheus instance (or via a shared storage mechanism) Requires access to Prometheus server, meaning that either: The server needs to be restarted Served must be be accessed at port with path /-/reload (assuming the server has lifecycle management enabled as described here in the Prometheus configuration docs. Considerations the NerdGraph method NerdGraph is a great option if you want to manage all your data dropping in a single place. It can also be updated easily via the API and requires no restart or interaction with Prometheus. However, this method applies rules to all incoming data points. This means that you should set up your rules with careful consideration using WHERE filtering. For more information, see Drop data using NerdGraph.

      "body": "At New Relic, we're super proud of NRDB, the New Relic database where we store your data. It gathers all your telemetry data in one place, gives you a connected view of all your data, and scales as your business grows. We invite you to send all your metrics, events, logs, and traces to NRDB, including those from third-party sources. We also recognize that some data might not be necessary for your business goals. You shouldn’t have to wade through data you don’t need to get to the data you do. And you definitely shouldn’t have to pay for it. That’s where our data management tools come in: they let you decide what data you send to New Relic and how long it should be stored. Data management hub: from the user profile drop down, select Manage your data. Coupled with user management tools, data management helps you get maximum value from your investment in New Relic, all while safeguarding your data. Important Not yet a New Relic customer? Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Where to find the Data management hub To locate the data management UI: From one.newrelic.com select the account dropdown, and select Manage your data. If you're on the New Relic One user model, you can also find the Data management hub by selecting Administration > Manage data. Better cost, performance, and compliance Collecting and storing data in New Relic allows you to analyze, visualize, and alert on all your metrics, events, logs, and traces from across all of your sources. However, it’s important to manage that data for cost, performance, and in some cases, compliance reasons. The data management hub provides the tools you need to understand and control where your data is coming from, and adjust what’s stored and for how long. Important If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, you'll see your data ingest, retention, and limits in the Data management hub. The primary difference is that you're not billed on ingest, as with our New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which plan you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. Cost management The cost of data storage continually decreases, but storage is still an expense. The amount of data you process and store is closely related to the value you receive from New Relic, because it’s a key component of how you’re charged. Our ingest process helps you hone your data. For example, data might arrive at our processing front door compressed and of varying quality. Through ingest, that data is uncompressed, decorated with queryable attributes, and evaluated. Elements are dropped or trimmed, all before we write it to NRDB. That way, the data you store is only the data you want most. Performance management While NRDB is a phenomenally scalable database, it’s also a reality that queries across huge datasets might not return results in a timely enough fashion for your needs. You get better performance if you limit the data we store, or convert it into a format that keeps it easily queryable. Drop data to improve performance by reducing the amount of data that’s stored. Ingest and retention strategies Depending on your goals, whether to reduce costs, increase specific retention rates, or pare down your data to what’s most essential, we have a strategy for you. Learn about reducing the amount of data that comes into NRDB in Manage data coming into New Relic.

This document describes the structure of our dimensional metric data, aka the Metric data type. To learn about how to query this type of data, see Query metrics. Metric types The metric type determines how the data is aggregated over longer time windows. It also determines which functions you can use to query the data. Metric types Description Available query functions count Measures the number of occurrences of an event. The count should be reset to 0 every time the metric is reported. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. You must specify a value for interval.ms when reporting the count metric type using the Metric API. The value must be a positive double. Generally, you want to take the rate of the sum: From Metric select rate(sum(myMetric), 1 minute) . . . sum distribution Tracks the statistical distribution on a numeric attribute. This metric is re-aggregatable. For example, 1-minute data points from 60 minutes can be aggregated into a 1-hour data point, without degradation on accuracy. This type: Supports statistical functions like percentile and histogram, and all functions supported by the summary type. Uses the same algorithm as the percentile function. percentile histogram min max sum count average gauge Represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include the temperature, CPU usage, and memory. For example, there is always a temperature, but you are periodically taking the temperature and reporting it. The value must fit into the range of a Java double. latest min max sum count average summary Used to report pre-aggregated data, or information on aggregated discrete events. A summary includes a count, sum value, min value, and max value. The count value must be positive. Examples include transaction count/durations and queue count/ durations. You must specify a value for interval.ms when reporting the summary metric type using the Metric API. min max sum count average uniqueCount Tracks the number of unique values on a string or numeric attribute. This metric is re-aggregatable. For example, 1-minute data points from 60 minutes can be aggregated into a 1-hour data point, without degradation on accuracy.

      "body": "At New Relic, we're super proud of NRDB, the New Relic database where we store your data. It gathers all your telemetry data in one place, gives you a connected view of all your data, and scales as your business grows. We invite you to send all your metrics, events, logs, and traces to NRDB, including those from third-party sources. We also recognize that some data might not be necessary for your business goals. You shouldn’t have to wade through data you don’t need to get to the data you do. And you definitely shouldn’t have to pay for it. That’s where our data management tools come in: they let you decide what data you send to New Relic and how long it should be stored. Data management hub: from the user profile drop down, select Manage your data. Coupled with user management tools, data management helps you get maximum value from your investment in New Relic, all while safeguarding your data. Important Not yet a New Relic customer? Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Where to find the Data management hub To locate the data management UI: From one.newrelic.com select the account dropdown, and select Manage your data. If you're on the New Relic One user model, you can also find the Data management hub by selecting Administration > Manage data. Better cost, performance, and compliance Collecting and storing data in New Relic allows you to analyze, visualize, and alert on all your metrics, events, logs, and traces from across all of your sources. However, it’s important to manage that data for cost, performance, and in some cases, compliance reasons. The data management hub provides the tools you need to understand and control where your data is coming from, and adjust what’s stored and for how long. Important If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, you'll see your data ingest, retention, and limits in the Data management hub. The primary difference is that you're not billed on ingest, as with our New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which plan you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. Cost management The cost of data storage continually decreases, but storage is still an expense. The amount of data you process and store is closely related to the value you receive from New Relic, because it’s a key component of how you’re charged. Our ingest process helps you hone your data. For example, data might arrive at our processing front door compressed and of varying quality. Through ingest, that data is uncompressed, decorated with queryable attributes, and evaluated. Elements are dropped or trimmed, all before we write it to NRDB. That way, the data you store is only the data you want most. Performance management While NRDB is a phenomenally scalable database, it’s also a reality that queries across huge datasets might not return results in a timely enough fashion for your needs. You get better performance if you limit the data we store, or convert it into a format that keeps it easily queryable. Drop data to improve performance by reducing the amount of data that’s stored. Ingest and retention strategies Depending on your goals, whether to reduce costs, increase specific retention rates, or pare down your data to what’s most essential, we have a strategy for you. Learn about reducing the amount of data that comes into NRDB in Manage data coming into New Relic.

      "body": "To ensure our systems are always up and ready to support you, and to keep you from unintended use, we place limits on the amount of data you can send, query, and store. Responses to limit violations Limits are enforced per child account, and across our APIs. You might reach a limit if you start monitoring a new high-traffic application, or have a sudden data spike. When you do reach a limit, New Relic responds according to the type of data and the limit that’s reached. For example: We place a limit on the number of ingested requests per minute (RPM) per data type. When this limit is reached, we stop accepting data and return a 429 status code for the duration of the minute. For queries, we place limits on the number of queries per minute and the number of records inspected (see query limits). When the number of queries per minute limit is reached, New Relic will begin rejecting queries until the number of queries is below the limit. When the records inspected limit is reached, New Relic will reject traffic from the source scanning the largest number of records and attempt to allow traffic from other sources. For metrics, we place a limit on the number of unique timeseries (cardinality) per account and per metric. When this limit is reached, aggregated data is turned off for the rest of the UTC day. For every major limit violation, New Relic creates an NrIntegrationError event for that account, which has these limit-related attributes: Attribute Description category RateLimit or ApiLimit. The RateLimit category is used for limits based on a unit of time such as the number of requests ingested per minute. The ApiLimit is used for constant limits, such as the number of attributes on a record. limitName The name of the limit. message Describes the limit and the impact. limitValue The limit reached. System limits UI The system Limits page (from the account dropdown, click Manage your data and click Limits on the left) displays when your account has encountered a rate limit in the specified time period. The page displays a default period of 24 hours; you can set a custom range from the top-right of the page. Non-limit-related NrIntegrationError events are not displayed here. In addition, this page does not display information about limits you have not hit, or how close you are to reaching a limit.

To add more detail, or build a dashboard, click the View NRQL button on the chart to see the NRQL powering this view. The graph displays each unique limit type that was reached during the selected time-period. This can help you find any trends based on time. The Limits page also provides a table where you can find the limit name, the limit event message associated with it, and last occurrence time and date.

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Migrate from Insights Dashboard API to NerdGraph Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) Data partitions Manage data partitions Date retention Manage data retention NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "Important This doc is for accounts on our original pricing plan, not our New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing plans. For organizations on New Relic One pricing, our various New Relic products report a wide range of event data. Different products have different data retention periods, and different ways to extend event data retention. You can customize the length of your event data retention through flexible event retention. Data retention UI For how to find the data retention UI, see Manage data. Overview of event data retention All New Relic product subscriptions come with a certain level of data retention that governs how long different types of data are retained. One type of data governed by data retention rules is event data. Event data is available in some UI charts and tables, and also available for querying via NRQL, our querying language. There are events reported from products by default, and there are custom events: each have their own retention rules, depending on the product and subscription level. Here are some examples of how different product subscriptions can affect event data retention: Free/Lite APM subscription: default-reported events available for 1 day. No custom events available. Pro APM subscription: default-reported events available for 8 days. Custom events available for 1 day (and able to be extended with Insight Pro). To see your subscriptions, go to the Account summary page. Extend your event retention Product Method APM, Browser, and Mobile Event data retention can be extended with a paid subscription to these products (see product data retention). To extend retention of both default-reported events and custom events further, you need an Insights Pro subscription. Infrastructure Event data retention can be extended with a paid Infrastructure subscription. See Infrastructure data retention rules. Synthetics Event data retention can be extended with a paid Synthetics subscription. See Synthetics data retention rules. Custom events Custom events reported by agent APIs or the Event API: Extension requires an Insights Pro subscription. Insights Pro Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. A paid Insights subscription is what governs the extension of event data retention for: Our APM, Browser, Mobile, and Serverless products Custom events that come from an agent API or from the Event API Important Note that having an Insights Pro subscription doesn't require use of the Insights UI (insights.newrelic.com) to query your data: there are other querying options available. To see the data retention governed by your Insights subscription: go to the usage UI and select Insights usage. With an Insights Pro subscription, you can use flexible retention to customize how your event data is retained. This lets you keep only the data you need, for as long as you need it. How number of events stored is calculated This is an explanation of how the number of stored events are calculated by default for an Insights Pro subscription. (Note that with flexible retention, you have more fine-grained control over the retention period.) The events stored is calculated based on 1) total events stored over time (calculated based on the events generated per week) and 2) the weeks of data retention available. This equation can be represented like this: events stored = (events generated per week) * (weeks of retention) Copy An Insights Pro subscription provides a given number of weeks of data retention as well as a given number of events over that retention period. For example: (200M transactions per week) * (4 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights (16M transactions per week) * (50 weeks of retention) = 800M events stored in Insights For Insights Pro subscriptions, data is purged based on retention window, not volume. It is deleted from the system once it's past the retention window. For example: If your Insights license is for 800 million events with a 4 week retention period, your data would start being purged after it is older than four weeks. Temporary spikes in data exceeding your subscription level will still be recorded, but consistent overage should be solved by upgrading your subscription level or decreasing data collected. For customers without an Insights Pro subscription, New Relic may throttle or downsample events to a limit of not more than than 4,000 events per host per minute. Insights Pro event overage example In this example, you have an Insights Pro subscription with a license for 800 million events over 4 weeks, a rate of 200 million events per week. You have APM Pro, Browser Pro, and Mobile Enterprise. A fifth week of data is added via your subscriptions, bumping you to a total of 1 billion events stored within your plan: If you are using 975 million events, you are not over your retention. If you are using 1.25 billion events, you are over your retention. Disable/enable Transaction and Pageview event reporting Tip Owners or Admins The Insights Data summary UI page is used to see the types of events being reported. You can also use this page to enable and disable the reporting of PageView and Transaction events. To view Data summary: Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data. Select the Summary tab. Note: if you disable PageView or Transaction event reporting, this can affect some New Relic UI elements. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data. Go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > Summary. From the Summary tab, select Configure data sources. Toggle the appropriate switch on or off, then save. Toggling Transaction on or off will cause reporting agents to restart themselves. For more about configuring event reporting, see Event data retention. Flexible data retention With an Insights Pro subscription, you get access to flexible retention, which lets you define how some types of event data are retained. This lets you keep only the event data you need, for as long as you need it. You can manage your flexible retention through the UI or through our GraphQL API. Requirements to use this feature: An Insights Pro subscription or equivalent trial. Applies only for events governed by an Insights Pro subscription. To use this feature, you must be an account Owner or data retention add-on manager for your account. How it works To understand how standard event data retention works, first read Event data retention. With flexible retention, you specify the data retention for applicable event namespaces across your accounts. This gives you per-event namespace control of your data. The retention that you specify for an event namespace will be shared by all the event types under that namespace. If some namespaces are not relevant to you, you can avoid collecting their event data entirely. Your retention value can’t be lower than the included retention or higher than the default retention. You can control data retention either in our UI or by API. Manage retention via UI You can control data retention either using our GraphQL API or in the UI. To do this with the UI, go to the data retention UI. Your retention changes take effect within 24 hours after updating. Glossary To understand the terms used with flexible retention, see the following: Term Description Event namespace An event's namespace corresponds to one or more event types that share a single data retention value. For more information, see Event namespaces (types). You can also use NerdGraph to get the list of customizable event namespaces. Retention value The number (in days) that specifies how long your event data is stored. Retention rule The event namespace and retention value pair that you specify to override the current retention. Licensed retention Retention period that’s determined in weeks by your Insights Pro subscription contract. Included retention Retention period for which your data is stored but not charged under the Insights Pro subscription. For details, see the data retention details for a specific product. Paid retention Retention period for which your data is stored and is charged under the Insights Pro subscription. By default, your licensed retention determines this value but Flexible retention lets you override it. Default retention Retention period that comes out of the box. This is based on the total of included retention plus licensed retention. For information on managing retention settings with APIs, see the Manage data retention documentation. For more help For details about the data retention of other products or integrations, see that specific documentation.",

      "body": "When you connect your data to New Relic, we process what we receive and apply data dropping and transformation rules. Then we count the bytes needed to represent your data in a standard format, like JSON. If you're on our New Relic One pricing plan, you're charged by the number of bytes written to our database, above and beyond the standard amount that’s free. Important This doc is for accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan. If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, see Original data retention. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. The Data ingestion page shows your ingest rates for a period you specify on the top-right of the Data management hub. Since 30 days ago is the default setting, but you can also set a custom date span. The page shows your daily average GBs, and the total for the range you set. You can toggle between an overall ingest view and an account view to identify which of your accounts are sending the most data. The page also provides the current month-to-date, and the projected end-of-month total ingest rates. With this information, you can proactively drop data or turn off agents in order to manage ingest and, therefore, costs. If you want to take a look at how we query the data, click the ellipsis icon (just above the chart) to slide out the chart query and open it in our query builder. And If you want to drill down further into your data usage, check out the sample queries in the usage docs. From the Login drop-down, select Manage your data, and then select Data ingestion. This is the Data ingestion page with data source and account views. Data ingestion sources The Data ingestion page describes which of your data sources provide the most data on average and during specific data ranges. The sources are described here. Billable data sources Description Timeslices (1-minute) and Metric:Raw Metrics are timeslices + MetricRaw Metric group: MetricsBytes Metric timeslice data averages to one-hour periods after eight days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in one-hour periods. We currently store the raw metric data for 30 days. You are only billed for the initial ingest volume. You are not billed for subsequent rollups. APM (transactions and errors) APM events Metric group: ApmEventsBytes InfraSamples:Raw Includes multiple Infrastructure events Infrastructure host data Metric group:InfraHostBytes Information related to your servers and virtual machines coming from infrastructure agents, including storage and network data Infrastructure process data stored in ProcessSample. Metric group: InfraProcessBytes Data are metrics related to each process running on the hosts running the Infrastructure agent. This feature is turned off by default. Infrastructure integrations Metric group: InfraIntegrationBytes Performance data related to applications and services, typically managed by the customer, including data related to Docker containers, Windows services, Nagios checks, and cloud integrations such as managed services in AWS, Azure, and GCP. Logging Includes logs and any Log_<value> custom data partition created Metric group: LoggingBytes Log records are stored into the Log event type by default. Additional custom data partitions will create new event types, which are always prefixed with Log_ and will be counted as part of the overall set of log data stored. With LogExtendedRecord, log messages longer than 4KB are split into multiple events that, when needed, are stitched together to display the original message; this reduces the size of message data. As of September 2021, log storage as blobs replaces LogExtendedRecord. With blob storage, NRDB can store up to 128,000 bytes for any attribute, not just messages. For more information, see our blobs documentation for logs. Default Custom events Metric group: CustomEventsBytes Mobile error Mobile general Breadcrumb crash event trails Mobile session Mobile exception Mobile crash Mobile events Metric group: MobileEventsBytes Tracing Metric group: TracingBytes TracingBytes includes Span and OpenTelemetry's SpanEvent. You are not charged for DistributedTraceSummary events. Browser:EventLog Browser Browser:JSErrors PcvPerf (PageView timing) Browser events Metric group: BrowserEventsBytes Lambda Serverless Metric group: ServerlessBytes Break down data to see what's contributing to your ingest You can inspect your data ingest to gain more information about your ingest health. This way, you'll know your baselines, and can more easily spot an anomaly like an ingest spike, as well as its source. To break down your ingested data, start from the chart on the Data ingestion page. Think of the data source bands as the Y axis, and the dates as the X axis. Click on the band you want to inspect at the spot in the X axis that corresponds with the date you want to investigate. This image shows the Metrics band for June 15 right before it's clicked. A modal opens with the account, data source, and facet selected. You can do a handful of things on this page: Change the account, data source, or facet you want to drill down into. Change the date and time to investigate. Review the results of the query in chart form. The chart displays the top 15 results for the facet query. Open the NRQL query in the Query builder where you'll find additional facets that you can use. Learn more about NRQL queries here. How we break your ingest data down Some of the content in the UI is variable, depending on your account. This information is intended to help you understand how we're working with your ingest data. The chart on the Data ingestion page shows data usage for a little longer time frame than that covered by your retention settings for each data ingest source. If you choose a date outside of your designated retention period for an ingest source, you'll get the message that there's no chart data available. Select a more recent date to fix this problem. If you inspect a data source for an account that has less than a terrabyte of data, we compute the ingest volume over a 24 hour period; otherwise, we compute it for a 1 hour period. The ingest value provided on the main Data ingestion chart will be slightly different from that reflected during inspection. This is because our facet computation is an estimate. Set alerts for data use Query and alert on usage data describes how to set alerts to get notified if you're nearing data ingest limits you don't want to cross. For example, you might set an alert on logs, which can stack up quickly in an active system. Adjust your data ingest Drop data for lower retention costs and data compliance On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. Learn how to set additional data dropping rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules. Turn off agents and integrations If you don’t need data from specific agents or integrations that you have installed, you can uninstall/delete those tools. For instructions, see the specific documentation for an agent or integration.",

This document describes the structure of our dimensional metric data, aka the Metric data type. To learn about how to query this type of data, see Query metrics. Metric types The metric type determines how the data is aggregated over longer time windows. It also determines which functions you can use to query the data. Metric types Description Available query functions count Measures the number of occurrences of an event. The count should be reset to 0 every time the metric is reported. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. You must specify a value for interval.ms when reporting the count metric type using the Metric API. The value must be a positive double. Generally, you want to take the rate of the sum: From Metric select rate(sum(myMetric), 1 minute) . . . sum distribution Tracks the statistical distribution on a numeric attribute. This metric is re-aggregatable. For example, 1-minute data points from 60 minutes can be aggregated into a 1-hour data point, without degradation on accuracy. This type: Supports statistical functions like percentile and histogram, and all functions supported by the summary type. Uses the same algorithm as the percentile function. percentile histogram min max sum count average gauge Represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include the temperature, CPU usage, and memory. For example, there is always a temperature, but you are periodically taking the temperature and reporting it. The value must fit into the range of a Java double. latest min max sum count average summary Used to report pre-aggregated data, or information on aggregated discrete events. A summary includes a count, sum value, min value, and max value. The count value must be positive. Examples include transaction count/durations and queue count/ durations. You must specify a value for interval.ms when reporting the summary metric type using the Metric API. min max sum count average uniqueCount Tracks the number of unique values on a string or numeric attribute.

      "body": "To ensure our systems are always up and ready to support you, and to keep you from unintended use, we place limits on the amount of data you can send, query, and store. Responses to limit violations Limits are enforced per child account, and across our APIs. You might reach a limit if you start monitoring a new high-traffic application, or have a sudden data spike. When you do reach a limit, New Relic responds according to the type of data and the limit that’s reached. For example: We place a limit on the number of ingested requests per minute (RPM) per data type. When this limit is reached, we stop accepting data and return a 429 status code for the duration of the minute. For queries, we place limits on the number of queries per minute and the number of records inspected (see query limits). When the number of queries per minute limit is reached, New Relic will begin rejecting queries until the number of queries is below the limit. When the records inspected limit is reached, New Relic will reject traffic from the source scanning the largest number of records and attempt to allow traffic from other sources. For metrics, we place a limit on the number of unique timeseries (cardinality) per account and per metric. When this limit is reached, aggregated data is turned off for the rest of the UTC day. For every major limit violation, New Relic creates an NrIntegrationError event for that account, which has these limit-related attributes: Attribute Description category RateLimit or ApiLimit. The RateLimit category is used for limits based on a unit of time such as the number of requests ingested per minute. The ApiLimit is used for constant limits, such as the number of attributes on a record. limitName The name of the limit. message Describes the limit and the impact. limitValue The limit reached. System limits UI The system Limits page (from the account dropdown, click Manage your data and click Limits on the left) displays when your account has encountered a rate limit in the specified time period. The page displays a default period of 24 hours; you can set a custom range from the top-right of the page. Non-limit-related NrIntegrationError events are not displayed here. In addition, this page does not display information about limits you have not hit, or how close you are to reaching a limit.

      "body": "Here are some best practices based on how OpenTelemetry works with New Relic: Resources Batching Compression Traces Metrics Logs Resources A resource in OpenTelemetry represents information about an entity generating telemetry data. All telemetry data sent to New Relic is expected to be associated with a resource so that it can be linked with the appropriate entity in New Relic. The OpenTelemetry Resource SDK specification defines the functionality implemented by all language SDKs for defining a resource. The following suites of attributes are defined by the OpenTelemetry resource semantic conventions. These attributes are usually set by creating a resource using the OpenTelemetry SDK. service.* attributes service.name attribute is required to associate your resource with an entity in the UI service.instance.id is required for certain panes to light up telemetry.sdk.language=java is required to see data in the JVM section Batching Caution Avoid getting rate limited! You should batch requests sent to the OTLP endpoint as described in this section. By default, the OpenTelemetry SDKs and Collector send one (1) data point per request. Using these defaults, it is likely your account will be rate limited. All OpenTelemetry SDKs and Collectors provide a BatchProcessor, which batches data points in memory. This batching allows requests to be sent with more than one (1) data point. Component Batch Processor Collector Batch Processor Go SDK BatchSpanProcessor JS SDK BatchSpanProcessor Python SDK BatchExportSpanProcessor Compression New Relic supports gzip compression for OTLP payloads exported over gRPC. To maximize the amount of data you can send per request, we recommend enabling compression in all OTLP exporters. If there are other compression formats you'd like to see us support, please let us know in the CNCF Slack channel. Traces Familiarize yourself with these trace topics to ensure your traces and spans appear in New Relic. Required fields The startTimeUnixNano and endTimeUnixNano fields on spans are required according to the OpenTelemetry protocol for trace data. When startTimeUnixNano is not present, the span is dropped and a NrIntegrationError is created. When endTimeUnixNano is not present, the duration of your span is large and negative. The timeUnixNano field on span events is required. When timeUnixNano is not present, the span event is dropped and a NrIntegrationError is created. The traceId and spanId fields on spans are required according to the OpenTelemetry protocol for trace data. When traceId or spanId are not present, the span is dropped and a NrIntegrationError is created. Sampling Trace data is the most mature OpenTelemetry data type. Because of this, New Relic's OpenTelemetry user experience is largely based on trace data and is therefore influenced by your sampling strategy. You can configure sampling in a number of places: Service: Use the OpenTelemetry SDK for your language. Collector: If you're running your own instance of the OpenTelemetry collector, you can configure it to do more sophisticated forms of sampling, such as tail-based sampling (see below). Check out this documentation about how to configure different types of sampling: OpenTelemetry built-in samplers Built-in samplers implemented by the OpenTelemetry SDK for each language. OpenTelemetry tail-based samplers The OpenTelemetry collector has a tail-based sampling processor. We have an example demonstrating the use of the tail-based sampling processor. New Relic tail-based sampling with Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing is New Relic's tail-based sampling option. You can use this in conjunction with your OpenTelemetry instrumented services. In setting up Infinite Tracing, you need to override the default span endpoint and send telemetry data to the New Relic trace observer: Important Currently, Infinite Tracing does not support OTLP ingest. You must run your own instance of the OpenTelemetry Collector and configure it to use the New Relic exporter. Follow the steps in Set up the trace observer to get the value for YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL. Use the value of YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL to configure your integration. Since you want New Relic to analyze all your traces, make sure to verify that your OpenTelemetry integrations use the AlwaysOn sampler. Metrics OpenTelemetry metrics are largely compatible with New Relic dimensional metrics. We support OpenTelemetry metrics v0.10. All of the supported metric types include an independent set of associated attributes (name-value pairs) which map directly to dimensions you can use to facet or filter metric data at query time. OpenTelemetry metrics are accompanied by a set of resource attributes that identify the originating entity that produced them and map to dimensions for faceting and filtering. The OpenTelemetry data model for metrics defines a number of different metric types: sum, gauge, histogram, and summary. Sum metrics OpenTelemetry sums are a scalar metric that is the sum of all data points over a given time window. Sums have a notion of temporality indicating whether reported values incorporate previous measurements (cumulative temporality) or not (delta temporality). In addition, sums can either be monotonic (only go up or only go down) or non-monotonic (go up and down). Delta sums In New Relic, delta metrics are handled differently depending on whether they are monotonic or non-monotonic: Monotonic delta sums are mapped to the count metric type. Non-monotonic delta sums are mapped to the gauge metric type. Cumulative sums Monotonic and non-monotonic cumulative sums are mapped to the New Relic gauge metric type. Sum configuration examples To understand how to configure aggregation temporality, see these examples using the Java and Go OpenTelemetry SDKs. Gauge metrics OpenTelemetry gauge metric data points represent a sampled value at a given time. These values are converted to the New Relic gauge metric type. OpenTelemetry gauges do not have an aggregation temporality, but the sampled values can be aggregated at query time. Histogram metrics OpenTelemetry histograms compactly represent a population of recorded values along with a total count and sum. Optionally, histograms may include a series of buckets with explicit bounds and a count value for that bucket’s population. OpenTelemetry histograms are converted to New Relic’s distribution metric type, which is backed by a scaled exponential base 2 histogram (see NrSketch for a more thorough explanation). Counts from OpenTelemetry histogram buckets are assigned to New Relic’s distribution metric buckets using linear interpolation. Also, OpenTelemetry has negative and positive infinity bound buckets which we represent in New Relic as zero-width buckets. We do this because we do not have a representation for negative and positive infinity. For example, an OpenTelemetry bucket with bounds [-∞, 10) will be represented by a [10,10) zero width New Relic bucket. You may see exaggerated bucket counts at the endpoints of your distribution due to this translation. Summary metrics OpenTelemetry summary metric data points are used to represent quantile summaries (for example, P99 latency). These map directly to the New Relic summary metric type. Summary metric data points include count, sum, and quantile values, with 0.0 as min and 1.0 as max. OpenTelemetry provides summary metrics for compatibility with other formats. Start time The startTimeUnixNano field is optional according to the OpenTelemetry specification. When this field is provided, it is used for the timestamp on the resulting NewRelic metric, and the duration is calculated as timeUnixNano - startTimeUnixNano. The duration field is used to calculate the queryable endTimeStamp attribute on the New Relic metric, but it serves no other semantic purpose. If startTimeUnixNano is not provided, then timeUnixNano is used for the timestamp field on the resulting NewRelic metric, and the duration field is set to zero. Array values for attributes OpenTelemetry metrics and other signals may include attributes that consist of a homogenous array of primitive types. These attributes are not supported by New Relic. Exemplars OpenTelemetry defines exemplar values that allow other signals, like traces, to be connected to a metric event and provide context. Exemplars are not supported by New Relic. How to query metrics Consider these tips for building metric NRQL queries in New Relic. Query cumulative sums stored as gauges Since cumulative sums are converted to gauges, here are some ways to query your data: Example: Raw gauge value for cumulative sums To view the raw gauge value for cumulative sums, you can use the latest() NRQL function: SELECT latest(totalApiBytesSent) FROM Metric Copy Example: Rate of change with cumulative sums as gauges To see the rate of change over a given time interval for a cumulative sum stored as a gauge, you can use the derivative() NRQL function: SELECT derivative(totalApiBytesSent, 1 minute) FROM Metric Copy New Relic does not currently support either reporting on resets and gaps or accounting for them with cumulative counters. Query gauge metrics When New Relic converts cumulative sums to gauges, you can query them using either the latest() or derivative() NRQL functions. The function you choose depends on whether you want to see the raw value or compute the rate of change. Query histogram metrics New Relic histograms translated from OpenTelemetry metrics have the same query semantics as other New Relic histograms. Namely, the histogram() NRQL function can be used to represent the histogram with a configurable number of buckets and bucket width. Note that you may see larger bucket counts at the endpoint buckets. This is because we are adding negative and positive infinity bound OpenTelemetry buckets into a zero width New Relic bucket. Example: Normal distribution FROM Metric SELECT histogram(test.histogram, buckets: 100, width: 1000) WHERE distributionType = 'Normal Distribution' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Example: Heat map The FACET keyword is also available to create heat map charts. FROM Metric SELECT histogram(test.histogram, buckets: 100, width: 1000) FACET distributionType SINCE 1 day ago Copy Important The TIMESERIES keyword is not supported for New Relic histograms. Logs Logs generated from your applications and environment are an important piece of telemetry. They may represent application logs, machine generated events, or system logs. OpenTelemetry has defined a log data model for representing log data. You can send logs using OpenTelemetry tooling, correlate them with applications, and view them in New Relic. Send logs to New Relic The OpenTelemetry Collector and OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib repositories contain a number of components for consuming log data. The general pattern is to configure the collector to: Receive logs from any of the log receivers. Some of the receiver options include Filelog Receiver, Fluent Forward Receiver, and Syslog Receiver. Process logs, potentially annotating them with resource information. Some of the processor options include Resource Detection Processor and Resource Processor. Export logs to New Relic via the OTLP exporter. Application log correlation Application logs are more useful if they're correlated with other telemetry data produced by the application. The OpenTelemetry semantic convention for services specifies service.name as a required field. All application metric, trace, and log data sent to New Relic with the same service.name are associated with the same entity. The specifics of how logs get annotated with the service.name resource attribute depends on the application's environment: Applications may produce structured JSON logs, which you can configure to include service.name as another field. You can deploy applications alongside a dedicated Collector Agent instance, which you can configure with a Resource Processor to annotate logs with the service.name attribute. Optionally, additional application trace context (sometimes called execution context) can be propagated to log messages. The setup and availability of this depends on the language and logging framework used by the application. The general strategy is to set up the application to write structured JSON logs and to configure it to extract trace context into specified trace context fields on available log messages. The Logs in Context with Log4j2 example in GitHub demonstrates an end-to-end working example for a simple Java application using Log4j2. View OpenTelemetry logs Here are two ways you can view logs: Look in the New Relic Logs UI. If your logs are correlated with an application, view them in the context of the application. The time field The timeUnixNano field is optional according to the OpenTelemetry specification for log data. When timeUnixNano is not present New Relic will use the time that the data was received for the New Relic log timestamp.",

      "body": "Problem You sent metric data points to the Metric API, and are not seeing what you expect when querying the data. Use the following checklist to determine the root cause: Make sure you are querying the data correctly. Check the HTTP status codes returned by the API. Issues like authorization failures can be diagnosed with HTTP status codes. If you are sending data from a Prometheus server via New Relic's remote_write endpoint, check your Prometheus server logs for errors or non-2xx HTTP responses from the New Relic endpoint. Query your account for NrIntegrationError events. New Relic's ingestion endpoints are asynchronous, meaning the endpoint verifies the payload after it returns the HTTP response. If any issues occur while verifying your payload, then an NrIntegrationError event will be created in your account. New Relic also uses NrIntegrationError events to notify customers when various rate limits have been reached. Solution View error details For an introduction to using the NrIntegrationError event, see NrIntegrationError. Here's an example NRQL for examining issues with Metric API ingest: SELECT count(*) FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' facet category, message limit 100 since 24 hours ago Copy The category indicates the type of error and the message provides more detailed information about the error. If the category is rateLimit, then you should also examine the rateLimitType field for more information on the type of rate limiting. Category rateLimitType Description and solution BadRequest (not set) There is an issue with the JSON payload. These include JSON syntax errors, attribute names, or values that are too long. Check the message field to determine the exact issue. Then review the JSON payload, and update it to ensure it meets the proper semantic guidelines. RateLimit DatapointsPerMinute You are sending too many datapoints per minute. If you get this error, you can either send data less frequently, or request changes to your metric rate limits by contacting your New Relic account representative, or visiting our Support portal. RateLimit UniqueTimeseriesPerDay You have an attribute with a high number of unique values, like containerId or URI. To resolve this error, review any attributes that may be causing the issue and remove them. If desired, you can use a data dropping rule to remove attributes at ingest time. RateLimit UniquePrometheusTimeseries You have Prometheus servers reporting too many unique timeseries via New Relic's remote_write endpoint. Reduce the number of unique timeseries reported by modifying your Prometheus server configuration to reduce the number of targets being scraped, or by using relabel rules in the remote_write section of your server configuration to drop timeseries or highly unique labels. RateLimit RequestsPerMinute Too many requests per minute are being sent. To resolve this, put more datapoints in each request, and send them less frequently. RateLimit ErrorGroupsPerDay You have exceeded your daily error group limit. Incoming error groups will be dropped for the remainder of the day and will continue as normal after UTC midnight. To resolve this, reduce the amount of unique error messages collected by New Relic. Match errors to ingested payloads When an NrIntegrationError event is created as a result of a syntax issue with the HTTP request payload, then the event contains the attributes apiKeyPrefix and requestId. The apiKeyPrefix matches the first 6 characters of the API key used to send the data. The requestId matches the requestId sent in the HTTP response. To view these fields, run this NRQL query: SELECT message, apiKeyPrefix, requestId FROM NrIntegrationError limit 100 Copy To verify a specific requestId, run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError where requestId ='REQUEST_ID' Copy Programmatically retrieve NrIntegrationError events To programmatically retrieve these errors: Ensure you have an Insights query API key (go to insights.newrelic.com > Manage data > API keys). Create an HTTP request as shown below: Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you're using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. curl -H \"Accept: application/json\" -H \"X-Query-Key:YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\" \"https://insights-api.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_HERE/query?nrql=SELECT%20*%20FROM%20NrIntegrationError%20where%20newRelicFeature='Metrics'\" Copy",

      "body": "The New Relic Event API is one way to report custom events to New Relic. The Event API lets you send custom event data to your New Relic account with a POST command. These events are then queryable and chartable using NRQL. Want to try out our Event API? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Related content: Learn about all options for reporting custom events. For details about how event data is retained, see Event data retention. For how to add attributes to existing events, see Add custom attributes. Check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom events with the Event API (aka the Insights API). Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data. Requirements For Event API limits and restricted attributes, see Limits. Ensure outbound connectivity on TCP port 443 is allowed to the CIDR range that matches your region. The preferred configuration method is to use the DNS name insights-collector.newrelic.com or insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net. Basic workflow The Event API is an asynchronous endpoint. This allows you to send a very large volume of POSTS, reliably, with very low response latency. Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, ensure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. To send a custom event to a New Relic account: Get a license key for the account you want to report data to. Before creating custom events or attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Generate JSON for the event by instrumenting your application, querying an API, or some other method. Submit a compressed JSON payload (for example, gzip or deflate) to the HTTPS endpoint using curl in a POST request. Recommendation: Set up NRQL alert conditions to notify you when parsing errors occur. This method will send the events directly into your account, where they will be accessible from any NRQL interface or with the Query API. The Event API limits the size, rate, and characters allowed in custom events. Also, like other events available in NRQL, custom events cannot be updated or deleted after they are created. If you have problems with your custom event, follow the troubleshooting procedures or create a new custom event. Get the license key You'll need a license key. License keys are associated with an account, not a specific user. This means that anyone in the account with access to that key can use it. You can submit multiple event types to the same account with the same license key. However, to help ensure security, we recommend that you use different keys for different applications or data sources. Alternatively, you can use an Insights insert keyfor this API, but we recommend using a license key. Format the JSON The Event API accepts specific formats for attributes included in the payload. Only float or string values are allowed. JSON format guidelines When defining attributes for your custom events, follow these JSON format guidelines. Attributes JSON format guidelines eventType Required: The event's name. Float and string values Float value format: \"label\":value String value format: \"label\":\"value\" Data types The API only accepts key-value pairs, not map/object or array values. Supported data types for this API are strings and numbers (integers or floats). For more information, see Data requirements. Digits in strings For performance-related reasons, we do not cast values submitted to the API. For example, we treat 123 as a number and \"123\" as a string. The database will only store up to 64 bit numbers. Any numbers larger than 64 bits will be truncated. Dates For attributes that contain date information, use an unformatted Unix timestamp in the Insights data formatter. You can define the date attribute either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Time Unless otherwise specified, the timestamp for a submitted event is the time it was submitted to New Relic. To specify a different time for the event, use the timestamp attribute. JSON example Here is an example of a typical JSON data set for sending with the API. This call sends two Purchase type events as a JSON array. You can add multiple events in a single HTTP call using a JSON array. [ { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":3, \"amount\":259.54 }, { \"eventType\":\"Purchase\", \"account\":5, \"amount\":12309, \"product\":\"Item\" } ] Copy When generating the JSON, make sure your attributes are properly formatted. Limits and restricted characters The following size and rate limits apply to events sent via the Event API: Max events per API call: 2K Payload total size: 1MB(10^6 bytes) maximum per POST. We highly recommend using compression. The payload must be encoded as UTF-8. Number of attributes per event: 255 maximum Length of attribute name: 255 characters Length of attribute value: 4096 maximum character length There are rate limits on the number of HTTP requests per minute sent to the Event API. Some specific attributes have additional restrictions: accountId: This is a reserved attribute name. If it is included, it will be dropped during ingest. entity.guid, entity.name, and entity.type: These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis. appId: Value must be an integer. If it is not an integer, the attribute name and value will be dropped during ingest. eventType: Can be a combination of alphanumeric characters, _ underscores, and : colons. timestamp: Must be a Unix epoch timestamp. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds. Submit the custom event Data submitted to the Event API uses a compressed JSON format in a simple HTTPS POST request. This example uses gzip, but you can also use deflate. Linux/bash example gzip -c example_events.json | curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"Api-Key: YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" -H \"Content-Encoding: gzip\" https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/events --data-binary @- Copy Windows/PowerShell example $accountId = \"YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID\" $insertkey = \"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\" # Replace with your custom event for the body $body = '[{\"eventType\": \"powershell\", \"account\": 4, \"amount\": 123, \"fileLocation\": \"c:\\\\temp2\", \"zipped\": \"true\" }]' $headers = @{} $headers.Add(\"Api-Key\", \"$insertkey\") $headers.Add(\"Content-Encoding\", \"gzip\") $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8 $enc_data = $encoding.GetBytes($body) $output = [System.IO.MemoryStream]::new() $gzipStream = New-Object System.IO.Compression.GzipStream $output, ([IO.Compression.CompressionMode]::Compress) $gzipStream.Write($enc_data, 0, $enc_data.Length) $gzipStream.Close() $gzipBody = $output.ToArray() Invoke-WebRequest -Headers $headers -Method Post -Body $gzipBody \"https://insights-collector.newrelic.com/v1/accounts/$accountId/events\" Copy Important Always use compression with every payload. This allows you to send more data, and it saves resources during parsing. Before generating your HTTP request, make sure it is properly formatted, including: The Api-Key contains the correct license key. The Content-Type is application/json. The request uses POST only. The API does not accept PUT and GET requests. The API supports HTTP/1.1 persistent connections. This is helpful to manage client-side performance under heavy event loads. Verify or troubleshoot request response The Event API follows a two-step process to process requests: The Event API synchronously acknowledges or rejects the request based on validation of the headers and payload size. The Event API asynchronously parses the payload after a successful HTTP response is provided to the client. This may generate an error due to missing or malformed data. These are classified as submission errors or parsing errors. All successful submissions receive a 200 response, regardless of any data errors that may exist within the payload. The response includes a uuid, which is a unique ID created for each request. The uuid also appears in any error events created for the request. Other potential issues: 10-second timeout: API calls exceeding 10 seconds will time out. Large payloads: Payloads exceeding 100 KB may see increased response times. Recommendation: In addition to checking for a success message, create a NRQL query of your data to verify it's available. Success response code Success message Comments 200 {\"success\":true,\"uuid\":\"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\"} Copy Submission errors Payloads with submission errors are handled and returned to the sender through an HTTP response code. To troubleshoot payload submission errors, refer to these HTTP response codes. Submission errors Troubleshooting 400 Missing or invalid content length: Unable to process empty request. 403 Missing or invalid key: Invalid license key. Register a valid license key. 408 Request timed out: Request took too long to process. 413 Content too large: Request is too large to process. Refer to the limits and restricted characters to troubleshoot. 415 Invalid content type: Must be application/JSON. The Event API accepts any content type except multi-part/related and assumes it can be parsed to JSON. 429 Too many requests due to rate limiting. 503 Service temporarily unavailable: Retry request Parsing errors Parsing errors occur if: An event is sent within a payload, but it is either missing data or is exceeding maximum limits. New Relic will drop the individual event from the payload, generate an NrIntegrationError event, and process the rest. The JSON payload includes malformed JSON or missing required data. Payloads with parsing errors receive a 200 response to indicate a successful submission. To help resolve parsing errors, a new NrIntegrationError event type is created. All parsing errors are due to NRQL queries. For error messages related to dropped events, New Relic will include the number of events that were dropped as part of the message. To troubleshoot requests with parsing errors, refer to these error messages. Parsing errors Troubleshooting X event(s) rejected because attribute appId was not an integer An appId attribute has a non-integer value, such as a decimal value or string. X event(s) rejected because eventType cannot contain the following characters: [., \\] An eventType attributed included an invalid character, such as a period or backslash. X event(s) rejected because attribute is missing attribute name An attribute name was set to null or an empty string. X event(s) rejected because attribute name exceeded maximum length An attribute name has more than 255 characters. X event(s) rejected because attribute value exceeded maximum length An attribute value was longer than 4096 characters. X event(s) rejected because event exceeded maximum number of attributes An event has more than 255 attributes. X event(s) rejected because missing required attributes eventType The eventType attribute is required for the custom event. Error parsing JSON payload There was an error parsing the request JSON because of formatting problems or corrupted data. Query and alert with NrIntegrationError The NrIntegrationError event allows you to query and set alerts on custom data being sent to your New Relic account. Recommendation: To get alerts for parsing errors, create a NRQL alert condition for NrIntegrationError. Use this example NRQL query: SELECT message FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Event API' AND category = 'EventApiException' Copy NrIntegrationError attributes Troubleshooting timestamp The timestamp when the request was received. The timestamp attribute takes a 64-bit integer Unix timestamp within the last 24 hours. You can define timestamps either in seconds or in milliseconds, both relative to the Unix epoch. Do not use a decimal for the timestamp. If a decimal is used, the attribute will default to the timestamp when the custom event was created. newRelicFeature The name of the feature experiencing errors. For all custom event parsing errors, this will be Event API. apiKeyPrefix The first six characters of the license key used for the request that generated an error. requestId The uuid returned by the the API for the request that generated an error. Category The category of the error. For custom events, this is EventApiException. Message Contents of the error message. Name The error's name. For custom events, this is always EventValidationException. eventTypeSample One of the event types that generated the error, when available. Find your data To find data sent via the Event API (and from integrations that use this API), you can query it. For example, to query a custom event using NRQL, you would run: SELECT * FROM YOUR_CUSTOM_EVENT Copy For more on how to query, see Query data. Limit on HTTP requests The Event API has a rate limit of 100,000 HTTP requests (POSTs) per minute, per account. (Note that this is not a limit on the number of events per minute; only on the number of POSTs per minute.) This limit helps ensure that large traffic spikes in accounts across our multi-tenant platform do not negatively affect how the service performs for you. If your API usage exceeds 100k POSTs in a 1-minute window, we will reject subsequent API requests with a 429 response code for the remainder of the 1-minute window. At the end of the 1-minute window, the counter will be reset and allow traffic to resume. This limit is intended to be an upper threshold that you shouldn't hit under normal scenarios. If you have a high number of 429 responses, consider using the API less. If you are expecting a higher-than-normal activity level in the near future and want to prepare for that, contact technical support.",

Then we count the bytes needed to represent your data in a standard format, like JSON. If you're on our New Relic One pricing plan, you're charged by the number of bytes written to our database, above and beyond the standard amount that’s free. Important This doc is for accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan. If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, see Original data retention. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. The Data ingestion page shows your ingest rates for a period you specify on the top-right of the Data management hub. Since 30 days ago is the default setting, but you can also set a custom date span. The page shows your daily average GBs, and the total for the range you set. You can toggle between an overall ingest view and an account view to identify which of your accounts are sending the most data. The page also provides the current month-to-date, and the projected end-of-month total ingest rates. With this information, you can proactively drop data or turn off agents in order to manage ingest and, therefore, costs. If you want to take a look at how we query the data, click the ellipsis icon (just above the chart) to slide out the chart query and open it in our query builder. And If you want to drill down further into your data usage, check out the sample queries in the usage docs. From the Login drop-down, select Manage your data, and then select Data ingestion. This is the Data ingestion page with data source and account views. Data ingestion sources The Data ingestion page describes which of your data sources provide the most data on average and during specific data ranges. The sources are described here. Billable data sources Description Timeslices (1-minute) and Metric:Raw Metrics are timeslices + MetricRaw Metric group: MetricsBytes Metric timeslice data averages to one-hour periods after eight days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in one-hour periods. We currently store the raw metric data for 30 days. You are only billed for the initial ingest volume. You are not billed for subsequent rollups. APM (transactions and errors) APM events Metric group: ApmEventsBytes InfraSamples:Raw Includes multiple Infrastructure events Infrastructure host data Metric group:InfraHostBytes Information related to your servers and virtual machines coming from infrastructure agents, including storage and network data Infrastructure process data stored in ProcessSample. Metric group: InfraProcessBytes Data are metrics related to each process running on the hosts running the Infrastructure agent. This feature is turned off by default. Infrastructure integrations Metric group: InfraIntegrationBytes Performance data related to applications and services, typically managed by the customer, including data related to Docker containers, Windows services, Nagios checks, and cloud integrations such as managed services in AWS, Azure, and GCP. Logging Includes logs and any Log_<value> custom data partition created Metric group: LoggingBytes Log records are stored into the Log event type by default. Additional custom data partitions will create new event types, which are always prefixed with Log_ and will be counted as part of the overall set of log data stored. With LogExtendedRecord, log messages longer than 4KB are split into multiple events that, when needed, are stitched together to display the original message; this reduces the size of message data. As of September 2021, log storage as blobs replaces LogExtendedRecord. With blob storage, NRDB can store up to 128,000 bytes for any attribute, not just messages. For more information, see our blobs documentation for logs. Default Custom events Metric group: CustomEventsBytes Mobile error Mobile general Breadcrumb crash event trails Mobile session Mobile exception Mobile crash Mobile events Metric group: MobileEventsBytes Tracing Metric group: TracingBytes TracingBytes includes Span and OpenTelemetry's SpanEvent. You are not charged for DistributedTraceSummary events. Browser:EventLog Browser Browser:JSErrors PcvPerf (PageView timing) Browser events Metric group: BrowserEventsBytes Lambda Serverless Metric group: ServerlessBytes Break down data to see what's contributing to your ingest You can inspect your data ingest to gain more information about your ingest health. This way, you'll know your baselines, and can more easily spot an anomaly like an ingest spike, as well as its source. To break down your ingested data, start from the chart on the Data ingestion page. Think of the data source bands as the Y axis, and the dates as the X axis. Click on the band you want to inspect at the spot in the X axis that corresponds with the date you want to investigate. This image shows the Metrics band for June 15 right before it's clicked. A modal opens with the account, data source, and facet selected. You can do a handful of things on this page: Change the account, data source, or facet you want to drill down into. Change the date and time to investigate. Review the results of the query in chart form. The chart displays the top 15 results for the facet query. Open the NRQL query in the Query builder where you'll find additional facets that you can use. Learn more about NRQL queries here. How we break your ingest data down Some of the content in the UI is variable, depending on your account. This information is intended to help you understand how we're working with your ingest data. The chart on the Data ingestion page shows data usage for a little longer time frame than that covered by your retention settings for each data ingest source. If you choose a date outside of your designated retention period for an ingest source, you'll get the message that there's no chart data available. Select a more recent date to fix this problem. If you inspect a data source for an account that has less than a terrabyte of data, we compute the ingest volume over a 24 hour period; otherwise, we compute it for a 1 hour period. The ingest value provided on the main Data ingestion chart will be slightly different from that reflected during inspection. This is because our facet computation is an estimate. Set alerts for data use Query and alert on usage data describes how to set alerts to get notified if you're nearing data ingest limits you don't want to cross. For example, you might set an alert on logs, which can stack up quickly in an active system. Adjust your data ingest Drop data for lower retention costs and data compliance On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. Learn how to set additional data dropping rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules. Turn off agents and integrations If you don’t need data from specific agents or integrations that you have installed, you can uninstall/delete those tools. For instructions, see the specific documentation for an agent or integration.",

Metric types The metric type determines how the data is aggregated over longer time windows. It also determines which functions you can use to query the data. Metric types Description Available query functions count Measures the number of occurrences of an event. The count should be reset to 0 every time the metric is reported. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. You must specify a value for interval.ms when reporting the count metric type using the Metric API. The value must be a positive double. Generally, you want to take the rate of the sum: From Metric select rate(sum(myMetric), 1 minute) . . . sum distribution Tracks the statistical distribution on a numeric attribute. This metric is re-aggregatable. For example, 1-minute data points from 60 minutes can be aggregated into a 1-hour data point, without degradation on accuracy. This type: Supports statistical functions like percentile and histogram, and all functions supported by the summary type. Uses the same algorithm as the percentile function. percentile histogram min max sum count average gauge Represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include the temperature, CPU usage, and memory. For example, there is always a temperature, but you are periodically taking the temperature and reporting it. The value must fit into the range of a Java double. latest min max sum count average summary Used to report pre-aggregated data, or information on aggregated discrete events. A summary includes a count, sum value, min value, and max value. The count value must be positive. Examples include transaction count/durations and queue count/ durations.

      "body": "To ensure our systems are always up and ready to support you, and to keep you from unintended use, we place limits on the amount of data you can send, query, and store. Responses to limit violations Limits are enforced per child account, and across our APIs. You might reach a limit if you start monitoring a new high-traffic application, or have a sudden data spike. When you do reach a limit, New Relic responds according to the type of data and the limit that’s reached. For example: We place a limit on the number of ingested requests per minute (RPM) per data type. When this limit is reached, we stop accepting data and return a 429 status code for the duration of the minute. For queries, we place limits on the number of queries per minute and the number of records inspected (see query limits). When the number of queries per minute limit is reached, New Relic will begin rejecting queries until the number of queries is below the limit. When the records inspected limit is reached, New Relic will reject traffic from the source scanning the largest number of records and attempt to allow traffic from other sources. For metrics, we place a limit on the number of unique timeseries (cardinality) per account and per metric. When this limit is reached, aggregated data is turned off for the rest of the UTC day. For every major limit violation, New Relic creates an NrIntegrationError event for that account, which has these limit-related attributes: Attribute Description category RateLimit or ApiLimit. The RateLimit category is used for limits based on a unit of time such as the number of requests ingested per minute. The ApiLimit is used for constant limits, such as the number of attributes on a record. limitName The name of the limit. message Describes the limit and the impact. limitValue The limit reached. System limits UI The system Limits page (from the account dropdown, click Manage your data and click Limits on the left) displays when your account has encountered a rate limit in the specified time period.

See Overview of pricing and user model. The Data ingestion page shows your ingest rates for a period you specify on the top-right of the Data management hub. Since 30 days ago is the default setting, but you can also set a custom date span. The page shows your daily average GBs, and the total for the range you set. You can toggle between an overall ingest view and an account view to identify which of your accounts are sending the most data. The page also provides the current month-to-date, and the projected end-of-month total ingest rates. With this information, you can proactively drop data or turn off agents in order to manage ingest and, therefore, costs. If you want to take a look at how we query the data, click the ellipsis icon (just above the chart) to slide out the chart query and open it in our query builder. And If you want to drill down further into your data usage, check out the sample queries in the usage docs. From the Login drop-down, select Manage your data, and then select Data ingestion. This is the Data ingestion page with data source and account views. Data ingestion sources The Data ingestion page describes which of your data sources provide the most data on average and during specific data ranges. The sources are described here. Billable data sources Description Timeslices (1-minute) and Metric:Raw Metrics are timeslices + MetricRaw Metric group: MetricsBytes Metric timeslice data averages to one-hour periods after eight days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in one-hour periods. We currently store the raw metric data for 30 days. You are only billed for the initial ingest volume. You are not billed for subsequent rollups. APM (transactions and errors) APM events Metric group: ApmEventsBytes InfraSamples:Raw Includes multiple Infrastructure events Infrastructure host data Metric group:InfraHostBytes Information related to your servers and virtual machines coming from infrastructure agents, including storage and network data Infrastructure process data stored in ProcessSample. Metric group: InfraProcessBytes Data are metrics related to each process running on the hosts running the Infrastructure agent. This feature is turned off by default. Infrastructure integrations Metric group: InfraIntegrationBytes Performance data related to applications and services, typically managed by the customer, including data related to Docker containers, Windows services, Nagios checks, and cloud integrations such as managed services in AWS, Azure, and GCP. Logging Includes logs and any Log_<value> custom data partition created Metric group: LoggingBytes Log records are stored into the Log event type by default. Additional custom data partitions will create new event types, which are always prefixed with Log_ and will be counted as part of the overall set of log data stored. With LogExtendedRecord, log messages longer than 4KB are split into multiple events that, when needed, are stitched together to display the original message; this reduces the size of message data. As of September 2021, log storage as blobs replaces LogExtendedRecord. With blob storage, NRDB can store up to 128,000 bytes for any attribute, not just messages. For more information, see our blobs documentation for logs. Default Custom events Metric group: CustomEventsBytes Mobile error Mobile general Breadcrumb crash event trails Mobile session Mobile exception Mobile crash Mobile events Metric group: MobileEventsBytes Tracing Metric group: TracingBytes TracingBytes includes Span and OpenTelemetry's SpanEvent. You are not charged for DistributedTraceSummary events. Browser:EventLog Browser Browser:JSErrors PcvPerf (PageView timing) Browser events Metric group: BrowserEventsBytes Lambda Serverless Metric group: ServerlessBytes Break down data to see what's contributing to your ingest You can inspect your data ingest to gain more information about your ingest health. This way, you'll know your baselines, and can more easily spot an anomaly like an ingest spike, as well as its source. To break down your ingested data, start from the chart on the Data ingestion page. Think of the data source bands as the Y axis, and the dates as the X axis. Click on the band you want to inspect at the spot in the X axis that corresponds with the date you want to investigate. This image shows the Metrics band for June 15 right before it's clicked. A modal opens with the account, data source, and facet selected. You can do a handful of things on this page: Change the account, data source, or facet you want to drill down into. Change the date and time to investigate. Review the results of the query in chart form. The chart displays the top 15 results for the facet query. Open the NRQL query in the Query builder where you'll find additional facets that you can use. Learn more about NRQL queries here. How we break your ingest data down Some of the content in the UI is variable, depending on your account. This information is intended to help you understand how we're working with your ingest data. The chart on the Data ingestion page shows data usage for a little longer time frame than that covered by your retention settings for each data ingest source. If you choose a date outside of your designated retention period for an ingest source, you'll get the message that there's no chart data available. Select a more recent date to fix this problem. If you inspect a data source for an account that has less than a terrabyte of data, we compute the ingest volume over a 24 hour period; otherwise, we compute it for a 1 hour period. The ingest value provided on the main Data ingestion chart will be slightly different from that reflected during inspection. This is because our facet computation is an estimate. Set alerts for data use Query and alert on usage data describes how to set alerts to get notified if you're nearing data ingest limits you don't want to cross. For example, you might set an alert on logs, which can stack up quickly in an active system. Adjust your data ingest Drop data for lower retention costs and data compliance On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. Learn how to set additional data dropping rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules. Turn off agents and integrations If you don’t need data from specific agents or integrations that you have installed, you can uninstall/delete those tools. For instructions, see the specific documentation for an agent or integration.",

This document describes the structure of our dimensional metric data, aka the Metric data type. To learn about how to query this type of data, see Query metrics. Metric types The metric type determines how the data is aggregated over longer time windows. It also determines which functions you can use to query the data. Metric types Description Available query functions count Measures the number of occurrences of an event. The count should be reset to 0 every time the metric is reported. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. You must specify a value for interval.ms when reporting the count metric type using the Metric API. The value must be a positive double. Generally, you want to take the rate of the sum: From Metric select rate(sum(myMetric), 1 minute) . . . sum distribution Tracks the statistical distribution on a numeric attribute. This metric is re-aggregatable. For example, 1-minute data points from 60 minutes can be aggregated into a 1-hour data point, without degradation on accuracy. This type: Supports statistical functions like percentile and histogram, and all functions supported by the summary type. Uses the same algorithm as the percentile function. percentile histogram min max sum count average gauge Represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include the temperature, CPU usage, and memory. For example, there is always a temperature, but you are periodically taking the temperature and reporting it. The value must fit into the range of a Java double. latest min max sum count average summary Used to report pre-aggregated data, or information on aggregated discrete events. A summary includes a count, sum value, min value, and max value. The count value must be positive. Examples include transaction count/durations and queue count/ durations. You must specify a value for interval.ms when reporting the summary metric type using the Metric API. min max sum count average uniqueCount Tracks the number of unique values on a string or numeric attribute. This metric is re-aggregatable. For example, 1-minute data points from 60 minutes can be aggregated into a 1-hour data point, without degradation on accuracy.

      "body": "At New Relic, we're super proud of NRDB, the New Relic database where we store your data. It gathers all your telemetry data in one place, gives you a connected view of all your data, and scales as your business grows. We invite you to send all your metrics, events, logs, and traces to NRDB, including those from third-party sources. We also recognize that some data might not be necessary for your business goals. You shouldn’t have to wade through data you don’t need to get to the data you do. And you definitely shouldn’t have to pay for it. That’s where our data management tools come in: they let you decide what data you send to New Relic and how long it should be stored. Data management hub: from the user profile drop down, select Manage your data. Coupled with user management tools, data management helps you get maximum value from your investment in New Relic, all while safeguarding your data. Important Not yet a New Relic customer? Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Where to find the Data management hub To locate the data management UI: From one.newrelic.com select the account dropdown, and select Manage your data. If you're on the New Relic One user model, you can also find the Data management hub by selecting Administration > Manage data. Better cost, performance, and compliance Collecting and storing data in New Relic allows you to analyze, visualize, and alert on all your metrics, events, logs, and traces from across all of your sources. However, it’s important to manage that data for cost, performance, and in some cases, compliance reasons. The data management hub provides the tools you need to understand and control where your data is coming from, and adjust what’s stored and for how long. Important If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, you'll see your data ingest, retention, and limits in the Data management hub. The primary difference is that you're not billed on ingest, as with our New Relic One pricing plan. Not sure which plan you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. Cost management The cost of data storage continually decreases, but storage is still an expense. The amount of data you process and store is closely related to the value you receive from New Relic, because it’s a key component of how you’re charged. Our ingest process helps you hone your data. For example, data might arrive at our processing front door compressed and of varying quality. Through ingest, that data is uncompressed, decorated with queryable attributes, and evaluated. Elements are dropped or trimmed, all before we write it to NRDB. That way, the data you store is only the data you want most. Performance management While NRDB is a phenomenally scalable database, it’s also a reality that queries across huge datasets might not return results in a timely enough fashion for your needs. You get better performance if you limit the data we store, or convert it into a format that keeps it easily queryable. Drop data to improve performance by reducing the amount of data that’s stored. Ingest and retention strategies Depending on your goals, whether to reduce costs, increase specific retention rates, or pare down your data to what’s most essential, we have a strategy for you. Learn about reducing the amount of data that comes into NRDB in Manage data coming into New Relic. Learn about customizing storage so you only store the data you want, for the period you want in Manage data stored in New Relic. Learn about dropping data in Drop data using NerdGraph.

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

These metrics include duration information for the monitor, location of the monitor check, size of the request and response headers, the type of monitor, and a timestamp. Each time a synthetic monitor runs a check, details about the check are captured in theSyntheticCheck event type. SyntheticCheck events contain details specific to the check to provide visibility such as the status, type of monitor, and size of request and response headers. SyntheticRequest SyntheticRequest returns results from individual HTTP requests made during a check. The data gathered include job information, location, type of content for request, duration information, request size, and page load information. With each simple or scripted monitor check, we capture each individual HTTP request made during the check. The HTTP details are captured at a more granular level than the SyntheticCheck event type. SyntheticPrivateLocationStatus Every monitor check running on a private location triggers capacity details for that private location. These details are captured in a SyntheticPrivateLocationStatus event. This provides visibility into the capacity of a private location and whether additional minions are required to support the workload. SyntheticPrivateMinion If you have private locations, such as those inside your firewall, you can view information regarding those locations with the SyntheticPrivateMinion event.

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words.

      "body": "New Relic's APM Errors page helps you identify, triage, and fix errors in your services. The Errors page uses data collected by the APM agent to display stack traces, transaction attributes such as HTTP header values, and any other custom attributes, so you can understand the context of the error and fix it. Error data types: events and trace details By default, our APM agents collect two type of error data: Events Trace details Events The error event data type includes default attributes, as well as any custom attributes instrumented in your service. It doesn't include a stack trace. Find your events data in the Errors UI as follows: The Errors column in the Error traces table. The Top 5 errors chart. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors not displaying a stack trace are based on this type of data. You can disable Show only errors with stack trace to show errors that have this type of data collected, but no associated trace details. Events are subject to sampling (see Caps on error reporting and Charting error rates and counts). For more on error event data, see Events reported by APM. Trace details The trace details error data type includes stack traces and attributes, and supplements events with more data. It's expected that more events will be reported than trace details--see Caps on error reporting. Find your trace details data in the Errors UI as follows: The “Stack traces” column of the Error traces table. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors with a stack trace use this type of data: Show only errors with stack trace is enabled by default, to constrain the errors shown to just those that have this type of data collected. This data is governed by specific retention rules for Error details. Caps on error reporting New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute per agent instance 20 trace details per minute per agent instance These caps prevent error reporting from negatively impacting application performance. Examples: App running across five EC2 instances, one JVM each. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 5 instances = 500 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 5 instances = 100 trace details per minute App running on one host with ten instances. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 10 instances = 1000 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 10 instances = 200 events per minute Charting error rates and counts The Error rate chart is driven by a query on metric timeslice data, which is an unsampled aggregate data type that is accurate but has very limited dimensionality. This data can't be faceted or filtered as flexibly as error event data. You can reproduce this chart in a dashboard, or explore the metric timeslice data further by clicking the ... menu on the Error rate chart, and then using the View query or Add to dashboard options. To chart faceted error counts using event data, as in the Top 5 errors chart, use an NRQL event query. Click the ... menu on the Top 5 errors chart and choose View query for a starting point in creating your chart. Since event data can be sampled (see Caps on error reporting), you can use the EXTRAPOLATE keyword to get an accurate error count, even if sampling is occurring. Report custom errors You can report errors not collected by default with our agents using our agent APIs. For more, see the documentation on the API. Ignore errors You can prevent certain errors that would normally be reported to New Relic from being collected using our agent APIs or the server-side configuration UI. For more details, see Manage errors in APM. Reduce noise with expected errors Sometimes you want to collect error data, but not have those errors wake you up through alerts. Using the agent API, you can mark such errors as “expected”. They’ll still be visible in the Errors page, but won’t affect your service’s error rate or Apdex metrics. Disable error traces To prevent certain errors from being reported to New Relic, disable them in your agent's configuration file. For most agents, you can ignore certain error codes or disable errors completely. For more information, see your specific agent's configuration documentation: C SDK Go (not applicable; the agent only reports errors when configured to do so) Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Delete error traces Caution You cannot recover error traces after you delete them. Deleting errors is currently only available in the legacy Errors Classic UI. If you want to... Do this... Delete all error traces for your app If you have permissions to delete all error traces for an app: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > More views > Errors (classic). Select Delete all errors. Delete all error traces for your account To delete all error traces for your New Relic account, get support at support.newrelic.com. Delete individual error traces To delete individual error traces, use APM's Errors (classic) page. Drill into an error from the table of errors, then click Delete this error. In addition to deleting error traces, you may also want to delete transaction traces or database/slow SQL traces. This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).",

      "body": "The thread profiler is a low-impact profiling tool that can be used in production to identify bottlenecks in an application. It works by periodically (100ms) capturing the stack trace of each thread for a specified duration. At the end of the specified duration, the stack traces are aggregated to build a tree. The call count in the tree corresponds to the number of times that function was present in the stack traces under the same context. Although the call tree cannot capture the entire execution, a large enough sample can be a good representation of the application behavior. This provides insights into the \"hot\" functions of the app where most of the time is spent. With this scope, entries sampled less than 0.05% are omitted. Supported agents This feature is available only for specific agents and versions: Java: Agent versions 1.2.004.6 or higher .NET: Framework: Agent versions 2.12.146.0 or higher .NET Core 2.0: Agent versions 8.3.360.0 or higher (Windows only) Linux: .NET Core 3.0 or higher and agent versions 8.23 or higher Python: Agent versions 1.7.0 or higher Ruby: Agent versions 3.5.5 or higher Start the profiler The thread profiler feature is enabled by default. You also may be able to turn it on or off in your agent configuration file: Java: thread_profiler.enabled NET: You cannot disable the thread profiler with .NET apps. Python: thread_profiler.enabled Ruby: thread_profiler.enabled When enabled, you can view the thread profiler from our user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Thread profiler. Select the host you want to run the profiler on. Set the duration for the profiling session. Select Start profiler. This triggers the agent to start the thread profiler during the next harvest cycle (every one minute) and capture data for the specified duration. We record thread backtraces whether or not they are in a runnable state at the time the sample is taken. Threads that are sleeping or blocked on IO may appear in the call tree. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Thread profiler: Use this page to define the settings for the thread profiler duration and to view the results. View profile data After the profiler finishes running, the agent will report the profile data. The call tree automatically appears on the Thread profiler page. The percentages in the call tree represent the percentage of thread backtrace samples in which each call path appeared during the profiling session. The data collection started at the PROFILE COLLECTED time. The page color-codes the tree results: Red: Percentages greater than 30% Yellow: Percentages greater than 10% Black: Percentages less than 10% If you want to... Do this... Change how the thread profile information appears Select your choices of available options in the Tree settings, and select Refresh tree. Change how much information appears Select the Expand or Collapse options above the call tree, or select the name or arrow on any line in the call tree. View summary information about any line in the call tree Mouse over the line. Email the thread profile results to others Select Share this profile. Start another session or view a different thread profile Select Back to all profiles. Agent considerations Depending on which agent you use, the thread profiling feature has additional considerations. .NET-specific notes When using thread profiling with the .NET Framework agent, be aware of the following. .NET agent Thread profiler notes Supported on Linux Thread profiling on Linux is supported on .NET Core 3.0 or later applications when running .NET agent version 8.23 or later. Managed threads only For .NET agents, the thread profiler only captures stack traces on managed threads. It does not capture stack traces on unmanaged threads. If a call to an unmanaged function occurs on a managed thread, the thread profiler will show Native:Function Call in the call tree. No line numbers A .NET thread profile does not include line numbers in the call tree. The Show line numbers checkbox in the Tree Settings does not have any effect. Bug with 64-bit v4.0 .NET CLR There is a bug in the 64-bit version 4.0 .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) that interferes with the agent's ability to retrieve managed stack traces. If your app experiences this bug, APM will show empty thread profiles. This bug does not affect 32-bit applications. The bug is fixed in the CLR releases for .NET 4.5. To verify whether your 64-bit application has the fixed version, look at the full version of the mscorlib.dll in the C: \\ Windows \\ Microsoft.NET \\ Framework64 \\ v4.0.30319 directory. The fix is in versions 4.0.30319.17379 or higher. Other category only All threads are put in the Other category. The Web Request and Background categories are not supported. Python-specific notes When using thread profiling with the Python agent, be aware of the following. Python agent Thread profiler notes Co-routine based systems There are limits to capturing details when a co-routine based system is being used, such as gevent or eventlet modes of gunicorn. If creating a new thread, the Python agent will actually create a greenlet instead of a thread profiler background thread. Therefore, the thread profiler will not capture any web request and background transactions on the thread profiler page. Greenlets A greenlet can run only when other greenlets explicitly yield control, such as when they block. For example, if the thread sampler does get to run, it will only sample the stack for other greenlets at a point where they are blocked. It will not sample them when they are executing arbitrary code. It can completely miss execution within a greenlet if it never blocked or otherwise yielded to another greenlet. Time in Python code Time spent in pure Python code that isn't blocking requests will not be picked up, and no information will be recorded or reported. This is because results are misleading when co-routines are used. Ruby-specific notes When using thread profiling with the Ruby agent, be aware of the following. Ruby agent Thread profiler notes Backtraces The thread profiler depends on the ability to capture thread backtraces from within your Ruby application. For this reason, it requires MRI 1.9.2 or higher (for the Thread#backtrace method). Resque The Ruby agent does not currently support thread profiles with Resque background jobs. A thread profiling session initiated against Resque will only capture traces from the parent process, not the job processes. JRuby JRuby support is considered experimental at this time. There are known issues with JRuby's Thread#backtrace implementation that will affect the accuracy of and reliability of backtraces collected under JRuby.",

Requirements Agent version nr-593 or higher. Description Adds a user-defined attribute name and value to subsequent events on the page. Make this call before the window load event fires (when that data is transmitted) in order for the attributes to be included in the PageView event. Once an attribute is set, New Relic One records it with all PageAction events until the page is reloaded or the attribute is manually unset. If you are using SPA monitoring with a compatible agent version, attributes set with this call will also be included in newrelic.interaction events. However, attributes set using the SPA API will take precedence over these attributes. Errors for custom attributes will be included in events on the JS Errors page. To view or log errors for a custom attribute via API, use the browser API's noticeError call. Parameters Parameter Description $name string Required. Name of the attribute. Appears as column in the PageView event. It will also appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. $value string OR integer Required. Value of the attribute. Appears as the value in the named attribute column in the PageView event. It will appear as a column in the PageAction event if you are using it. Custom attribute values cannot be complex objects, only simple types such as Strings and Integers. Avoid using reserved NRQL words when you name the attribute/value. Examples Get JavaScript/jQuery for HTML elements This example uses JavaScript/jQuery to get the values of the following HTML elements on a Drupal-generated page: <link rel=\"shortlink\" href=\"/node/1111\" /> <h1>Using NRQL</h1> New Relic reports them as custom attributes.

      "body": "Browser monitoring includes strict security measures to provide a robust, standalone product with browser monitoring features. Before you install the browser agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Want to try out our browser monitoring? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Basic requirements To report data to browser, your application must at a minimum meet two basic requirements: The traffic to the application must be from clients able to load and execute browser JavaScript code and set cookies. Clients accessing the application must be able to send data to New Relic through HTTP requests. HTTPS is required for browser Pro features. Important Browsers that subscribe to a disconnect list or that use content filtering extensions such as AdBlock may not be able to send data to New Relic. For example, if you are using the Enhanced Tracking Prevention disconnect list for Mozilla Firefox 69.0 or higher, you will need to change the default configuration. Most typical browser applications meet these requirements. However, browser applications in restricted environments may have difficulty reporting data to New Relic; for example: Hybrid mobile applications Applications installed on unusual hardware, such as point-of-sale terminals or consumer appliances For more information, review the instrumentation for browser monitoring documentation, and verify end-user network access. Browser types Instrumentation is compatible with every browser type, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Edge, and Apple Safari. The user interface is compatible with New Relic's supported browser versions. Exceptions Comments Paint timings The firstPaint and firstContentfulPaint attributes in BrowserInteraction, PageView, and PageViewTiming events are only compatible with: Chrome 60 or higher for desktop and mobile (Android webview and Chrome for Android) Opera 47 or higher for desktop Opera 44 or higher for Android mobile Samsung Internet for mobile AJAX AJAX timing features are not available with: Chrome for iPhone and iPad IE 7 and 8 PageAction events PageAction events require a browser that fully supports cross-domain XMLHttpRequests. Internet Explorer versions 9 and lower cannot record PageAction events. Learn more on querying your data. Session traces Session traces are reported only from browsers that support the Resource Timing Specification. SHA-256 New Relic can only monitor browsers that are compatible with SHA-256. APM agents You can deploy the browser agent for apps monitored by APM, or you can deploy the browser agent for your standalone apps. For more information, see the installation procedures. If you are deploying browser for an app using APM, make sure your agent supports browser monitoring: C SDK: Version 1.0.0 or higher Go: Version 2.5.0 or higher Java: Version 3.4.0 or higher .NET: Version 2.20.25.0 or higher Node.js: Version 1.4.0 or higher PHP: Version 4.4.5.35 or higher Python: Version 2.10.1.9 or higher Ruby: Version 3.7.0.177 or higher Supported frameworks The browser agent collects data on all front-end frameworks. However, the monitoring occurs on lower-level \"primitives\" that JavaScript frameworks use, so the level of detail collected by the instrumentation may vary depending on your specific framework. Exceptions Comments Zone.js If you're using AngularJS and you want to use our SPA monitoring features, note that Zone.js versions 0.6.18 to 0.6.24 are not compatible with browser. In all cases, the browser agent must be loaded before Zone.js to avoid errors. Cypress.io Browser is unable to properly instrument the open and send methods of requests when tests are run in Cypress. This will cause the following error to be thrown: Cannot set property 'status' of undefined Copy This will only affect customers running tests with the Browser agent present in their code. Production applications should not be affected. html2pdf.js This library is not compatible with our Pro+SPA agent due to the way this library wraps promises. If you're using this library, we recommend selecting the Pro agent type. Content Security Policy (CSP) considerations In order to obtain accurate browser performance metrics, browser requires the use of a small, inline JavaScript snippet. New Relic carefully reviews the inline JavaScript to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other potential vulnerabilities. Content Security Policy Level 2 adds restrictions to the types of JavaScript allowed, such as inline scripts. It also limits which domains can load scripts during page load. Important If your website does not allow any third-party hosted JavaScript to run, you must request a CSP exception via your organization’s standard procedures in order to install the browser monitoring agent. When requesting a CSP exception, follow your organization's standard procedures to contact your web or security team. The browser JavaScript agent requires the following CSP exceptions in order to run properly. Alternatively, you can add all of these exceptions to the fallback default-src directive (instead of script-src and connect-src). CSP exception Comments unsafe-inline Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is required because the agent is installed by including an inline script. https://js-agent.newrelic.com Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where additional script files that the agent requires are hosted. https://bam.nr-data.net https://bam-cell.nr-data.net Important Add https://gov-bam.nr-data.net if you're using FedRAMP-compliant endpoints. Add to the script-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. This is where the agent sends its collected data. One of the calls to this URL is a JSONP call, which means that the URL must be allowed as a script source. Add to the connect-src directive or to the fallback default-src directive. The connect-src directive affects the URLs that scripts can call (for example, using the XMLHttpRequest interface). If you have CSP restrictions specifically around this directive, then add this URL as an exception.",

      "body": "Your app's dSYM files are stored in Xcode's dSYM archive path folder. This is the folder where the iOS agent gets the dSYM files that are used to symbolicate your crash reports. New Relic provides a post-build script as part of the iOS agent's install process and the tvOS agent's install process. This script automatically uploads your app's dSYM files. Automatic script The script automatically uploads dSYM files only for release builds. Non-release builds must upload their files either manually or through the mobile monitoring UI. Bitcode-enabled apps have their dSYM files generated by Apple. You must download the dSYM files for Bitcode-enabled apps from Apple and upload them to New Relic. If you see unreadable machine code in the Crashes page, your dSYM files may not be uploaded correctly. In some cases, you may need to manually upload dSYM files. The automatic script uses Python 2. As of October 2019 with macOS 10.15 (Catalina), Python won't be installed by default. If you're using the automatic script (recommended), you may need to manually install Python 2. If you're using Homebrew, see Python on Homebrew. Identify missing dSYMs When a Bitcode-enabled app is uploaded to Apple for App Store review or ad-hoc distribution, dSYMs need to be manually downloaded from Apple and uploaded to New Relic to allow the mobile crash reports to be properly symbolicated. These dSYMs can be downloaded through the archives organizer in Xcode within several minutes of uploading the app. In this situation follow the procedures to find the archive and download dSYMs. If an app is missing a dSYM file, you'll see three indicators in the mobile monitoring UI: Banner notification: A banner warning appears on the Crash report page. The warning reads: We were unable to locate your dsym. Copy Upload prompt: From the Crash type summary page you will be automatically prompted to upload a dSYM file if it is missing. Machine code: The crash stack trace on the Crash report page displays machine code and not a human-readable error message. Upload dSYM files through the mobile monitoring UI You can easily upload your dSYM files directly from the New Relic One UI. The maximum file size is 600 MB. To upload your dSYM files: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. Then select your app from the list. View Crash analysis. Select a specific crash from the Crash types list. Click Upload dSYM. You can either drag and drop your dSYMs directly, or select the file form your computer. Manually upload dSYM files In some circumstances, New Relic's automatic upload of dSYM files may fail. If a dSYM upload is attempted and fails, it creates a build error with a detailed message. For example, if there's a network failure and the dSYM upload isn't completed, Xcode will report an error. For additional information about how New Relic handles dSYM uploads, see New Relic's Online Technical Community. If the automatic upload fails, you can manually upload your dSYM file. If you have multiple dSYM files, they can be within a single zip with a maximum file size of 600 MB. The YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN value in the commands below is the same key used for +[NewRelic startWithApplicationToken:] (in Objective-C) or NewRelic.start(withApplicationToken:) (in Swift). To manually upload your dSYM files: Via Python script (agent versions 6.0.0 or higher) In iOS agent versions 6.0.0 or higher, the agent includes a Python script that automatically processes and uploads symbols. You can call this script from the command line: NewRelicAgent.framework/Resources/generateMap.py \"DSYM_ARCHIVE_PATH\" \"YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" Copy Via command line To manually upload individual dSYM files from the command line: Zip up your dSYM file or files using the following command. Replace ~ /ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH with your new dSYM archive path and file name (for example, Users/my-name/desktop). Also replace ~ /dSYM_PATH with your existing dSYM file path. /usr/bin/zip --recurse-paths --quiet \"~/ZIPPED_DSYM_PATH\" \"~/dSYM_PATH\" Copy Upload the dSYM zip file using the following command: For US accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.newrelic.com/symbol Copy For EU accounts: curl -F dsym=@\"~/DSYM_ZIP_PATH\" -H \"X-APP-LICENSE-KEY: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_APPLICATION_TOKEN\" https://mobile-symbol-upload.eu01.nr-data.net/symbol Copy Troubleshooting Auto-upload failure If a dSYM auto-upload failed, the Report Navigator may have a fully formed cURL command. You can use this cURL command to reattempt an upload. Depending on the error, you may also need to follow some of the dSYM manual upload steps. Here is an example of a successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator: Example: A successful dSYM upload in the Report Navigator. Missing dSYMs If dSYM files are missing, you may need to check Xcode build settings to ensure the file is being generated. Frameworks which are built locally have separate build settings and may need to be updated as well.

      "body": "If you have APM, you can report custom event data. You can then query and visualize your data in New Relic. Data considerations New Relic agents send event data to New Relic as part of the normal harvest cycle every five seconds for agent versions supporting real time streaming. Sending a lot of events can increase the memory overhead of the agent. New Relic enforces an upper limit of 833 custom events every 5 seconds. Additionally, posts greater than 1MB (10^6 bytes) in size will not be recorded, regardless of the custom event limit. You can also send custom events using the Event API (without need for APM). However, be aware that custom events sent with the agent APIs are not compatible with high security mode. Tip For more information, check out New Relic University’s tutorial Adding custom data with the APM agent API. Or, go directly to the full online course Custom data with APM. Record custom events and attributes You can add your own custom APM events and attributes, which you can then use for querying and charting. This is one of several ways to report custom data. To record a custom event, follow the procedures for your New Relic language agent. To add custom attributes to APM events, you must first enable them for your APM agent, and then make an API call to record the attribute. Follow the agent-specific custom attribute procedures. When creating your own custom events and attributes, follow data requirements for: Size limits Attribute types Reserved words C SDK To add a custom event to apps monitored by the C SDK, start a transaction and use the newrelic_create_custom_event and newrelic_record_custom_event functions. For more information, see the Guide to using the C SDK API. You can then add custom attributes for your C SDK app. Go To add a custom event to apps monitored by the Go agent, use RecordCustomEvent. You can then add custom attributes for your Go app. Java Custom event collection is enabled by default in Java agent version 3.13.0 or higher. To send custom events, call recordCustomEvent. For example: Map<String, Object> eventAttributes = new HashMap<String, Object>(); NewRelic.getAgent().getInsights().recordCustomEvent(\"MyCustomEvent\", eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a map with the attributes for your custom event. Event attributes must be strings or numbers. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Java agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to send less than the default of 10000 events: custom_insights_events: max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy To disable custom events entirely, add the following to your newrelic.yml: custom_insights_events: enabled: false Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Java app. For Java agent versions prior to 4.1.0, use the following YAML configuration: custom_insights_events.enabled: true custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy .NET Custom event collection is enabled by default in .NET agent version 4.6.29.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call RecordCustomEvent(). For example: var eventAttributes = new Dictionary<String, Object>(); NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.RecordCustomEvent('MyCustomEvent', eventAttributes); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an IEnumerable with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your .NET app. You can turn off custom events entirely by setting customEvents.enabled to false in newrelic.config. Node.js Custom event collection is enabled by default in Node.js agent version 1.15.0 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can then add custom attributes for your Node.js app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.js. PHP Custom event collection is enabled by default in PHP agent version 4.18 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API function. For example: newrelic_record_custom_event(\"WidgetSale\", array(\"color\"=>\"red\", \"weight\"=>12.5)); Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is an array with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. By default, the maximum number of custom events recorded per minute is 10,000. This setting cannot be changed. You can then add custom attributes for your PHP app. To disable custom events entirely, add newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled = false to your newrelic.ini and restart the agent. Python Custom event collection is enabled by default in Python agent version 2.60.0.46 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: newrelic.agent. record_custom_event (event_type, params, application=None) Copy The event_type defines the name (or type) of the custom event. Attributes of the custom event should be passed in as a dictionary via the params keyword argument. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For limits and restrictions on event_type and params, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and reserved words If called outside of the context of a monitored web request or background task, the call will be ignored unless the application keyword argument is provided and an application object corresponding to the application against which the exception should be recorded is provided. A suitable application object can be obtained using the newrelic.agent.application() function. You can then add custom attributes for your Python app. To disable custom events entirely, set custom_insights_events.enabled to False in your newrelic.ini configuration file. Ruby Custom event collection is enabled by default in Ruby agent version 3.9.8.273 or higher. To send custom events, simply call the relevant API. For example: ::NewRelic::Agent.record_custom_event('WidgetSale', color: 'red', weight: 12.5) Copy The first argument defines the name of your event type, and the second argument is a hash with the attributes for your custom event. Ensure you limit the number of unique event type names that you create, and do not generate these names dynamically. For restrictions on event type names, see our documentation about limits and restricted characters and NRQL reserved words. You can change the maximum number of events recorded by the Ruby agent via a configuration parameter in newrelic.yml: Add custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: to your configuration file. Specify the maximum number of events to record per minute as an integer. For example, if you want to be able to send up to 5000 events per minute, add: custom_insights_events.max_samples_stored: 5000 Copy You can then add custom attributes for your Ruby app. To disable custom events entirely, add custom_insights_events.enabled: false to newrelic.yml. Timestamps You may not specify a timestamp on events that are collected and recorded via the agent. The agent will automatically assign a timestamp to events based on when they are recorded via the API. Limits and restricted characters See Custom event data requirements for size limits, data types, and naming syntax requirements. Reserved words Before creating custom attributes, review New Relic's list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Otherwise unexpected results may occur.",

      "body": "For accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan, we provide a View your usage UI for understanding billing-related usage and a Manage your data UI for managing billing-related data. Additionally, you can: Query your usage data to get more detail than is available in the UI. Set up NRQL alert conditions to get notifications about changes in your usage. Note that account hierarchy may affect queried data. See Account structure. Available data types Usage data is attached to these events: NrConsumption records usage every hour, and is the equivalent of \"real-time\" usage. Use this event to observe usage trends over time. NrMTDConsumption generates aggregate values from the NrConsumption event. Use this event to see usage or estimated cost for a billing period. NrUsage records usage every hour and is used to see usage reported per product. To see changes made to your account (for example, user management changes), you can query NrAuditEvent. Query examples The View your usage UI displays your data usage and billable user count. If you need more detail than that UI provides, you can use these NRQL queries. For definitions of some of the attributes used in these queries, see Attributes. Data usage queries Here are some data usage query examples: Daily data usage This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Daily usage by source This query totals your billable ingested data, and displays a daily value for the past three months faceted by the source: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE 3 months ago FACET usageMetric TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Metrics ingest by source This query breaks down Metric data by the top ten metric names. You could also facet by appName or host to adjust the analysis. FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate()/10e8 as 'GB Estimate' SINCE '2021-04-01' UNTIL '2021-04-08' FACET metricName LIMIT 10 TIMESERIES 1 day Copy Month-to-date data usage This query shows the current full user count. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your data for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Month-to-date estimated data cost This query shows the estimated cost of your ingested data: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy User count queries Here are some user-related query examples. For details on how users are counted, see User count calculations. Month-to-date full users This query shows the billable full users for the month. In other words, it shows how much you'd be billed for your users for that month if you were billed right now. FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) SINCE this month Copy This query shows how many full users were counted by hour. This is useful for seeing how the full user count changed over time. from NrConsumption SELECT max(FullUsers) SINCE 10 days ago TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Projected monthly full user count This query shows a projected count of monthly users. This query would not be good for using in a dashboard; it requires values based on a) the days remaining in the month, b) the start of the month. Here's an example querying the projected end-of-month count with 10 days left in that month: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT predictLinear(FullUsers, 10 days) SINCE '2020-09-01' Copy Count full users and basic users The usage UI shows the count of full users and basic users. The query used is: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric Copy To see the count of full and basic users over time: FROM NrUsage SELECT max(usage) SINCE 10 days ago WHERE productLine='FullStackObservability' WHERE metric in ('FullUsers', 'BasicUsers') FACET metric TIMESERIES 1 hour Copy Set usage alerts To help manage your billable data, you can set alerts to notify you of unexpected increases in usage. Learn how to create alerts with NRQL queries here. Caution When creating alert conditions, you should set the Evaluation offset value to 60 minutes or your conditions may not trigger. Here are some NRQL alert condition examples. For attribute definitions, see Attributes. Ingested gigabytes exceed a fixed value This query will create an alert when your hourly usage exceeds a fixed value: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy If you have multiple child accounts, you may want to set threshold alerts for a specific subaccount: FROM NrConsumption SELECT sum(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' AND consumingAccountId = YOUR_CHILD-ACCOUNT_ID Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for GBs This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for GBs: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(GigabytesIngested) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for users This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed monthly threshold for billable users: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(usersBillable) Copy Usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost This query will create an alert when your usage exceeds fixed threshold for estimated cost: FROM NrMTDConsumption SELECT latest(estimatedCost) WHERE productLine = 'DataPlatform' SINCE this month Copy Available attributes Below are some of the important attributes attached to usage events. Attribute Description productLine The category of usage. There are four options: DataPlatform, FullStackObservability, IncidentIntelligence, or ProactiveDetection. For more details about these categories, see New Relic platform. metric Consolidates multiple categories of usage into a single metric. Helpful when faceting by productLine. consumingAccountId ID of the New Relic account that is directly responsible for the stored events, as determined from the license key used. estimatedCost Calculates a cost estimate based on usage and metric cost. This is an estimate of costs to date, not your monthly invoice. For more attributes, see the data dictionary.",

      "body": "New Relic lets you see a 13-month history of synthetic monitoring audit events. Feature description When you take specific actions in synthetic monitoring like creating or editing a monitor, an NrAuditEvent is generated. This event includes details about the action taken and which user took that action. This data is stored for 13 months. This historical data may be helpful if you'd like to investigate how a problem with your account was created and who made that change. Synthetic monitoring's changes tracked include: Monitors Creation Edits (including location change, mute/unmute, and enable/disable) Script creation, edits, validation (including secure credentials used) Deletion Monitor downtimes Creation Edits Deletion Secure credentials Creation Edits Views Deletion Private locations Creation Edits (including clearing queues) Deletion For details on how to query this data, see Query details. Query details To query changes, use the query builder to explore the NrAuditEvent and its associated attributes. For an introduction to using the NrAuditEvent event, see Query account audit logs. Supported actionIdentifier events currently include: Monitors synthetics_monitor.create synthetics_monitor.update synthetics_monitor.create_script synthetics_monitor.update_script synthetics_monitor.validate_script synthetics_monitor.delete Monitor downtimes synthetics_monitor_downtime.create synthetics_monitor_downtime.update synthetics_monitor_downtime.delete Secure credentials synthetics_secure_credential.create synthetics_secure_credential.update synthetics_secure_credential.view synthetics_secure_credential.delete Private locations synthetics_private_location.create​ synthetics_private_location.update​ synthetics_private_location.delete How the change was made: The actorAPIKey attribute indicates if the change was made via the API or by a user via the UI. When this value is null, it's a user update; when not null, it's an API update. For examples of synthetic monitoring's audit log queries, see: The example use case. The synthetic monitoring specific examples in Audit query examples. Example use case: Finding changes made by a user Here's an example of using the synthetic monitoring audit log to solve a common problem: You are a manager at a company that uses synthetic monitoring. A new employee has been playing with your company's accounts to learn how synthetic monitoring works. Unfortunately, this employee was accidentally given full access to the production accounts, instead of the pre-production accounts. You want to determine what synthetic monitors this employee created, deleted, and updated, so that you will know which monitors need to be fixed. Instead of having to review every monitor in the account, you open the query builder and run the following NRQL query of the NrAuditEvent event: SELECT count(*) FROM NrAuditEvent WHERE actionIdentifier = 'synthetics_monitor.update_script' AND actorEmail = 'EMPLOYEE_EMAIL' FACET actionIdentifier, description SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 1000 Copy The query will return all the synthetic monitors that the employee has updated, deleted, created, disable, or muted. One by one, you and the employee review the list and update the edited monitors.",
