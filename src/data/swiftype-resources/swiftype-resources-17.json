      "body": "Problem For our APM, browser monitoring, and mobile monitoring features, there can be cases when an account or application is sending many individual metrics that could be better managed by grouping them together. We use the term metric grouping issue or MGI to describe this situation. When this occurs, the agent is sending unnecessarily large amounts of data to New Relic, which reduces the effectiveness of New Relic charts, tables, and reports. Metric grouping issues occur most commonly with web transactions, especially if the name is based on URLs. They can also happen with other metrics reported by your application. For example: If your application is crawling the Internet and each external call goes to a different domain If your software dynamically generates temporary database tables every time you receive a request If you are using custom instrumentation that includes UUIDs, article names, or similar unique components Any situation where a potentially infinite list of metrics can be created, rather than metrics being grouped effectively (as with controllers, permanent database tables, or specific external services) can become a metric grouping issue. Solution By understanding what metric grouping is and how issues can arise, you can better understand how New Relic works with your application to group metrics effectively and help prevent metric grouping issues from occurring. Here is a \"before\" and \"after\" example of how metric grouping can help organize transactions, to help you more easily identify patterns with performance problems. To help prevent metric grouping issues from occurring in your app: Check the New Relic release notes to verify you're running the most current version of the New Relic agent. If needed, upgrade your APM/mobile/browser agent to the most current version. Wait a few minutes, then look at new data in the New Relic UI. If the problem persists, follow the procedures for your agent: Agent Preventing MGIs All agents Review the information about what causes metric grouping issues. Browser Add URL groupings. C SDK Avoid using URLs to name your transactions. Instead, follow the procedures to instrument your app with the C SDK. Go Rename your Go transactions. Java See Java metric grouping issues. .NET Rename metrics with SetTransactionName. For more information about using XML to add details, see Name transactions. Node.js Rename transactions with Request API calls. PHP Rename your PHP transactions. Python Rename your Python transactions with set_transaction_name. Ruby Rename your Ruby transactions. Cause Metric grouping issues occur when the granularity of metric names (most often web transaction names) is too fine, resulting in hundreds or thousands of different web transaction names for just a small number of code paths. A few major code paths may generate many different full URL paths to unique documents, articles, or page, etc., and if the unique element of the URL path is included in the transaction name, each of these common paths will have its own unique name. MGI example In this example, you have an application that lets users write articles on any subject and post them for other users to see. Your application has three main functions: add an article, search for an article, and display an article. In order to improve search engine optimization (SEO), the \"view article\" code generates a unique URL to refer to each article. For example, the following URLs each refer to different articles in the example website: http://example.com/article/view/How_to_Install_New_Relic http://example.com/article/view/How_New_Relic_Saved_the_Day http://example.com/article/view/Where_do_I_get_New_Relic Copy All three articles are different; they contain different content and their URLs are different. However, the code path that generates each article is the same: they all use the \"view article\" function. Many web frameworks use this technique. They have a controller or route (in this case named article/view) as part of the URL. New Relic works to automatically identify these patterns and group similar routes together, to prevent metric grouping issues from occurring. Without mechanisms for detecting controllers, the example application would send metrics for each individual URL requested by visitors to your site. If you have a million articles and your site is popular, in each minute there could be several thousand unique URLs visited. This produces a significant amount of additional data to be sent to New Relic for each harvest cycle, and the APM Transactions page would attempt to list thousands of unique URLs, resulting in metric grouping issues. To monitor and improve your application performance, it's much more useful to know the average performance for a function (for example, viewing articles on your site) than how quickly each individual article is displayed. To prevent metric grouping issues, New Relic will normally show a single entry for that function (for example, /article/view/*) on the APM Transactions page. This grouping gives you a much better idea of how much time was spent viewing articles, and allows you to easily spot any performance problems related to viewing articles. If these statistics were spread across hundreds or thousands of transactions, detecting trends, regressions, or performance improvements would be extremely difficult. Each APM agent has distinct ways of detecting controllers and frameworks. Most are automatic, but a few require you to enable or disable options in a config file. You can also follow our recommendations to help prevent metric grouping issues from occurring.",

      "body": "Problem For our APM, browser monitoring, and mobile monitoring features, there can be cases when an account or application is sending many individual metrics that could be better managed by grouping them together. We use the term metric grouping issue or MGI to describe this situation. When this occurs, the agent is sending unnecessarily large amounts of data to New Relic, which reduces the effectiveness of New Relic charts, tables, and reports. Metric grouping issues occur most commonly with web transactions, especially if the name is based on URLs. They can also happen with other metrics reported by your application. For example: If your application is crawling the Internet and each external call goes to a different domain If your software dynamically generates temporary database tables every time you receive a request If you are using custom instrumentation that includes UUIDs, article names, or similar unique components Any situation where a potentially infinite list of metrics can be created, rather than metrics being grouped effectively (as with controllers, permanent database tables, or specific external services) can become a metric grouping issue. Solution By understanding what metric grouping is and how issues can arise, you can better understand how New Relic works with your application to group metrics effectively and help prevent metric grouping issues from occurring. Here is a \"before\" and \"after\" example of how metric grouping can help organize transactions, to help you more easily identify patterns with performance problems. To help prevent metric grouping issues from occurring in your app: Check the New Relic release notes to verify you're running the most current version of the New Relic agent. If needed, upgrade your APM/mobile/browser agent to the most current version. Wait a few minutes, then look at new data in the New Relic UI. If the problem persists, follow the procedures for your agent: Agent Preventing MGIs All agents Review the information about what causes metric grouping issues. Browser Add URL groupings. C SDK Avoid using URLs to name your transactions. Instead, follow the procedures to instrument your app with the C SDK. Go Rename your Go transactions. Java See Java metric grouping issues. .NET Rename metrics with SetTransactionName. For more information about using XML to add details, see Name transactions. Node.js Rename transactions with Request API calls. PHP Rename your PHP transactions. Python Rename your Python transactions with set_transaction_name. Ruby Rename your Ruby transactions. Cause Metric grouping issues occur when the granularity of metric names (most often web transaction names) is too fine, resulting in hundreds or thousands of different web transaction names for just a small number of code paths. A few major code paths may generate many different full URL paths to unique documents, articles, or page, etc., and if the unique element of the URL path is included in the transaction name, each of these common paths will have its own unique name. MGI example In this example, you have an application that lets users write articles on any subject and post them for other users to see. Your application has three main functions: add an article, search for an article, and display an article. In order to improve search engine optimization (SEO), the \"view article\" code generates a unique URL to refer to each article. For example, the following URLs each refer to different articles in the example website: http://example.com/article/view/How_to_Install_New_Relic http://example.com/article/view/How_New_Relic_Saved_the_Day http://example.com/article/view/Where_do_I_get_New_Relic Copy All three articles are different; they contain different content and their URLs are different. However, the code path that generates each article is the same: they all use the \"view article\" function. Many web frameworks use this technique. They have a controller or route (in this case named article/view) as part of the URL. New Relic works to automatically identify these patterns and group similar routes together, to prevent metric grouping issues from occurring. Without mechanisms for detecting controllers, the example application would send metrics for each individual URL requested by visitors to your site. If you have a million articles and your site is popular, in each minute there could be several thousand unique URLs visited. This produces a significant amount of additional data to be sent to New Relic for each harvest cycle, and the APM Transactions page would attempt to list thousands of unique URLs, resulting in metric grouping issues. To monitor and improve your application performance, it's much more useful to know the average performance for a function (for example, viewing articles on your site) than how quickly each individual article is displayed. To prevent metric grouping issues, New Relic will normally show a single entry for that function (for example, /article/view/*) on the APM Transactions page. This grouping gives you a much better idea of how much time was spent viewing articles, and allows you to easily spot any performance problems related to viewing articles. If these statistics were spread across hundreds or thousands of transactions, detecting trends, regressions, or performance improvements would be extremely difficult. Each APM agent has distinct ways of detecting controllers and frameworks. Most are automatic, but a few require you to enable or disable options in a config file. You can also follow our recommendations to help prevent metric grouping issues from occurring.",

For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. If you need to record and view information about all data your app transmits to New Relic, you can enable audit logging for short periods of time. This is useful, for example, with debugging or auditing, when you need detailed information about what exactly is being transmitted. Caution Be sure to disable audit logging as soon as you are finished using it. This feature causes additional overhead, which may overload the audit log file if left turned on for extended periods of time. APM agent audit logging For details about the audit logging options for your APM agent's configuration file, see the agent-specific documentation: Agent Configuration file C SDK When starting the C SDK daemon, add -auditlog <file> to the daemon configuration file. For example: ./newrelic-daemon -f -logfile stdout -loglevel debug -auditlog audit.log Copy Go Logging is optional with the Go agent. If you are using newrelic.NewLogger(w) and want more detailed output, change newrelic.NewLogger(w) to newrelic.NewDebugLogger(w). For more information, see the New Relic Go logging documentation on GitHub. Java Set audit_mode to true. .NET Set auditLog to true. Node.js New Relic's Node.js agent does not use separate audit logs because the payload is already available in the configuration logs. To view increasing levels of detail, use your config file's logging level variables. PHP Use PHP newrelic.daemon.auditlog (for newrelic.ini) or auditlog (for newrelic.cfg).

      "body": "Every New Relic agent includes strong safeguards to ensure data security. For example, New Relic automatically encrypts sensitive information before it is transmitted. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. If you need to record and view information about all data your app transmits to New Relic, you can enable audit logging for short periods of time. This is useful, for example, with debugging or auditing, when you need detailed information about what exactly is being transmitted. Caution Be sure to disable audit logging as soon as you are finished using it. This feature causes additional overhead, which may overload the audit log file if left turned on for extended periods of time. APM agent audit logging For details about the audit logging options for your APM agent's configuration file, see the agent-specific documentation: Agent Configuration file C SDK When starting the C SDK daemon, add -auditlog <file> to the daemon configuration file. For example: ./newrelic-daemon -f -logfile stdout -loglevel debug -auditlog audit.log Copy Go Logging is optional with the Go agent. If you are using newrelic.NewLogger(w) and want more detailed output, change newrelic.NewLogger(w) to newrelic.NewDebugLogger(w). For more information, see the New Relic Go logging documentation on GitHub. Java Set audit_mode to true. .NET Set auditLog to true. Node.js New Relic's Node.js agent does not use separate audit logs because the payload is already available in the configuration logs. To view increasing levels of detail, use your config file's logging level variables. PHP Use PHP newrelic.daemon.auditlog (for newrelic.ini) or auditlog (for newrelic.cfg). Python Use Python audit_log_file values. Ruby Use audit_log values. For more information, see Ruby agent audit log.

      "body": "Problem For our APM, browser monitoring, and mobile monitoring features, there can be cases when an account or application is sending many individual metrics that could be better managed by grouping them together. We use the term metric grouping issue or MGI to describe this situation. When this occurs, the agent is sending unnecessarily large amounts of data to New Relic, which reduces the effectiveness of New Relic charts, tables, and reports. Metric grouping issues occur most commonly with web transactions, especially if the name is based on URLs. They can also happen with other metrics reported by your application. For example: If your application is crawling the Internet and each external call goes to a different domain If your software dynamically generates temporary database tables every time you receive a request If you are using custom instrumentation that includes UUIDs, article names, or similar unique components Any situation where a potentially infinite list of metrics can be created, rather than metrics being grouped effectively (as with controllers, permanent database tables, or specific external services) can become a metric grouping issue. Solution By understanding what metric grouping is and how issues can arise, you can better understand how New Relic works with your application to group metrics effectively and help prevent metric grouping issues from occurring. Here is a \"before\" and \"after\" example of how metric grouping can help organize transactions, to help you more easily identify patterns with performance problems. To help prevent metric grouping issues from occurring in your app: Check the New Relic release notes to verify you're running the most current version of the New Relic agent. If needed, upgrade your APM/mobile/browser agent to the most current version. Wait a few minutes, then look at new data in the New Relic UI. If the problem persists, follow the procedures for your agent: Agent Preventing MGIs All agents Review the information about what causes metric grouping issues. Browser Add URL groupings. C SDK Avoid using URLs to name your transactions. Instead, follow the procedures to instrument your app with the C SDK. Go Rename your Go transactions. Java See Java metric grouping issues. .NET Rename metrics with SetTransactionName. For more information about using XML to add details, see Name transactions. Node.js Rename transactions with Request API calls. PHP Rename your PHP transactions. Python Rename your Python transactions with set_transaction_name. Ruby Rename your Ruby transactions. Cause Metric grouping issues occur when the granularity of metric names (most often web transaction names) is too fine, resulting in hundreds or thousands of different web transaction names for just a small number of code paths. A few major code paths may generate many different full URL paths to unique documents, articles, or page, etc., and if the unique element of the URL path is included in the transaction name, each of these common paths will have its own unique name. MGI example In this example, you have an application that lets users write articles on any subject and post them for other users to see. Your application has three main functions: add an article, search for an article, and display an article. In order to improve search engine optimization (SEO), the \"view article\" code generates a unique URL to refer to each article. For example, the following URLs each refer to different articles in the example website: http://example.com/article/view/How_to_Install_New_Relic http://example.com/article/view/How_New_Relic_Saved_the_Day http://example.com/article/view/Where_do_I_get_New_Relic Copy All three articles are different; they contain different content and their URLs are different. However, the code path that generates each article is the same: they all use the \"view article\" function. Many web frameworks use this technique. They have a controller or route (in this case named article/view) as part of the URL. New Relic works to automatically identify these patterns and group similar routes together, to prevent metric grouping issues from occurring. Without mechanisms for detecting controllers, the example application would send metrics for each individual URL requested by visitors to your site. If you have a million articles and your site is popular, in each minute there could be several thousand unique URLs visited. This produces a significant amount of additional data to be sent to New Relic for each harvest cycle, and the APM Transactions page would attempt to list thousands of unique URLs, resulting in metric grouping issues. To monitor and improve your application performance, it's much more useful to know the average performance for a function (for example, viewing articles on your site) than how quickly each individual article is displayed. To prevent metric grouping issues, New Relic will normally show a single entry for that function (for example, /article/view/*) on the APM Transactions page. This grouping gives you a much better idea of how much time was spent viewing articles, and allows you to easily spot any performance problems related to viewing articles. If these statistics were spread across hundreds or thousands of transactions, detecting trends, regressions, or performance improvements would be extremely difficult. Each APM agent has distinct ways of detecting controllers and frameworks. Most are automatic, but a few require you to enable or disable options in a config file. You can also follow our recommendations to help prevent metric grouping issues from occurring.",

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABLE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABLE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

      "body": "Access any of your New Relic One dashboards to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data. Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "The Insights Dashboard API is deprecated, but you can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to create and configure dashboards. If you're not migrating from the old Insights API, you can skip this doc and go to the new Dashboards API. Why a new dashboards API? Our Insights product, which was a way to query data and create charts and dashboards, has been deprecated and its set of features moved over to be a core part of the New Relic One platform. To learn more about this transition and new features, see the Insights to New Relic One migration guide. The Insights Dashboard API will be deprecated in July of 2021. Until then, if you're using the Insights Dashboard API, you should attempt to switch over to using NerdGraph. (The Insights query API will not be deprecated but NerdGraph is preferred.) Keep reading to learn how to get started with NerdGraph and learn about equivalent operations. Get started with NerdGraph NerdGraph is the preferred API for making NRQL queries of your New Relic data. Every user who uses NerdGraph needs their own user key. When using NerdGraph, it helps to understand that our dashboards are entities that report data from other entities, such as monitored apps, hosts and services. If you're new to NerdGraph and GraphQL, you may want to first read our Introduction to NerdGraph and some of Create dashboards with NerdGraph. The NerdGraph API explorer is located at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Operations mapping table The table below maps every Insights API operation to the new dashboards API. Insights API operation NerdGraph API query/mutation Notes List (GET) entitySearch() View a paginated list of dashboards that match the filter.

By using the NerdGraph API explorer, you can discover GraphQL types and fields, along with a brief explanation. We want to facilitate your migration from the Insights API to the new New Relic One dashboards API. Find below some examples that illustrate how the old REST endpoints map to the new GraphQL queries or mutations. List (GET) -> entitySearch query Dashboards in New Relic One embrace the concept of entity. They are now another entity in New Relic’s entity ecosystem. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. List all dashboard entities you have access to { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by name { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {name: \"My dashboard\"}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by creator’s email { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD, tags: {key: \"createdBy\", value: \"email@domain.com\"}}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by creator’s user id { actor { entitySearch(query: \"type ='DASHBOARD' and ownerId = '2357322'\") { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy Show (GET) -> entity query In order to get information on a dashboard, all you need is to provide its unique entity identifier or entity guid. Then you can access all the dashboard properties that you are interested in by adding them in the GraphQL query. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Get dashboard info given its entity guid { actor { entity(guid: \"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { ... on DashboardEntity { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } } Copy Create (POST) -> dashboardCreate mutation Operations that mutate the state of the system are mutations in GraphQL APIs. You can create a dashboard by providing the required input for the dashboardCreate mutation. Although GraphQL APIs aim to be self-explanatory, Nerdgraph docs can help you with some information about the fields, like the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Create dashboard with two pages and two widgets per page mutation { dashboardCreate(accountId: 1, dashboard: { name: \"My awesome dashboard\", permissions: PUBLIC_READ_WRITE, pages: [{ name: \"My first page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.markdown\" }, title: \"My markdown widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { text: \"#My markdown\" } }, { visualization: { id: \"viz.line\" }, title: \"My line widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 5, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" }] } }] }, { name: \"My second page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.billboard\" }, title: \"My billboard widget with thresholds\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction\" }], thresholds: [{ alertSeverity: WARNING, value: 650 }, { alertSeverity: CRITICAL, value: 1500 }] } }, { visualization: { id: \"viz.table\" }, title: \"My table widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 5, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\", accountId: 1 }] } }] }] }) { errors { description type } entityResult { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } Copy Update (PUT) -> dashboardUpdate mutation The dashboardUpdate mutation allows you to update an existing dashboard by providing the existing dashboard guid and the new configuration. Similarly to creating a dashboard, the mutation tries to be self-explanatory, but you can look up the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Update previously created dashboard to 1 page and 1 widget per page mutation { dashboardUpdate(guid: \"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\" dashboard: { name: \"My awesome dashboard\", permissions: PUBLIC_READ_WRITE, pages: [{ name: \"My first page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.line\" }, title: \"My line widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" }] } }] }, { name: \"My second page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.table\" }, title: \"My table widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\", accountId: 1 }] } }] }] }) { errors { description type } entityResult { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } Copy Delete (DELETE) -> dashboardDelete mutation The dashboardDelete mutation allows you to delete an existing dashboard by providing its entity guid. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Delete previously created dashboard mutation { dashboardDelete(guid:\"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { status errors { type description } } } Copy",

      "body": "New Relic offers a variety of APIs and SDKs you can use to: Send data to New Relic. Retrieve data from New Relic. View and configure settings. This document provides examples and reference information for our APIs. APIs for data ingest Our four primary data ingest APIs are some of the many solutions for reporting data to New Relic. These APIs can be used directly, but they're also the underlying ingest route for any of our tools that use those APIs (for example, our OpenTelemetry integration, or our Telemetry SDKs). API type Description Metric API Send dimensional metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Event API Send custom event data to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. Log API Send log data to New Relic. Trace API Send distributed tracing data (also referred to as \"spans\") to New Relic without the use of an agent or integration. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is the API we recommend for querying New Relic data, querying account information, and making a range of feature configurations. To learn what you can do, check out the NerdGraph tutorials. NerdGraph is our newest API and is our attempt to bring together in one place some of our older APIs, like our REST API. Note that there is still some functionality you can do with REST APIs that can't yet be done with NerdGraph, and this is why some New Relic organizations still use the REST API. REST API Our REST API is our older API for querying and configuration, which NerdGraph is in the process of replacing. The REST API has some configuration abilities that NerdGraph doesn't yet have, but when possible you should use NerdGraph. The REST API can be used for a wide range of features: for detail, see APIs by feature. APIs by feature New Relic tools and features, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, browser monitoring, and alerts, are often used together, and sometimes can overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings. Mobile monitoring Mobile API resources include: Resource Details Mobile agent APIs Mobile APIs let you custom instrument your own code and send events to New Relic. See the platform-specific documentation: iOS Android REST API Use the REST API for such tasks as: Retrieve a list of monitored apps. Get subscription usage data. Get metric names and data. Get crash count and crash rate data. Manage New Relic alerts conditions for your mobile apps. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Account management APIs For account-related APIs, see Account APIs. Synthetic monitoring Synthetics API resources include: Resource Details Synthetics REST API The Synthetics REST API functionality includes: Create and manage synthetics monitors. Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To query New Relic data, use NerdGraph. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage (original pricing model) For organizations on our original pricing model, you can use NerdGraph to query subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API If you're a New Relic partnership organization, you can use the Partner API to retrieve data and make configurations. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing models that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API Our Insights Query API is mostly deprecated. Instead, use NerdGraph for querying your New Relic data. Dashboard API Use the Dashboards API.",

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABLE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

      "body": "Access any of your New Relic One dashboards to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data. Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABLE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

      "body": "Access any of your New Relic One dashboards to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data. Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABLE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABLE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

Global Performance data sets data are useful for: Existing New Relic customers who want to gain general monitoring and troubleshooting insights from a curated collection of aggregated, real-world data. Newcomers who want to get a feel for New Relic’s dashboards and data tools and view real data visualizations in order to make informed decisions about how to add their own data to New Relic. This resource provides information about the Global Performance data sets, how they work, what they do, and current options for accessing Global Performance data. Public API Performance dashboard Important Please note: Global Performance data sets are presented as-is. Global Performance data sets represent an aggregate of samples across a range of sources, and New Relic makes no effort to attempt to confirm the correctness, completeness, or veracity of the data. This data should not be relied on as the sole source of information for any purpose you may use it, and New Relic is not responsible for decisions made in reliance on this data. Global Performance data sets should not be viewed as either an endorsement or a recommendation by New Relic of the technologies represented in the data sets. Access valuable data and try out New Relic Our first Global Performance data set, Public API Performance, offers a large body of real-world, real-time data about the performance of public APIs including AWS, Google, and more as experienced by New Relic customers (as authorized). Because this data is already flowing through New Relic, you can access it within seconds of activating your account, and test drive New Relic dashboarding and querying capabilities in the process. There’s no need to connect your own data sources to New Relic first, although we recommend you do so because adding your own data is easy, free, and the best way to understand how New Relic can serve your business needs. Get started with the Public API Performance dashboard To help you get started using Public API Performance data, we've created a Public API Performance dashboard. This dashboard provides both actionable general insights and analytics and also an example of how you might apply dashboarding capabilities to your own data.

You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "The New Relic platform is built around the four fundamental telemetry data types we believe are necessary for complete and effective system monitoring: metrics, events, logs, and traces. After you sign up for a free New Relic account and install any of our monitoring services, you can start working with your data. Get started This doc will give you a fairly technical explanation of our core data types, their structure, and how they're used in our features. You can use most of our features without needing to understand the underlying data structure. But having a better understanding of this can help you get data into New Relic, understand the data you see in our UI, and query your data. For a simpler explanation of these data types using real-world examples, see Introduction to essential telemetry data types. Another good way to understand your data is to just start querying it. Tip Access your data easily on one.newrelic.com: Click the Browse data dropdown menu and select the data type (metrics, events, logs, and traces) you want to explore. Metrics First, we’ll explain the definition of metrics from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain how New Relic handles metrics. For a list of the metrics we collect, see our documentation on metrics. Metrics in the monitoring industry In the software monitoring industry, a metric means a numeric measurement of an application or system. Metrics are typically reported on a regular schedule. Two major types of metrics are: Aggregated data. For example: a count of events over one minute’s time, or the rate of some event per minute. A numeric status at a moment in time. For example: a CPU temperature reading, or a “CPU% used” status. Metrics are relatively easy to report and store because a single record can represent a range of time. They can also be aggregated more and more over time. For example, per-minute data may be “rolled up” to per-hour aggregations after some amount of time, and eventually may be rolled up to a per-day aggregation. This approach is efficient for long-term data storage. Metrics are a strong solution for storing data long-term, and understanding trends over time. One potential downside is that it can be difficult to do detailed analysis of older data that has been aggregated over time; when high detail is required about specific important actions, event data can be used. Metrics at New Relic Conceptually, \"metrics\" is a broad, general category. There are various ways New Relic measures and reports metrics but, in practice, when using the New Relic UI, you usually won't have to understand how exactly this happens. In our documentation, we typically will just refer to \"metrics,\" regardless of how that data is reported, unless there's a reason you need to know more (like understanding how to query your data). Here are some of the ways metrics are reported and stored across the New Relic platform: Dimensional metrics (used by Metric API and many integrations) In the monitoring industry, \"dimensional\" metrics refer to metric data that has a variety of attributes (dimensions) attached, such as duration-related attributes (start time, end time), entity ID, region, host, etc. This amount of detail allows for in-depth analysis and querying. At New Relic, this metric data is attached to the Metric data type and is sent from several sources: Some open-source integrations, such as the Prometheus exporter. Our Telemetry SDKs Infrastructure services The Metric API (the underlying API used by the above tools) The events-to-metrics service To query this data and see its attributes (\"dimensions\"), you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Metric Copy As time passes, these metrics are increasingly aggregated into larger time buckets. This is done to optimize your ability to query data over a long period of time. For more details about the metric data type, see our docs. To learn how this data is ingested and stored, see the Metric API documentation. For tips on querying, see Metric query examples. Metric timeslice data (used by APM, browser, mobile) New Relic's APM, browser, and mobile report and display metrics in a simple data format that we refer to as metric timeslice data. A metric timeslice consists of three parts: a metric name, the segment of time the metric represents (the \"timeslice\"), and a numeric value (the measurement). For example: an APM metric timeslice for time spent in a particular transaction is named WebTransaction/URI/foo, and might have a response time of 0.793 for a one-minute time slice from 10:20am to 10:21am. These metrics usually follow a pattern like <category>/<class>/<method>. Our agents (APM, browser, and mobile) can collect thousands of metric timeslices per minute for a variety of performance metrics. For example: error rate, bandwidth usage, and garbage collection time. You also have the ability to create custom metrics. Metric timeslice data is a lightweight data type and lacks the detail that dimensional metrics have. Ways to explore and query metric timeslice data: For APM: metric timeslice data is converted to dimensional metrics and can be queried via NRQL Use the REST API If you want to learn more about the structure of metric timeslice data and see some examples, expand the collapser below. Metric timeslice examples Here are some common metric timeslice data examples, with a focus on common ones used by Ruby applications. ActiveMerchant New Relic tracks a variety of metrics on ActiveMerchant transactions which can be used for business analytics as well as performance monitoring. The metrics are summarized by operation as well as by gateway. regex sample metric legend name ActiveMerchant/. * ActiveMerchant/PayJunctionGateway ActiveMerchant/gateway/. * ActiveMerchant/gateway/PayJunctionGateway/purchase PayJunctionGateway ActiveMerchant/operation/. * ActiveMerchant/operation/purchase purchase For more information, see the ActiveMerchant website. ActiveRecord ActiveRecord is the Object-Relational Mapping API used by Ruby on Rails applications. The metrics shown here measure the performance of ActiveRecord's find and save methods. regex sample metric legend name ActiveRecord/. * /find ActiveRecord/User/find User#find ActiveRecord/. * /save ActiveRecord/Product/save Product#save For more information, see the API documentation for ActiveRecord. Apdex Apdex is a measure of user satisfaction with page load times. Controller In Ruby on Rails applications, HTTP requests are handled by Controller actions. A Rails application has many controllers, each of which has one or more actions. When your rails application receives an http request, that request is routed to the appropriate controller and action, based on the URL of that request. That action then does whatever processing is neccesary to generate an http response, which is most often a web page, but could also be a page fragment, an xml document, or any other kind of data that is requested by the client. The following metrics track the performance of controller actions, regardless of routing, and without taking into account any network or web server effects. regex sample metric legend name Controller/. * Controller/Users/show /Users/show Controller/. * /(?! \\ (other \\ )). * Controller/Users/show /Users/show Controller$ Controller All Controller Actions ControllerCPU/ ControllerCPU/Users/Show /Users/show For more information, see the API documentation for ActionController. Errors This metric tracks the number of errors or exceptions raised while processing requests. regex sample metric legend name Errors/all Errors/all External services External service instrumentation captures calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud and any other network calls. It does not include other first class back-end components such as MemCache and the database. In Ruby applications we instrument the Net::Http library to capture all HTTP services. regex sample metric legend name External/ [ ^/]+/all$ External/service.example.com/all All service.example.com calls External/ External/host.aws.com/Net::Http : :POST Net::Http : :POST [ host.aws.com] External/all$ External/all External Services External/ [ ^/]+/(?!all)/ External/service.example.com/all All service.example.com calls HTTP dispatcher This metric represents a summary of the throughput and response time of all web requests. regex sample metric legend name ^HttpDispatcher$ HttpDispatcher HttpDispatcher MemCache MemCache is a popular technology that enables applications to access shared memory provided by any number of physical machines as a global cache. Applications that heavily use the database often use MemCache for performance and scalability benefits. These metrics measure the frequency and response time of calls to MemCache to read and write data from the cache. Response times should be low (less than 5 ms) for a well performing MemCache deployment. regex sample metric legend name MemCache/. * MemCache/read MemCache read operations MemCache/read MemCache/read MemCache read operations MemCache/write MemCache/write MemCache write operations Mongrel This metric measures the length of the mongrel queue, which holds pending http requests to be processed by mongrel. The HTTP Activity graph overlays the maximimum queue length for a given period. The value is zero if mongrel is processing a request but has no other requests waiting in its queue. When looking at this value across an aggregate cluster of mongrels, the queue lengths of all mongrels is added together, showing the sum of all queue lengths. A mongrel queue length should be at or near zero; if it is consistently at a higher level, then it indicates that your rails application is having trouble keeping up with its load requirements. regex sample metric legend name Mongrel/Queue Length Mongrel/Queue Length Queue Length View ActionView is a package in Rails that is used to render the output that is the response to an http request, such as an html page or an xml document. The View is rendered by the controller that is handling the request. If View metrics represent a large portion of your controller's response time, it could mean you are doing a lot of database operations inside the view template itself. regex sample metric legend name View/. * View/Users/ _ child.html.erb/Partial Users/ _ child.html.erb View/. * /Partial View/Users/ _ child.html.erb/Partial Users/ _ child.html.erb View/. * /Rendering View/Users/show.html.erb/Rendering Users/show.html.erb For more information, see the API documentation for ActionView. Metrics attached to events (used by Infrastructure, other products) Because event-type data can have any type of key-value pair data attached to it, one way metrics can be reported is as attributes attached to an event. A couple examples of this at New Relic: Our infrastructure monitoring reports many metrics that are attached to events. For example, we report a ProcessSample event, which has various sample-based metrics attached to it, like CPU percentage. To learn more about infrastructure monitoring data, see Infrastructure data. In APM, the Transaction event has several metrics attached to it, including databaseDuration. To learn more about this data and how to query it, see Events. Metrics as a computation of events (used in some charts and queries) Metrics can be formed by counting New Relic events, or doing some other mathematical calculation on those events. For example, if you wanted to measure the total number of Transaction events over the last half hour, you might run this NRQL query: Select count(*) from Transaction since 30 minutes ago Copy Another example: if you wanted to compute the average response time for your service, you might run a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) SINCE 30 minutes ago Copy Some New Relic charts are generated with these kinds of queries. The downside of this approach is that there are limits on how many events a monitoring system (including ours) can report. This means that sometimes, for high-throughput systems, the count may not accurately represent the total activity on that system. To learn more about how this can be addressed, see Event limits and sampling. Want to report custom metrics? See Get data into New Relic. Event data First, we’ll explain the definition of events from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain some specifics about how New Relic handles event data. Events in the monitoring industry In the software industry, events can be thought of as simply “things that occur in a system.” For example, a server setting being changed would be an event. Another example: a website user clicking a mouse. Some events will generate a stored record, and that record is typically also called an event. Event data represents discrete occurrences and typically will have a high level of detail, so event data is suited for detailed analysis and querying. The downside to the use of event data is that there are typically so many events reported that it can become difficult to query that large dataset over longer time ranges. Events at New Relic At New Relic, we report events to data objects also called events. These events have multiple attributes (key-value pairs) attached. Event data is used in some UI charts and tables, and you can also query it. How long event data remains available is determined by data retention rules. One example of an event: APM reports an event type named Transaction, which represents a logical unit of work in an application. To see the attributes attached to this event, you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Transaction Copy For examples of querying event data, see Introduction to NRQL. Other details about New Relic event data: Events can have any type of attributes attached. Some events have attributes that report metric data. You can report custom events. To increase the availability of your event data for querying/charting, you can turn events into metrics. Some systems generate a large number of events that exceeds collection limits and results in incomplete query results. For more on this, see Event sampling. Because event is a general term, in some New Relic contexts it will refer to any data type that can be queried via NRQL. For example, when you run a NRQL query, it returns a count of inspected events: this is a count of all data types queried. Log data First, we’ll explain the definition of logs from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain some specifics about how New Relic handles log reporting. Logs in the monitoring industry A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. Logs at New Relic New Relic's Logs gives you a centralized log management platform that connects your log data with other New Relic-monitored data. For example, you can see logs alongside your APM data. In New Relic, log data is reported with multiple attributes (key-value data) attached. To query your log data, you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Log Copy To report custom log data, see the Log API. Trace data First, we’ll explain the definition of traces from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain some specifics about how New Relic handles tracing. Tracing in the monitoring industry In the application/infrastructure-monitoring world, tracing is a general term used to refer to various ways to report information about how a program or system is operating. For example, a stack trace provides in-depth information about a program’s subroutines. For large modern systems, which are often distributed across many services and micro-services, “tracing” often refers to distributed tracing, which is a way to monitor requests as they propagate through a complex, distributed environment. Tracing at New Relic New Relic offers a distributed tracing feature that tracks requests across a distributed system, and provides a dedicated UI for understanding and analyzing your traces. In New Relic, trace data is reported as Span objects, with multiple attributes (key-value pairs) attached. To query your tracing data, you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Span Copy To learn more about how distributed tracing works, see Understand distributed tracing. To report custom distributed tracing data, see the Trace API.

Metric types The metric type determines how the data is aggregated over longer time windows. It also determines which functions you can use to query the data. Metric types Description Available query functions count Measures the number of occurrences of an event. The count should be reset to 0 every time the metric is reported. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. You must specify a value for interval.ms when reporting the count metric type using the Metric API. The value must be a positive double. Generally, you want to take the rate of the sum: From Metric select rate(sum(myMetric), 1 minute) . . . sum distribution Tracks the statistical distribution on a numeric attribute. This metric is re-aggregatable. For example, 1-minute data points from 60 minutes can be aggregated into a 1-hour data point, without degradation on accuracy. This type: Supports statistical functions like percentile and histogram, and all functions supported by the summary type. Uses the same algorithm as the percentile function. percentile histogram min max sum count average gauge Represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include the temperature, CPU usage, and memory. For example, there is always a temperature, but you are periodically taking the temperature and reporting it. The value must fit into the range of a Java double. latest min max sum count average summary Used to report pre-aggregated data, or information on aggregated discrete events. A summary includes a count, sum value, min value, and max value. The count value must be positive. Examples include transaction count/durations and queue count/ durations. You must specify a value for interval.ms when reporting the summary metric type using the Metric API. min max sum count average uniqueCount Tracks the number of unique values on a string or numeric attribute. This metric is re-aggregatable. For example, 1-minute data points from 60 minutes can be aggregated into a 1-hour data point, without degradation on accuracy.

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABLE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

      "body": "Access any of your New Relic One dashboards to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data. Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "Use the New Relic One query builder in basic mode to create a chart without having to use NRQL, our querying language. The basic mode helps guides you through a query-creation process. You can choose the source of the raw data, apply filters, and use other techniques to narrow the scope of the data in the chart. Important As of September 1, 2021, we are discontinuing support of the query builder's basic mode. Instead, you can use our data explorer's user-friendly and intuitive functionality in New Relic One. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Data type The query builder basic mode has a Data type selector with two options: Events: In this context, this refers to all our non-Metric-type data, including events, logs, and trace data. Metrics: This refers to our dimensional Metric data type. You can also use this to query some types of metric timeslice data. For more on other types of metrics, see Data types. Example of using basic mode This example shows how to create a chart in basic mode. Step 1: Select the source of the data for a chart Begin by specifying what data you want to view in your chart. Click in the View a chart with box to select the event type, an attribute, and a function to perform on the attribute. You can use the event data dictionary to view information about an event type and its attributes on a single page. To see a tooltip with information about an event or attribute, hover over any term that has a dotted line underneath it. Here are the results of using the event data dictionary to specify the data: Event type. The Transaction event type measures a variety of data that describes what happens while a user is on a website, such as that user clicking on a button on a page. Attribute. The name attribute stores information on all transactions. Function. Select the unique_count function to get a count of all the transactions that occurred during the time frame. Basic mode now shows the selection: one.newrelic.com > Query builder > Basic > (event and attribute specified) As you specify data, the chart updates to show you the results from the data you specified. Based on the information specified so far, you can see a chart that shows the total number of transactions during the default time frame of 30 minutes. This total includes all transactions, whether the transaction was completed successfully or had errors. one.newrelic.com > Query builder > Basic > (event and attribute specified) Step 2: Filter the data Your next step is to determine which of those transactions got a 404 page not found error. If you look in the data dictionary for the Transaction event, you'll find this event also includes an attribute called httpResponseCode. Narrow the results to show only those transactions where a page not found error occurred. Use the Narrow results to box to create this filter: httpResponseCode = 404 . Because you want to be able to see the names of the apps that are resulting in the 404 errors, you use the Facet by box to see the results by appName (which is also an attribute for the Transaction event type). Faceting by appName updates the chart to break down the total number of 404 errors by the application names. This lets you know which apps are experiencing 404 errors. Your chart now shows the line chart with a line for each app, each with its own color. one.newrelic.com > Query builder > Basic > (event and attribute specified) > (filters and facets applied) Step 3: Adjust time range and limits You decide to focus on the five apps with the most page not found errors. The default value for the Limit field is 10, meaning that your chart will show the ten most relevant returns. You change that value to 5. Customer support told you that they had been getting calls about these errors for a little over two hours. You decide to change the time range from the last 30 minutes to the last three hours so that you can view the errors during the time when the customers were calling support. Now that you have the data set so that you are seeing exactly what you need, you can turn your attention to the appearance of the chart. Step 4: Customize the chart Because you are more interested in the total number of errors than a timeline view, you change the chart type to a bar chart. one.newrelic.com > Query builder > Basic > (event and attribute specified) > (filters and facets applied) > (time range and limit customized) > (chart type customized) When you're finished with your chart, you can add it to a dashboard or share it. This table contains notes about using basic mode. Item Description Prompts You can start typing directly in an empty box; a list of items that match the information you type will display. You can also click on an empty box to view a list of all of the items that are appropriate for the field, based on your earlier choices. Saving a basic mode data specification Every time you run a query, that query is saved in the My recent queries dropdown in advanced (NRQL) mode. Events Basic mode only supports data for one event and attribute. If you want to use more than one event and/or attribute, use the SELECT statement in advanced (NRQL) mode. Shortcuts Basic mode contains shortcuts that can display more complex events and attributes that aren't generally supported, as in this example (which shows the tooltip for the shortcut). Example of the Response time histogram shortcut, showing a tooltip. Tooltips Any time you see a dotted line under a term, you can hover over that term to see a tooltip with an explanation of the term. Narrow by You can use more than one Narrow by definition in basic mode filter; the conditions will be joined by AND. The WHERE clause in advanced (NRQL) allows OR in addition to AND. Important If your query was started using basic mode and if you make changes to that query using advanced (NRQL) mode, you cannot return to basic mode to edit that query. Any additional changes may only be made in advanced (NRQL) mode.",

In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABLE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

      "body": "Access any of your New Relic One dashboards to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data. Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "Use the New Relic One query builder in basic mode to create a chart without having to use NRQL, our querying language. The basic mode helps guides you through a query-creation process. You can choose the source of the raw data, apply filters, and use other techniques to narrow the scope of the data in the chart. Important As of September 1, 2021, we are discontinuing support of the query builder's basic mode. Instead, you can use our data explorer's user-friendly and intuitive functionality in New Relic One. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Data type The query builder basic mode has a Data type selector with two options: Events: In this context, this refers to all our non-Metric-type data, including events, logs, and trace data. Metrics: This refers to our dimensional Metric data type. You can also use this to query some types of metric timeslice data. For more on other types of metrics, see Data types. Example of using basic mode This example shows how to create a chart in basic mode. Step 1: Select the source of the data for a chart Begin by specifying what data you want to view in your chart. Click in the View a chart with box to select the event type, an attribute, and a function to perform on the attribute. You can use the event data dictionary to view information about an event type and its attributes on a single page. To see a tooltip with information about an event or attribute, hover over any term that has a dotted line underneath it. Here are the results of using the event data dictionary to specify the data: Event type. The Transaction event type measures a variety of data that describes what happens while a user is on a website, such as that user clicking on a button on a page. Attribute. The name attribute stores information on all transactions. Function. Select the unique_count function to get a count of all the transactions that occurred during the time frame. Basic mode now shows the selection: one.newrelic.com > Query builder > Basic > (event and attribute specified) As you specify data, the chart updates to show you the results from the data you specified. Based on the information specified so far, you can see a chart that shows the total number of transactions during the default time frame of 30 minutes. This total includes all transactions, whether the transaction was completed successfully or had errors. one.newrelic.com > Query builder > Basic > (event and attribute specified) Step 2: Filter the data Your next step is to determine which of those transactions got a 404 page not found error. If you look in the data dictionary for the Transaction event, you'll find this event also includes an attribute called httpResponseCode. Narrow the results to show only those transactions where a page not found error occurred. Use the Narrow results to box to create this filter: httpResponseCode = 404 . Because you want to be able to see the names of the apps that are resulting in the 404 errors, you use the Facet by box to see the results by appName (which is also an attribute for the Transaction event type). Faceting by appName updates the chart to break down the total number of 404 errors by the application names. This lets you know which apps are experiencing 404 errors. Your chart now shows the line chart with a line for each app, each with its own color. one.newrelic.com > Query builder > Basic > (event and attribute specified) > (filters and facets applied) Step 3: Adjust time range and limits You decide to focus on the five apps with the most page not found errors. The default value for the Limit field is 10, meaning that your chart will show the ten most relevant returns. You change that value to 5. Customer support told you that they had been getting calls about these errors for a little over two hours. You decide to change the time range from the last 30 minutes to the last three hours so that you can view the errors during the time when the customers were calling support. Now that you have the data set so that you are seeing exactly what you need, you can turn your attention to the appearance of the chart. Step 4: Customize the chart Because you are more interested in the total number of errors than a timeline view, you change the chart type to a bar chart. one.newrelic.com > Query builder > Basic > (event and attribute specified) > (filters and facets applied) > (time range and limit customized) > (chart type customized) When you're finished with your chart, you can add it to a dashboard or share it. This table contains notes about using basic mode. Item Description Prompts You can start typing directly in an empty box; a list of items that match the information you type will display. You can also click on an empty box to view a list of all of the items that are appropriate for the field, based on your earlier choices. Saving a basic mode data specification Every time you run a query, that query is saved in the My recent queries dropdown in advanced (NRQL) mode. Events Basic mode only supports data for one event and attribute. If you want to use more than one event and/or attribute, use the SELECT statement in advanced (NRQL) mode. Shortcuts Basic mode contains shortcuts that can display more complex events and attributes that aren't generally supported, as in this example (which shows the tooltip for the shortcut). Example of the Response time histogram shortcut, showing a tooltip. Tooltips Any time you see a dotted line under a term, you can hover over that term to see a tooltip with an explanation of the term. Narrow by You can use more than one Narrow by definition in basic mode filter; the conditions will be joined by AND. The WHERE clause in advanced (NRQL) allows OR in addition to AND. Important If your query was started using basic mode and if you make changes to that query using advanced (NRQL) mode, you cannot return to basic mode to edit that query. Any additional changes may only be made in advanced (NRQL) mode.",

Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABLE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "Use the New Relic One query builder in basic mode to create a chart without having to use NRQL, our querying language. The basic mode helps guides you through a query-creation process. You can choose the source of the raw data, apply filters, and use other techniques to narrow the scope of the data in the chart. Important As of September 1, 2021, we are discontinuing support of the query builder's basic mode. Instead, you can use our data explorer's user-friendly and intuitive functionality in New Relic One. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Data type The query builder basic mode has a Data type selector with two options: Events: In this context, this refers to all our non-Metric-type data, including events, logs, and trace data. Metrics: This refers to our dimensional Metric data type. You can also use this to query some types of metric timeslice data. For more on other types of metrics, see Data types. Example of using basic mode This example shows how to create a chart in basic mode. Step 1: Select the source of the data for a chart Begin by specifying what data you want to view in your chart. Click in the View a chart with box to select the event type, an attribute, and a function to perform on the attribute. You can use the event data dictionary to view information about an event type and its attributes on a single page. To see a tooltip with information about an event or attribute, hover over any term that has a dotted line underneath it. Here are the results of using the event data dictionary to specify the data: Event type. The Transaction event type measures a variety of data that describes what happens while a user is on a website, such as that user clicking on a button on a page. Attribute. The name attribute stores information on all transactions. Function. Select the unique_count function to get a count of all the transactions that occurred during the time frame. Basic mode now shows the selection: one.newrelic.com > Query builder > Basic > (event and attribute specified) As you specify data, the chart updates to show you the results from the data you specified. Based on the information specified so far, you can see a chart that shows the total number of transactions during the default time frame of 30 minutes. This total includes all transactions, whether the transaction was completed successfully or had errors. one.newrelic.com > Query builder > Basic > (event and attribute specified) Step 2: Filter the data Your next step is to determine which of those transactions got a 404 page not found error. If you look in the data dictionary for the Transaction event, you'll find this event also includes an attribute called httpResponseCode. Narrow the results to show only those transactions where a page not found error occurred. Use the Narrow results to box to create this filter: httpResponseCode = 404 . Because you want to be able to see the names of the apps that are resulting in the 404 errors, you use the Facet by box to see the results by appName (which is also an attribute for the Transaction event type). Faceting by appName updates the chart to break down the total number of 404 errors by the application names. This lets you know which apps are experiencing 404 errors. Your chart now shows the line chart with a line for each app, each with its own color. one.newrelic.com > Query builder > Basic > (event and attribute specified) > (filters and facets applied) Step 3: Adjust time range and limits You decide to focus on the five apps with the most page not found errors. The default value for the Limit field is 10, meaning that your chart will show the ten most relevant returns. You change that value to 5. Customer support told you that they had been getting calls about these errors for a little over two hours. You decide to change the time range from the last 30 minutes to the last three hours so that you can view the errors during the time when the customers were calling support. Now that you have the data set so that you are seeing exactly what you need, you can turn your attention to the appearance of the chart. Step 4: Customize the chart Because you are more interested in the total number of errors than a timeline view, you change the chart type to a bar chart. one.newrelic.com > Query builder > Basic > (event and attribute specified) > (filters and facets applied) > (time range and limit customized) > (chart type customized) When you're finished with your chart, you can add it to a dashboard or share it. This table contains notes about using basic mode. Item Description Prompts You can start typing directly in an empty box; a list of items that match the information you type will display. You can also click on an empty box to view a list of all of the items that are appropriate for the field, based on your earlier choices. Saving a basic mode data specification Every time you run a query, that query is saved in the My recent queries dropdown in advanced (NRQL) mode. Events Basic mode only supports data for one event and attribute. If you want to use more than one event and/or attribute, use the SELECT statement in advanced (NRQL) mode. Shortcuts Basic mode contains shortcuts that can display more complex events and attributes that aren't generally supported, as in this example (which shows the tooltip for the shortcut). Example of the Response time histogram shortcut, showing a tooltip. Tooltips Any time you see a dotted line under a term, you can hover over that term to see a tooltip with an explanation of the term. Narrow by You can use more than one Narrow by definition in basic mode filter; the conditions will be joined by AND. The WHERE clause in advanced (NRQL) allows OR in addition to AND. Important If your query was started using basic mode and if you make changes to that query using advanced (NRQL) mode, you cannot return to basic mode to edit that query. Any additional changes may only be made in advanced (NRQL) mode.",

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABLE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "Use the New Relic One query builder in basic mode to create a chart without having to use NRQL, our querying language. The basic mode helps guides you through a query-creation process. You can choose the source of the raw data, apply filters, and use other techniques to narrow the scope of the data in the chart. Important As of September 1, 2021, we are discontinuing support of the query builder's basic mode. Instead, you can use our data explorer's user-friendly and intuitive functionality in New Relic One. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Data type The query builder basic mode has a Data type selector with two options: Events: In this context, this refers to all our non-Metric-type data, including events, logs, and trace data. Metrics: This refers to our dimensional Metric data type. You can also use this to query some types of metric timeslice data. For more on other types of metrics, see Data types. Example of using basic mode This example shows how to create a chart in basic mode. Step 1: Select the source of the data for a chart Begin by specifying what data you want to view in your chart. Click in the View a chart with box to select the event type, an attribute, and a function to perform on the attribute. You can use the event data dictionary to view information about an event type and its attributes on a single page. To see a tooltip with information about an event or attribute, hover over any term that has a dotted line underneath it. Here are the results of using the event data dictionary to specify the data: Event type. The Transaction event type measures a variety of data that describes what happens while a user is on a website, such as that user clicking on a button on a page. Attribute. The name attribute stores information on all transactions. Function. Select the unique_count function to get a count of all the transactions that occurred during the time frame. Basic mode now shows the selection: one.newrelic.com > Query builder > Basic > (event and attribute specified) As you specify data, the chart updates to show you the results from the data you specified. Based on the information specified so far, you can see a chart that shows the total number of transactions during the default time frame of 30 minutes. This total includes all transactions, whether the transaction was completed successfully or had errors. one.newrelic.com > Query builder > Basic > (event and attribute specified) Step 2: Filter the data Your next step is to determine which of those transactions got a 404 page not found error. If you look in the data dictionary for the Transaction event, you'll find this event also includes an attribute called httpResponseCode. Narrow the results to show only those transactions where a page not found error occurred. Use the Narrow results to box to create this filter: httpResponseCode = 404 . Because you want to be able to see the names of the apps that are resulting in the 404 errors, you use the Facet by box to see the results by appName (which is also an attribute for the Transaction event type). Faceting by appName updates the chart to break down the total number of 404 errors by the application names. This lets you know which apps are experiencing 404 errors. Your chart now shows the line chart with a line for each app, each with its own color. one.newrelic.com > Query builder > Basic > (event and attribute specified) > (filters and facets applied) Step 3: Adjust time range and limits You decide to focus on the five apps with the most page not found errors. The default value for the Limit field is 10, meaning that your chart will show the ten most relevant returns. You change that value to 5. Customer support told you that they had been getting calls about these errors for a little over two hours. You decide to change the time range from the last 30 minutes to the last three hours so that you can view the errors during the time when the customers were calling support. Now that you have the data set so that you are seeing exactly what you need, you can turn your attention to the appearance of the chart. Step 4: Customize the chart Because you are more interested in the total number of errors than a timeline view, you change the chart type to a bar chart. one.newrelic.com > Query builder > Basic > (event and attribute specified) > (filters and facets applied) > (time range and limit customized) > (chart type customized) When you're finished with your chart, you can add it to a dashboard or share it. This table contains notes about using basic mode. Item Description Prompts You can start typing directly in an empty box; a list of items that match the information you type will display. You can also click on an empty box to view a list of all of the items that are appropriate for the field, based on your earlier choices. Saving a basic mode data specification Every time you run a query, that query is saved in the My recent queries dropdown in advanced (NRQL) mode. Events Basic mode only supports data for one event and attribute. If you want to use more than one event and/or attribute, use the SELECT statement in advanced (NRQL) mode. Shortcuts Basic mode contains shortcuts that can display more complex events and attributes that aren't generally supported, as in this example (which shows the tooltip for the shortcut). Example of the Response time histogram shortcut, showing a tooltip. Tooltips Any time you see a dotted line under a term, you can hover over that term to see a tooltip with an explanation of the term. Narrow by You can use more than one Narrow by definition in basic mode filter; the conditions will be joined by AND. The WHERE clause in advanced (NRQL) allows OR in addition to AND. Important If your query was started using basic mode and if you make changes to that query using advanced (NRQL) mode, you cannot return to basic mode to edit that query. Any additional changes may only be made in advanced (NRQL) mode.",

      "body": "With real time streaming, your APM event data is sent to New Relic every five seconds. You can query and visualize your data for transactions, errors, and custom events in near real time. The smaller payloads result in faster chart refreshes and faster queries of data that is the most important to you. No configuration is needed to take advantage of real time streaming. All you need to do is ensure your APM agent version is up to date. Why it matters Real time streaming doesn't result in more events being sent. The combination of more frequent posts, with a smaller number of events per post, results in approximately the same number of events per minute as there would be without real time streaming. The following image shows a comparison between data sent to New Relic with and without real time streaming. Note that 10,000 is an example number of events; some agents have lower default limits. The overall limits on how many events can be sent per minute haven't changed. Also, non-event data (spans, traces, and metrics) are unaffected; they're still sent every minute. Use real time streaming to quickly understand the impact when something has changed, such as deploying a new app version. Examine key performance indicators (throughput, error rates, charting, etc.) in near real time. Respond quickly to failure conditions and anomalies. Get the most out of New Relic One dashboards. Reduce mean time to detection with APM events reporting every five seconds. Agent version to automatically enable To enable real time streaming, update to the latest APM agent. You don't need to configure anything to enable real time streaming; it will automatically report faster! Real time streaming is supported by all APM agents. Here are the minimum agent versions: C SDK: v1.3.0 or higher Go: v2.8.0 or higher Java: v5.5.0 or higher .NET: v8.23.107.0 or higher Node.js: v5.13.0 or higher PHP: v9.5.0.252 or higher Python: v5.2.0.127 or higher Ruby: v6.7.0.359 or higher Caution If Transaction event reporting is disabled, this can affect some UI elements throughout New Relic. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data. Query real time streaming data When building charts, include the following in your NRQL query: NRQL clause Comments SINCE 5 minutes ago Be sure to add a SINCE 5 minutes ago clause to your NRQL query in order to take advantage of the 5 second chart refresh interval. This is because the chart's refresh interval is based on the time window. TIMESERIES bucket To set the refresh interval for time series charts, you can also specify the bucket size as an optional argument to the TIMESERIES clause. For example, SINCE 30 minutes ago TIMESERIES 5 seconds will display a 30 minute window at a 5 second resolution. You can have a maximum of 366 buckets. Create real time streaming charts You can visualize the results of your NRQL query in New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com, and at the top of the page, select Query your data. Use the data explorer to start building a chart. Select the advanced (NRQL) mode to refine your query. In your NRQL query, adjust the SINCE and TIMESERIES clauses to take advantage of the 5 second refresh intervals.",

      "body": "Usage import { Dropdown } from 'nr1' Copy Examples Props ariaLabelstring Provide a descriptive label for this control, e.g. \"Accounts\". childrenrequirednode|function This component can render either declaratively, by directly passing a set of children or virtualized, by passing a render callback (function as children). Children can be of two types: <DropdownItem>s, to generate items; or <DropdownSection>s, when the dropdown is sectioned. Each section can, in turn, have <DropdownItem>s in it. The recommendation is to use the render callback when a large number of items is provided, since the item list will be virtualized by the component, thus increasing the performance. When using the render callback, items need to be provided through the items prop. Then, the callback will be called for each item present in the array, and the expected result is a <DropdownItem> or a <DropdownSection> depending on the sectioned prop. classNamestring Appends class names to the component. Should be used only for positioning and spacing purposes. descriptionstring Message with instructions on how to fill the form field. disabledboolean If true, the dropdown is not available for

infostring Additional information can be displayed in an info tooltip next to the Label. invalidboolean|string When true, sets the field in an invalid state, in order to notify the user attention is needed over this particular field. This property can be a boolean field or a string. When it is a string, as well as the invalid state being shown, the text will be shown below. itemsarray Items to render, in the shape of a list of objects. Usually, each item in the items array contains the required data to generate the corresponding <DropdownItem> (or <DropdownSection> in case the dropdown is sectioned). This prop is required when rendering items with the render callback (function as children). labelstring Text to display as label. labelInlineboolean Display the label inline the form control. Use only when the component is not inside a Form. In that case set layoutType to Form.LAYOUT_TYPE.SPLIT in the Form component. loadingboolean DEFAULT false To indicate whether an action is in progress, especially in the case that it takes more than 1 second to complete, you should display the loading state. onClosefunction Callback fired any time the dropdown is closed. function ( event : React.MouseEvent ) onLoadMorefunction Callback fired when more items must be loaded. This happens when you're lazy loading the items and the items that are about to render cannot be found in the items array. This callback should be used to fetch/load the missing items from the backend or other sources. The returned Promise should be resolved once item data has finished loading. It will be used to determine when to refresh the list with the newly-loaded data. This callback may be called multiple times in reaction to a single scroll event. function ( cursor : Cursor Items to load. ) onOpenfunction Callback fired any time the dropdown is opened. function ( event : React.MouseEvent ) onSearchfunction Callback fired any time the search input of the dropdown changes. This callback needs the search prop to be defined. function ( event : React.ChangeEvent ) onTogglefunction Callback fired any time the dropdown is toggled. function ( event : React.MouseEvent, opened : boolean ) placementTypeenum DEFAULT Dropdown . PLACEMENT_TYPE . BOTTOM_START Specifies the placement of the dropdown relative to the dropdown trigger. Default display is on the bottom start, but you can also choose to display it from the bottom end. <One of Dropdown.PLACEMENT_TYPE.BOTTOM_END , Dropdown.PLACEMENT_TYPE.BOTTOM_START , > requiredboolean DEFAULT false If true, denotes the form field as required. rowCountnumber Number of rows. By default it's equal to length of array passed in the items prop. You should specify the rowCount when you know the total number of items but you want to lazy load them while scrolling. searchstring Value of the search input. The search input will be shown only if the value is defined. sectionedboolean DEFAULT false Establishes whether the dropdown is sectioned. A sectioned dropdown composes its options grouped by sections (made with <DropdownSection>), where each section is delimited by an optional title at the top, and a horizontal separator at the bottom. spacingTypeenum[] Spacing property. Spacing is defined as a tuple of zero to four values, which follow the same conventions as CSS properties like margin or padding. To omit a value, use SPACING_TYPE.OMIT. <Array of <One of Dropdown.SPACING_TYPE.EXTRA_LARGE , Dropdown.SPACING_TYPE.LARGE , Dropdown.SPACING_TYPE.MEDIUM , Dropdown.SPACING_TYPE.NONE , Dropdown.SPACING_TYPE.OMIT , Dropdown.SPACING_TYPE.SMALL , > > styleobject Inline style for custom styling. Should be used only for positioning and spacing purposes. testIdstring Adds a data-test-id attribute. Use it to target the component in unit and E2E tests. For a test id to be valid, prefix it with your nerdpack id, followed up by a dot. For example, my-nerdpack.some-element. Note: You might not see data-test-id attributes as they are removed from the DOM, to debug them pass a e2e-test query parameter to the URL. titlestring DEFAULT \"\" The text to display in the dropdown button. When not present, an icon must be passed instead. typeenum DEFAULT Dropdown . TYPE . NORMAL Type can be: Primary — use to call attention to one specific action you want the user to take as a next step. Normal (used as secondary) — use when multiple actions need to be displayed. Plain — use when multiple actions need to be available that are less important for the user to take. Destructive — use when you have a destructive action like delete or remove, which you would like the user to pause and consider before completing. <One of Dropdown.TYPE.DESTRUCTIVE , Dropdown.TYPE.NORMAL , Dropdown.TYPE.PLAIN , Dropdown.TYPE.PLAIN_NEUTRAL , Dropdown.TYPE.PRIMARY , > Type definitions DropdownRendererArguments { item : string, Item to render index : number, Index of the item in the items array items : string[], Array of items which we're iterating on } Cursor { startIndex : number, First index of the range of items to load. stopIndex : number, Last index of the range of items to load. }",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you built a custom visualization that shows queried data in one of two chart types: RadarChart Treemap You used a SegmentedControl to switch between the two chart types in the visualization UI. This implementation takes up space in the visualization, but it offers your users the choice to switch between two chart types even after you've created an instance of your chart. But what if you only need to be able to select an option once, when initializing the visualization? In this lesson you'll learn how to add a configuration option to your visualization which replaces the SegmentedControl. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Add a new configuration option Step 1 of 8 In your visualization's nr1.json file, add an enum configuration object for selectedChart: index.js nr1.json 1 import React from 'react'; 2 import PropTypes from 'prop-types'; 3 import { 4 Radar, 5 RadarChart, 6 PolarGrid, 7 PolarAngleAxis, 8 PolarRadiusAxis, 9 Treemap, 10 } from 'recharts'; 11 import { 12 AutoSizer, 13 Card, 14 CardBody, 15 HeadingText, 16 NrqlQuery, 17 SegmentedControl, 18 SegmentedControlItem, 19 Spinner, 20 } from 'nr1'; 21 22 const CHART_TYPES = { 23 Radar: 'radar', 24 Treemap: 'treemap', 25 }; 26 27 export default class RadarOrTreemapVisualization extends React.Component { 28 // Custom props you wish to be configurable in the UI must also be defined in 29 // the nr1.json file for the visualization.

Step 3 of 8 Serve your Nerdpack locally: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve If you're still serving your Nerdpack from the last lesson, you need to stop it with CTRL-X and serve it again to reflect changes to nr1.json. Step 4 of 8 Go to https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local. The nerdpacks=local query string directs the UI to load your visualization from the local server.

      "body": "Once you've created a chart, you can customize the appearance of it to best present the data. You can share a chart in different formats and add a chart to a new or existing dashboard. Change the appearance of your chart When you run your query in advanced (NRQL) mode or view your chart while using the data explorer to specify data, the query builder analyzes your data and applies a chart type that fits your data. For some queries, you'll have several options of chart types to choose from. To change chart type, use the Chart type menu to the right of the current chart. Each type in the list has a tooltip with information about using that type. Example of the chart type menu, showing a tooltip. Customize your charts While we try our best to optimize how we display your data, sometimes you may have other needs. To this end, you can customize charts to display information at your convenience. Tip Customizations are available depending on the chart type. Format date and time Tip For table and billboard charts. Customize the date and time format for tables and billboards: for each type of data, you can select if you want to leave it as it is, or modify the format as Numeric or Date. If data is a timestamp, you can choose how to represent the date and time: For numbers, select if you want us to auto-format them, or chose the number of decimals you want to see. Customize the Y axis Tip For line and area charts. On line charts and area charts you can adjust the Y axis to display the data within certain values by setting a minimum and maximum value for the axis. If no customization option is selected, dashboards automatically displays the full Y axis from 0 to the top value plus a margin. Enable or disable the legend Tip For line and area charts, and histograms. For line charts, area charts, and histograms, you can disable or enable the legend. Remove the other groups facet Tip For bar and pie charts, and tables. When faceting on bar charts, pie charts, or tables, and if the number of faceting on queries is larger than 2,000, the Other groups facet aggregates the rest of facets. With this customization you can select whether to see Other groups, or remove it. More chart-specific features For more chart type-specific features, see Chart types. Chart share and view options Most charts have various options, including a chart-embed option, getting a chart as an image, and adding a chart to a dashboard. To read about general chart options, see Basic UI features.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Use New Relic One custom visualizations to display your data, whether it's from New Relic's database or an external source, in unique ways that are distinct from the charts offered by the New Relic platform. In this lesson, you build a visualization that displays your data in one of two chart types: RadarChart or Treemap. You then implement a SegmentedControl component from the New Relic One SDK, which allows you to alternate between the two chart types. Ultimately, this gives you freedom to view your data in a dynamic way that isn't possible with New Relic's base offerings. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Before you begin Explore our custom visualization guides and build your first visualization. After you're done, you'll have a better foundation for building more complex visualizations, such as the one you'll build in this course. Finally, if you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the steps in the nr1 quick start to install and configure the CLI Create your visualization Step 1 of 2 Ensure you're working with the latest version of the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 2 Create a visualization, called radar-or-treemap, in a Nerdpack, called alternate-viz: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name radar-or-treemap ✔ You’re trying to create a visualization outside of a Nerdpack. We’ll create a Nerdpack for you—what do you want to name it? … alternate-viz ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack alternate-viz is available at \"./alternate-viz\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization radar-or-treemap is available at \"./alternate-viz/visualizations/radar-or-treemap\" Tip If you receive a RequestError for a self-signed certificate when you run nr1 create, you may need to add a certificate to Node's certificate chain. Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/radar-or-treemap directory under alternate-viz: bash Copy $ cd alternate-viz $ ls visualizations/radar-or-treemap index.js nr1.json styles.scss Set up your component state Add component state to the default visualization template that nr1 created for you.

Now that you've created an object which enumerates the chart type options for your visualization, and you've initialized state.selectedChart, you're ready to implement a control UI for switching between the two chart types. Add SegmentedControl components state.selectedChart isn't useful unless your visualization's users can actually select a chart type.

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABLE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), percentile(), average() or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute, and you can use the OR operator to facet results that don't match any of your specified cases. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy Facet non-matching data with OR This example uses the OR operator to facet results that didn't match any of your cases: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') OR name Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE r'z.*|q.*'' hostname RLIKE r'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' z-app q-app ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions In this section we explain NRQL functions, both aggregator functions and non-aggregator functions. Aggregator functions You can use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data. Some tips for using these: See New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. If you're using an aggregator function multiple times in the same query (for example, SELECT median(one_metric), median(another_metric)), it can cause problems in displaying results. To solve this, use the AS function. For example: `SELECT median(one_metric) as 'med-a', median(another_metric) as 'med-b'` Copy Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. For how to display results over time, see Group results over time. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in the same unit of time as the chosen attribute. For instance, if the attribute is measured in seconds, t will be a threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (that is, seconds 0 to 59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy capture(attribute, regular expression) Use the capture() to extract values from an attribute using a regular expression. Uses RE2 syntax. It takes two arguments: Attribute name Regular expression with capture syntax. Regex expressions in NRQL use Python-like syntax, r'...'. When capturing, use the RE2 named-capture syntax ...(?P<name> pattern )... to capture the contained pattern, given the specified name. Currently, only 1 capture group is supported. Please see the examples below. capture() within a SELECT clause condition The following will select the domain name of the website, removing https:// and any paths following the .com SELECT capture(pageUrl, r'https://(?P<baseUrl>.*.com)/.+') FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The following will capture only the first word of the error message. SELECT capture(errorMessage, r'(?P<firstWord>\\S+)\\s.+') FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago where errorMessage is not null Copy capture() within a FACET clause condition The following will facet by the captured HTTP method. SELECT count(*) FROM Log WHERE message like '%HTTP%' FACET capture(message, r'.* \"(?P<httpMethod>[A-Z]+) .*') Copy capture() within a WHERE clause condition The following will filter the results based on Log events with message attribute that matches the regular expression where the captured job name is ExampleJob. SELECT message FROM Log WHERE capture(message, r'.*Job Failed: (?P<jobName>[A-Za-z]+),.*') = 'ExampleJob' SINCE 10 minutes ago Copy capture() with a numeric cast The following will capture sum of CPU Time from log lines. You must explicitly cast to numeric to do mathematical operations. SELECT sum(numeric(capture(message, r'.*CpuTime:\\s(?P<cpuTime>\\d+)'))) FROM Log WHERE message like '%CpuTime:%' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "NRQL supports the use of basic and advanced mathematical operators within a SELECT clause. You can apply mathematical calculations on both individual attributes and also the results of aggregator functions. Use basic math operators with SELECT To use basic math functions in NRQL, include operators within the SELECT clause: Addition: + Subtraction: - Multiplication: * Division: / Here are some examples: SELECT duration-databaseDuration FROM Transaction Copy SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) FROM PageView Copy SELECT average(duration-databaseDuration) FROM Transaction Copy Use advanced math operators with SELECT NRQL also includes some advanced mathematical capabilities that can be used for complex calculations. This is helpful if you want to process data to display it more effectively in the UI, or make statistical or psychometric calculations on queried results in a single step. abs abs(n) returns the absolute value of n. For non-negative n it returns n, and for negative n it returns the positive number -n. For example abs(2) = 2, and abs(-4) = 4. clamp_max, clamp_min The clamping functions impose an upper or lower bound on values. For example, clamp_max(duration, 10) returns the duration, unless it exceeds 10, in which case 10 is returned. Similarly clamp_min(duration, 1) will not return any value lower than 1. The following chart shows the result of clamping both min and max to keep the value in the range 70-90. Sample graph showing raw data with clamp function applied. exp Computes the natural exponential function of the argument: exp(n) = pow(e, n). Logarithmic functions: ln, log, log2, log10 These functions compute the logarithm of the argument for various bases. ln(n) computes the natural logarithm: the logarithm base e. log2(n) computes the logarithm base 2. log10(n) computes the logarithm base 10. log(n, b) allows logarithms to be computed with an arbitrary base b. All logarithms satisfy the identity: log(pow(b, n), b) = n. Note that log(0) is undefined, for all bases. Be aware that if you take the logarithm of something that might be zero, you may end up getting no value back from your query. pow pow(n, m) computes n raised to the power m. (I.e. n * n * ... * n, with m copies of n) abs(n) returns the absolute value of n. For non-negative n it returns n, and for negative n it returns the positive number -n. For example abs(2) = 2 and abs(-4) = 4. Rounding functions: round, floor, ceil These three functions force decimal numbers to one of the neighboring integers. floor(n) returns the closest integer less than or equal to n. ceil(n) (short for \"ceiling\") returns the closest integer greater than or equal to n. round(n) returns the closest integer to n in either direction. Sample graph showing raw data, with floor, round, and ceiling functions applied. sqrt sqrt(n) returns the square root of n, that is, the number such that sqrt(n) * sqrt(n) = n. Results with STRING or FLOAT Here is how NRQL handles strings present in math calculations: pow(n, m) computes n raised to the power m. (for example, n * n * ... * n, with m copies of n) Examples: sum(1+STRING) = 0 sum(1+MIXED) = skips records where MIXED is a string average(1+STRING) = 0 average(1+MIXED) = skips records where MIXED is a string NULL and zero both appear as 0 in the dashboard. To override NULL values with another numeric value, use the syntax: SELECT average(purchasePrice OR 0) Copy This will replace NULL values with 0 or any number specified. Tip This can also be used to test whether something returns NULL or zero. (zero) OR 1 returns 0. (NULL) OR 1 returns 1.",

      "body": "BETA FEATURE This feature is currently in beta. Dimensional metrics are an industry standard for storing and querying metric data. All infrastructure metrics are stored as event data in New Relic, but you can also query them through dimensional metrics. In this page you can learn: The benefits of dimensional metrics. A few examples on how and where to use them. Known issues. Why it matters At New Relic we report metrics in several ways, including dimensional metrics, which are used by our metric API, Telemetry SDK, some open-source integrations, and our infrastructure services. This type of metric enables you to: Enjoy an improved query experience for Infrastructure data. Discover all your metrics in one place. Tap into more metric sources, such as Prometheus. For example, the query to get the maximum duration of your Lambda functions is simplified: Query with samples FROM ServerlessSample SELECT max(provider.duration.Maximum) WHERE provider = 'LambdaFunction' Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(aws.lambda.function.duration) Copy Get started No agent or integration updates are required to use these metrics. NRQL alerting based on dimensional metrics is also supported, except for data coming from cloud integrations (that is metrics from AWS polling integrations, GCP, and Azure). AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams metrics are ingested as dimensional metrics and NRQL alerts are recommended. Where and how to query dimensional metrics All current NRQL query features are supported. Queries can use WHERE, FACET, and time selection functions such as SINCE, UNTIL, and COMPARE WITH. The query builder in New Relic One supports metrics in both simple and advanced (NRQL) mode. Naming conventions for metrics and attributes All metric names and attributes for dimensional metrics follow the same naming convention in order to make them easy to find and use. Metric and attribute names are namespaced with dots: for example, the host. prefix is used for host metrics, the k8s. prefix is used for Kubernetes metrics, and aws. is used for AWS metrics. The graphic below shows how a ProcessSample that contains three metrics (cpuPercent, ioTotalReadBytes, and ioTotalWriteBytes) is split into three separate metrics. Note the updated naming of the metrics and the attributes. Dimensional metrics naming convention Examples Here are some examples of NQRL queries with and without dimensional metrics: AWS EBS query example Get the total write time by EBS Volume. Query with samples FROM BlockDeviceSample SELECT sum('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' FACET entityName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(aws.ebs.volume.TotalWriteTime) FACET entity.name Copy Azure Service bus query example Maximum number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic by resource group.

      "body": "NRQL is a query language you can use to query the New Relic database. This document explains NRQL syntax, clauses, components, and functions. Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), percentile(), average() or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute, and you can use the OR operator to facet results that don't match any of your specified cases. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy Facet non-matching data with OR This example uses the OR operator to facet results that didn't match any of your cases: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') OR name Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE r'z.*|q.*'' hostname RLIKE r'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' z-app q-app ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions In this section we explain NRQL functions, both aggregator functions and non-aggregator functions. Aggregator functions You can use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data. Some tips for using these: See New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. If you're using an aggregator function multiple times in the same query (for example, SELECT median(one_metric), median(another_metric)), it can cause problems in displaying results. To solve this, use the AS function. For example: `SELECT median(one_metric) as 'med-a', median(another_metric) as 'med-b'` Copy Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. For how to display results over time, see Group results over time. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in the same unit of time as the chosen attribute. For instance, if the attribute is measured in seconds, t will be a threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (that is, seconds 0 to 59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy capture(attribute, regular expression) Use the capture() to extract values from an attribute using a regular expression. Uses RE2 syntax. It takes two arguments: Attribute name Regular expression with capture syntax. Regex expressions in NRQL use Python-like syntax, r'...'. When capturing, use the RE2 named-capture syntax ...(?P<name> pattern )... to capture the contained pattern, given the specified name. Currently, only 1 capture group is supported. Please see the examples below. capture() within a SELECT clause condition The following will select the domain name of the website, removing https:// and any paths following the .com SELECT capture(pageUrl, r'https://(?P<baseUrl>.*.com)/.+') FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The following will capture only the first word of the error message. SELECT capture(errorMessage, r'(?P<firstWord>\\S+)\\s.+') FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago where errorMessage is not null Copy capture() within a FACET clause condition The following will facet by the captured HTTP method. SELECT count(*) FROM Log WHERE message like '%HTTP%' FACET capture(message, r'.* \"(?P<httpMethod>[A-Z]+) .*') Copy capture() within a WHERE clause condition The following will filter the results based on Log events with message attribute that matches the regular expression where the captured job name is ExampleJob. SELECT message FROM Log WHERE capture(message, r'.*Job Failed: (?P<jobName>[A-Za-z]+),.*') = 'ExampleJob' SINCE 10 minutes ago Copy capture() with a numeric cast The following will capture sum of CPU Time from log lines. You must explicitly cast to numeric to do mathematical operations. SELECT sum(numeric(capture(message, r'.*CpuTime:\\s(?P<cpuTime>\\d+)'))) FROM Log WHERE message like '%CpuTime:%' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. Ready to get started? If you haven't already, be sure to sign up for a New Relic account. It's free, forever. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by APM, browser, and mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the data explorer. Learn more about querying data in New Relic. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data from browser monitoring. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for browser monitoring PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

All infrastructure metrics are stored as event data in New Relic, but you can also query them through dimensional metrics. In this page you can learn: The benefits of dimensional metrics. A few examples on how and where to use them. Known issues. Why it matters At New Relic we report metrics in several ways, including dimensional metrics, which are used by our metric API, Telemetry SDK, some open-source integrations, and our infrastructure services. This type of metric enables you to: Enjoy an improved query experience for Infrastructure data. Discover all your metrics in one place. Tap into more metric sources, such as Prometheus. For example, the query to get the maximum duration of your Lambda functions is simplified: Query with samples FROM ServerlessSample SELECT max(provider.duration.Maximum) WHERE provider = 'LambdaFunction' Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(aws.lambda.function.duration) Copy Get started No agent or integration updates are required to use these metrics. NRQL alerting based on dimensional metrics is also supported, except for data coming from cloud integrations (that is metrics from AWS polling integrations, GCP, and Azure). AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams metrics are ingested as dimensional metrics and NRQL alerts are recommended. Where and how to query dimensional metrics All current NRQL query features are supported. Queries can use WHERE, FACET, and time selection functions such as SINCE, UNTIL, and COMPARE WITH. The query builder in New Relic One supports metrics in both simple and advanced (NRQL) mode. Naming conventions for metrics and attributes All metric names and attributes for dimensional metrics follow the same naming convention in order to make them easy to find and use. Metric and attribute names are namespaced with dots: for example, the host. prefix is used for host metrics, the k8s. prefix is used for Kubernetes metrics, and aws. is used for AWS metrics. The graphic below shows how a ProcessSample that contains three metrics (cpuPercent, ioTotalReadBytes, and ioTotalWriteBytes) is split into three separate metrics. Note the updated naming of the metrics and the attributes. Dimensional metrics naming convention Examples Here are some examples of NQRL queries with and without dimensional metrics: AWS EBS query example Get the total write time by EBS Volume. Query with samples FROM BlockDeviceSample SELECT sum('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' FACET entityName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(aws.ebs.volume.TotalWriteTime) FACET entity.name Copy Azure Service bus query example Maximum number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic by resource group. Query with samples FROM AzureServiceBusTopicSample SELECT max(activeMessages.Maximum) FACET resourceGroupName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(azure.servicebus.topic.activeMessages) FACET azure.resourceGroup Copy Azure functions query example Number of function executions Azure Functions over the past 6 hours by region over time. Query with samples FROM AzureFunctionsAppSample SELECT sum(functionExecutionCount.Total) FACET regionName TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(azure.functions.app.functionExecutionCount) FACET azure.region TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Azure VMs query example Compare the number of Azure VMs over the past thirty minutes with the same time a week ago.

Query with samples FROM NginxSample SELECT average(net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy MySQL query example The maximum number of used MySQL connections. Query with samples FROM MysqlSample SELECT max(net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(mysql.node.net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Known limitations Metric queries with * do not return Infrastructure sample data (for example, SELECT * FROM Metric). In order to select attributes starting with tags. a metric name has to be provided. For example, SELECT uniques(tags.environment) FROM Metric WHERE metricName='aws.lambda.function.duration' does not work without the WHERE clause. Results may not be complete if the selection criteria matches too many samples. For example, SELECT uniqueCount(entity.guid) FROM Metric maps to all Infrastructure samples, and may return incomplete results.

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. Ready to get started? If you haven't already, be sure to sign up for a New Relic account. It's free, forever. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by APM, browser, and mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the data explorer. Learn more about querying data in New Relic. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data from browser monitoring. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for browser monitoring PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion.

      "body": "NRQL supports the use of basic and advanced mathematical operators within a SELECT clause. You can apply mathematical calculations on both individual attributes and also the results of aggregator functions. Use basic math operators with SELECT To use basic math functions in NRQL, include operators within the SELECT clause: Addition: + Subtraction: - Multiplication: * Division: / Here are some examples: SELECT duration-databaseDuration FROM Transaction Copy SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) FROM PageView Copy SELECT average(duration-databaseDuration) FROM Transaction Copy Use advanced math operators with SELECT NRQL also includes some advanced mathematical capabilities that can be used for complex calculations. This is helpful if you want to process data to display it more effectively in the UI, or make statistical or psychometric calculations on queried results in a single step. abs abs(n) returns the absolute value of n. For non-negative n it returns n, and for negative n it returns the positive number -n. For example abs(2) = 2, and abs(-4) = 4. clamp_max, clamp_min The clamping functions impose an upper or lower bound on values. For example, clamp_max(duration, 10) returns the duration, unless it exceeds 10, in which case 10 is returned. Similarly clamp_min(duration, 1) will not return any value lower than 1. The following chart shows the result of clamping both min and max to keep the value in the range 70-90. Sample graph showing raw data with clamp function applied. exp Computes the natural exponential function of the argument: exp(n) = pow(e, n). Logarithmic functions: ln, log, log2, log10 These functions compute the logarithm of the argument for various bases. ln(n) computes the natural logarithm: the logarithm base e. log2(n) computes the logarithm base 2. log10(n) computes the logarithm base 10. log(n, b) allows logarithms to be computed with an arbitrary base b. All logarithms satisfy the identity: log(pow(b, n), b) = n. Note that log(0) is undefined, for all bases. Be aware that if you take the logarithm of something that might be zero, you may end up getting no value back from your query. pow pow(n, m) computes n raised to the power m. (I.e. n * n * ... * n, with m copies of n) abs(n) returns the absolute value of n. For non-negative n it returns n, and for negative n it returns the positive number -n. For example abs(2) = 2 and abs(-4) = 4. Rounding functions: round, floor, ceil These three functions force decimal numbers to one of the neighboring integers. floor(n) returns the closest integer less than or equal to n. ceil(n) (short for \"ceiling\") returns the closest integer greater than or equal to n. round(n) returns the closest integer to n in either direction. Sample graph showing raw data, with floor, round, and ceiling functions applied. sqrt sqrt(n) returns the square root of n, that is, the number such that sqrt(n) * sqrt(n) = n. Results with STRING or FLOAT Here is how NRQL handles strings present in math calculations: pow(n, m) computes n raised to the power m. (for example, n * n * ... * n, with m copies of n) Examples: sum(1+STRING) = 0 sum(1+MIXED) = skips records where MIXED is a string average(1+STRING) = 0 average(1+MIXED) = skips records where MIXED is a string NULL and zero both appear as 0 in the dashboard. To override NULL values with another numeric value, use the syntax: SELECT average(purchasePrice OR 0) Copy This will replace NULL values with 0 or any number specified. Tip This can also be used to test whether something returns NULL or zero. (zero) OR 1 returns 0. (NULL) OR 1 returns 1.",

The graphic below shows how a ProcessSample that contains three metrics (cpuPercent, ioTotalReadBytes, and ioTotalWriteBytes) is split into three separate metrics. Note the updated naming of the metrics and the attributes. Dimensional metrics naming convention Examples Here are some examples of NQRL queries with and without dimensional metrics: AWS EBS query example Get the total write time by EBS Volume. Query with samples FROM BlockDeviceSample SELECT sum('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' FACET entityName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(aws.ebs.volume.TotalWriteTime) FACET entity.name Copy Azure Service bus query example Maximum number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic by resource group. Query with samples FROM AzureServiceBusTopicSample SELECT max(activeMessages.Maximum) FACET resourceGroupName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(azure.servicebus.topic.activeMessages) FACET azure.resourceGroup Copy Azure functions query example Number of function executions Azure Functions over the past 6 hours by region over time. Query with samples FROM AzureFunctionsAppSample SELECT sum(functionExecutionCount.Total) FACET regionName TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(azure.functions.app.functionExecutionCount) FACET azure.region TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Azure VMs query example Compare the number of Azure VMs over the past thirty minutes with the same time a week ago. Query with samples FROM AzureVirtualMachineScaleSetSample SELECT uniqueCount(vMName) FACET name SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT uniqueCount(azure.vms.vmName) FACET azure.resourceName WHERE azure.resourceType='Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets' SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Copy NGINX query example The average number of NGINX requests per second over time. Query with samples FROM NginxSample SELECT average(net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy MySQL query example The maximum number of used MySQL connections. Query with samples FROM MysqlSample SELECT max(net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(mysql.node.net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Known limitations Metric queries with * do not return Infrastructure sample data (for example, SELECT * FROM Metric). In order to select attributes starting with tags. a metric name has to be provided. For example, SELECT uniques(tags.environment) FROM Metric WHERE metricName='aws.lambda.function.duration' does not work without the WHERE clause. Results may not be complete if the selection criteria matches too many samples. For example, SELECT uniqueCount(entity.guid) FROM Metric maps to all Infrastructure samples, and may return incomplete results. Initially there is no support for the newly introduced metric wildcarding feature (for example, SELECT average(host.swap%Bytes) FROM Metric).",

      "body": "You can use the New Relic NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to make New Relic Query Language (NRQL) queries. To learn how to construct these queries and see responses, go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. This document explains some of the available functions for NRQL queries. NRQL queries made through NerdGraph are subject to NRQL Query Rate Limits. Basic NRQL queries with NerdGraph To make NRQL queries using NerdGraph: Go to the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Pass the NRQL query as a string argument to the NRQL object, and include the results field in your NerdGraph query. For example, to get a count of all transaction events in the last hour, use the following query: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 1 HOUR AGO\") { results } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns the following results: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \"results\": [ { \"count\": 1000 } ] } } } } } Copy The actual value of the count varies depending on your transaction data. Use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer to experiment with queries. Create embeddable charts In addition to returning raw data, you can fetch embeddable chart links for the data to use in an application. For example, instead of a single count of transaction, you can create a chart that illustrates a timeseries of bucketed counts over time. Add TIMESERIES to your query with embeddedChartUrl: { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) from Transaction TIMESERIES\") { embeddedChartUrl } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns the URL for the chart in the following response: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \" embeddedChartUrl \": \"https://chart-embed.service.newrelic.com/charts/EMBEDDABLE-CHART-ID\" } } } } } Copy If you view the embedded chart URL using any standard HTTP client, it returns an image showing a visualization of the response to the query you submitted. These charts follow the same embedded chart rules as embedded charts that are created elsewhere. To change the style of the data visualization, pass a chartType argument to embeddedChartUrl. Suggested facets When using NerdGraph to explore your data, you can use the suggestedFacets field to return suggested attributes for use in faceted NRQL queries. Rules governing suggested facets Here are some of the rules that govern what attributes are suggested: Built-in suggestions. Each event type comes with its own set of recommended attributes. These are attributes chosen by New Relic for their importance and popularity. Usage-based suggestions. Some attribute suggestions are based on the queries that have been frequently used by your account. These suggestions can include custom attributes. Role restriction. Restricted users do not have access to account-related facet suggestions. To disable the use of account data for determining suggested queries, contact Support. Example of returning suggested attributes Here's an example of returning suggested attributes for faceting transaction counts. The response suggests the host attribute. Faceting by host can reveal that one host is servicing more requests than other hosts. { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { nrql(query: \"SELECT count(*) from Transaction TIMESERIES\") { suggestedFacets { attributes } } } } } Copy This NerdGraph query example returns a response similar to this: { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"nrql\": { \" suggestedFacets \": [ \"attributes\": [\"host\"] ] } } } } } Copy",

Replace \"accountId\": 1, with your New Relic account ID for each occurrence in the JSON code. Copy the Dashboard JSON from your text editor and import using one of the methods described above. Edit any charts that you'd like to use facet filtering with. Tip If your private locations exist in a parent account and Synthetics monitors in a sub account, insert the parent account ID for NRQL queries that use SyntheticPrivateLocationStatus and SyntheticsPrivateMinion, and the sub account ID for queries that use SyntheticCheck and SyntheticRequest. Are my private minions online? To answer this question, you can rely on attributes from the SyntheticsPrivateMinionevent. Private minions send this event to New Relic every 30 seconds. A simple way to check if your minions are online is to compare the unique count of minion IDs with the number of minions you expect to be online. To understand how many minions are reporting, run this example NRQL query: SELECT uniqueCount(minionId) FROM SyntheticsPrivateMinion WHERE minionLocation = '1-acme_okc_dc-309' Copy Using this query, you can create an alert condition to notify your team when fewer minions are reporting than expected. This condition is configured with a static threshold of 2 units, which means you will receive an alert if any of your minions are offline. You can verify that the alert policy works as expected by manually stopping one of your minions. Then, when the alert violation occurs, you will be notified by any notification channels that have been set up. Once the minion is restarted and it comes back online, the alert will recover. There are more robust ways to check whether minions are functioning correctly, but this query and condition simply and successfully handle the case where a machine fails, is accidentally decommissioned, or the minion process crashes. It also ensures that the minion can communicate with New Relic. Does my private location need more minions? To answer this question, you can use the checksPending attribute of the SyntheticsPrivateLocationStatus event. The checksPending attribute reflects the number of monitor checks that are scheduled (or \"queued\") but have yet to be accepted by a minion in the designated location. For a location with scheduled checks and no minions, this graph would grow linearly up and to the right. This metric is more complicated to monitor than uniqueCount(minionId) because a high value does not necessarily mean the location is in a bad state. As long as the metric is not growing linearly up and to the right (and checks are being run on schedule), the location is in a good state. This use case is perfect for baseline NRQL alert conditions, which allow you to monitor the deviation of a metric rather than its static value. For example: SELECT average(checksPending) FROM SyntheticsPrivateLocationStatus WHERE name = '1-acme_tokyo_dc-512' Copy To test this alert condition, schedule one-minute, browser-based monitors to run from your location. Browser-based jobs consume more resources than ping jobs, which is why they are a better fit for load simulation. New Relic will quickly notify you of a growing number of pending checks. After doubling the number of minions to handle the load, the alert recovers. For example, using the Synthetics private location dashboard example, notice the growth and decline of pending checks over the course of the incident and recovery. By using the NRQL condition, New Relic will notify you if and when the location needs more minion capacity. Can I check the status of a specific minion directly? You can also check how a minion is operating by contacting it directly. You can use a set of HTTP endpoints exposed by the minion to determine what the application is doing. In order to access these endpoints, bind ports 8080 and 8180 to ports on the host. For example, for Docker, use docker run -p 80:8080 -p 81:8180 ...): :8080/status/check: Details about internal health-checks the minion performs; HTTP 200 means \"healthy.\" :8080/status: Details about a minion's status; the same data is then published to Insights as a SyntheticsPrivateMinion event. :8180/: JVM application admin endpoints; an advanced view of a minion's internal state. This approach is not as automated or flexible as the checksPending example. However, if you have total network connectivity failure, this manual approach can help troubleshoot the situation.",

      "body": "New Relic has resource limits in place to protect your experience, our systems, and our other customers. These limits range from the maximum number of characters you can have in a query, to API request rates, to how many events your queries inspect, and more. This page describes the limit metrics and NrIntegrationError events that enable you to view your limits, your current data usage and overall resource consumption as compared to those limits, and the impact of experiencing a limit event. We also provide a handful of queries that, when compiled into a dashboard, can give you consistent insight into your limits status. Important While NrIntegrationError events provide data on many limits types, resource limit metrics currently only cover request rate ingestion and API query rate limits. What happens when you reach a limit Our response to reaching a limit depends on a handful of factors: the type of limit that’s reached, as well as the duration, frequency, and amount at which you exceed the limit. Exceeding a limit doesn’t always mean you experience a limit event, such as dropped data, rejected traffic, or having your data turned off for the rest of the day. We sometimes allow a small buffer before enforcing a limit. That said, any resource consumed above 100% is at risk for limit impact at any time. Many of our rate limits apply proportionally. That means if you’re barely exceeding the limit, we will take less action than if you're exceeding by 200%. Limit metrics are only visible if you're sending data in to a corresponding dataType or limitName API. For example, if you send in data via the Metric API, you’ll see the Metric API resource metrics, but if you don't send any APM data in, you won't see APM resource metrics. Tip Impact metrics will be generated regardless of impact; if there's no impact, you’ll see a 0. An NrIntegrationError event is generated when you experience impact and is a good way to quickly see if you’re experiencing any limit events. See View System Limits for more information. Create a dashboard to view your limit status Using three limit metrics together on a dashboard, you can quickly see detailed visuals of your Ingest Resource Request Per Minute limits, and with NrIntegrationError get a view into more limits. Dashboard displaying limits status using a handful of queries. We used the following queries to create this dashboard. To make a dashboard like this in New Relic One, select Dashboards, and then Create a dashboard. Then, add a new chart for each query you want to regularly monitor. The three limits metrics included in these queries are described in a separate section, below. From left to right, top to bottom: Resource Consumption Limits as a % FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) /latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 facet limitName where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' timeseries limit max Copy Max % Consumption in an hour SELECT max(`usage`) FROM (FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) / latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 as 'usage' facet limitName timeseries ) facet limitName limit max Copy APM Agent API transaction events request per minute FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) where limitName = 'APM Agent API transaction events requests per minute' TIMESERIES Copy Trace API With limit line FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) as 'usage', latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) as 'limit' where limitName = 'Trace API requests per minute' TIMESERIES Copy Impact FACET From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, impact, resource TIMESERIES 1 minute limit max Copy NrIntegrationError by limit FROM NrIntegrationError select count(*) facet limitName TIMESERIES MAX since 1 day ago limit max Copy Multi-Account limits (on time series charts only) If you want to see limits for multiple accounts on one chart: run this query from one of the accounts: FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) / latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 facet limitName, consumingAccountId where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' timeseries limit max Copy Click Add another query. Select a different account. Then run this query again: FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) / latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 facet limitName, consumingAccountId where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' timeseries limit max Copy Finally, save it. Limit list and NrIntegrationError FROM Metric, NrIntegrationError select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) as 'Per Minute Count',latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) as ' limit Value',(rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute)/latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue)*100)as 'Percent Used', filter (count(*), where NrIntegrationError.limitValue is not null) as 'limit reached count' facet limitName limit 1000 Copy Limit metrics These metrics, used in the dashboard queries above, can hone in on a single limit or resource. Or, with the help of FACET limitName or resource provide a view across all your limits. newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue limitValue allows you to see the setting for a limit by limitName and understand more about what resource is linked to this limit. The following examples use the limit value metric in the query: Example for Metric API requests per minute. FROM Metric select latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) where limitName = 'Metric API requests per minute' Copy To show all limits, add FACET limitName and consider grouping by limitTimeInterval. FROM Metric select latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) WHERE limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' FACET limitName limit max Copy newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue currentValue shows you how much of a given resource you’re currently consuming. To get a better glimpse into how our systems are viewing your consumption, use a rate() function with the time period that aligns with the limitTimeInterval. Limit 200. Example for Metric API request per minute: FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue),1 minute) where limitName = 'Metric API requests per minute' Copy To show all limits, add FACET limitName and consider grouping by limitTimeInterval. FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue),1 minute) where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' FACET limitName limit max Copy newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact impact lets you know for any given resource what impact limit events are having. Zeros mean you are not currently impacted. The most granular we have is dataType. It is possible for multiple instances of limitName to impact a single type, such as Metric RPM and DPM. If we know, we will display limitName. From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, resource, impact, limitName TIMESERIES limit max Copy Metric attributes Attributes on newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue and newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue: limitName: The Name of the limit for the metric data, for example RPM Metric API. dataType: What kind of data the metric is tracking, for example Metric, Log, or APM. Resource: What resource is being consumed, for example Requests or DPM. limitTimeInterval: What time window this resource is evaluated for limiting. consumingAccountId: The New Relic account where the resource is being consumed. Attributes on newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact dataType: The kind of data that is being impacted, for example Metric, Log, or APM. Resource: What resource is being impacted, for example Request Rate. Impact: A count of what is happening when resource has exceeded set limit, for example dropped requests. consumingAccountId: The New Relic account where the resource is being consumed. Set alerts on resource metrics While building a dashboard to see all your limits is handy, being able to automate it is even better. You can set alerts on your limit metrics to provide updates on limits changes. Tip Because we currently only have metrics on 1 minute time windows, setting TimeWindow = 1 minute, will cover them all. Eventually, we make more metrics available, you might want to set separate alerts for limits that are enforced by different time windows. You can use the following NRQL queries to create alerts. Learn about creating alerts with NRQL queries here. Limits faceted by LimitName and scoped by Timewindow From Metric select (rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute)/latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue))*100 facet limitName Copy Alert on a single limit From Metric select (rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute)/latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue))*100 where limitName = 'my limit' Copy Alert on limit impact faceted by dataType, impact, resource, and reason From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, impact, resource, reason Copy Alert on impact of a single dataType From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, impact, resource, reason WHERE dataType = 'important things' Copy",

      "body": "Understanding how high cardinality works is important, because it can impact how quickly you reach your data limits. What is cardinality and why does it matter? Cardinality is generally defined as the number of elements in a set. For dimensional metrics, the set in question is the collection of unique maps of attributes observed for a given metric in a one-day period. You can query the cardinality of a metric in New Relic with the following NRQL format: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(metric.name) SINCE today RAW Copy For example, to query the cardinality of the metric memory.heap and find out how many unique key-value pairs exist for this metric, run the following query: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy Tip We recommend including the RAW clause in cardinality queries that use FROM Metric. This is because in the event your cardinality has been limited, queries like SINCE today will query rollups that are no longer reporting and so need to look at the raw data points to perform the necessary analysis. Note that because querying the raw data points over long time ranges can be slow, RAW queries spanning more than 2 days worth of data are not allowed. While the basics of what cardinality means can be simple to state, learning how to address and manage high cardinality can be a little more complicated. Cardinality limits and enforcement New Relic enforces limits on your metric cardinality both at the per-metric level and at the account level. Cardinality is evaluated over the course of a UTC day, starting at 00:00:00 UTC and ending at 23:59:59 UTC. For more information on data limits and related policies, see New Relic data usage limits and policies Cardinality and dimensional metrics The cardinality of a metric is the size of the set of unique maps of attributes observed for the given metric in a one-day period. If keys or values in that map change over time, they will add new cardinality for that metric. Let's see an example. Imagine a network of 4 hosts, each with 2 containers running on them, and each container periodically reports the gauge metric memory.heap, with the host name and container id added as attributes. When submitted to the Metric API, one of these metrics might look something like this: \"metrics\":[ { \"name\":\"memory.heap\", \"type\":\"gauge\", \"value\":5514, \"timestamp\":1234567890, \"attributes\":{ \"host\":\"W\", \"container\":\"1\" } } ] Copy This metric would then have a cardinality of 8, as that's how many unique mappings of host and container are possible. If a new measurement for this metric is taken with identical attributes as one that had previously reported, no new cardinality would be counted. Cardinality influences As shown above, any changes to the keys or values will represent new cardinality, but predicting how those changes will impact your total cardinality can get a little tricky. It's tempting to assume that the cardinality of a metric is then the product of the number of all possible values for each possible key, but this is rarely the case in practice, as the values a given key often depend on or determine the values of other keys. Using the previous example, once we had a container value of 1, the value of host was fixed to W, assuming those container IDs are globally unique. So while there are 8 containers across 4 hosts, the cardinality is still 8, not 4 * 8 = 32, since most combinations counted by the simple multiplication method are not possible and therefore don't contribute to that metric's cardinality. We will never see the combination of host = 'X', container = 1, for instance. This also means that adding more keys to an attributes map does not necessarily imply an increase to total cardinality. If the value of the new key is uniquely determined by the values of existing keys, it will not add new cardinality in the long term. For instance if you add something like region to your map in the example, it's likely the case that the container value is also fixed to a particular region value, and therefore keeps your cardinality at 8. An important caveat here is that while adding region won't increase the cardinality going forward, it will introduce new cardinality when it is first added. This is because adding keys will make those attribute maps distinct from any that came before them, temporarily increasing the total cardinality for that day. Examples and sample workflows If you hit one of your cardinality limits, there are a couple of options you can use to remedy the situation. One easy answer is increasing your limits, but if you would prefer not to do that, a good alternative is to explore which dimensions are contributing the most to your cardinality and think about removing them if they do not provide value. This can save storage and bandwidth costs and potentially prevent you needing to raise your limits. Find cardinality contributors: metrics Recall how to get the cardinality of a particular metric: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy For the total account cardinality, you can use the same basic query structure and simply omit the metric name: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW Copy The account's cardinality is essentially the sum of each metric's cardinality, so adding in a simple FACET query can help find the highest cardinality metrics: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW FACET metricName Copy Finally, if you believe you have hit one of your cardinality limits, you can confirm this by checking for a related NrIntegrationError: FROM NrIntegrationError SELECT count(*) where name = 'CardinalityViolationException' and newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' facet cardinalityLimitType, metricName, message since today Copy Finding cardinality contributors: dimensions Once you've determined a metric you want to explore, the next step is to determine which dimensions in a given metric contribute the most to its cardinality. If you are unfamiliar with the values of your dimensions, you can look at them like so: FROM Metric SELECT dimensions() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy The JSON results view will likely be advisable here. Looking through these could reveal some dimensions containing a unique ID or other highly variable value that might be worth removing. If you are already familiar with what values your attributes can take on, the keySet() results may be easier to scan: FROM Metric SELECT keySet() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy Understanding the dimensions that have the most influence on your total cardinality comes down to understanding how each key's values correlate with one another. You can experiment with what your cardinality would be without a dimension simply by adding it to the exclude list: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, exclude: {'container.id'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Likewise, there is an include list if that is more convenient to the query context: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, include: {'host.name', 'region'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Managing cardinality can be tricky to conceptualize, but the above methods will help you get answers to questions like \"What metric is contributing the most cardinality?\" and \"What impact does a given attribute(s) have to that total cardinality?\". It's often the case that cardinality tracks with the most unique value, as that value may pin down the possible values other attributes can take on. However, there are plenty of cases where the explosion of possible combinations of a handful of attributes drives the total cardinality. Things that look like unique identifiers are generally a good place to start, but sometimes it's no single key but the combination of two or more keys. The more familiar you are with your data and the systems that generate it, the easier it will be to know which attributes to include or exclude. Tip If you'd like to learn more about limits and troubleshooting the Metric API, here are two good resources: Metric API limits and restricted attributes Troubleshoot Metric API with NRIntegrationError events are both great resources to explore.",

Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), percentile(), average() or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute, and you can use the OR operator to facet results that don't match any of your specified cases. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy Facet non-matching data with OR This example uses the OR operator to facet results that didn't match any of your cases: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') OR name Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE r'z.*|q.*'' hostname RLIKE r'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' z-app q-app ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions In this section we explain NRQL functions, both aggregator functions and non-aggregator functions. Aggregator functions You can use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data. Some tips for using these: See New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. If you're using an aggregator function multiple times in the same query (for example, SELECT median(one_metric), median(another_metric)), it can cause problems in displaying results. To solve this, use the AS function. For example: `SELECT median(one_metric) as 'med-a', median(another_metric) as 'med-b'` Copy Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. For how to display results over time, see Group results over time. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in the same unit of time as the chosen attribute. For instance, if the attribute is measured in seconds, t will be a threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (that is, seconds 0 to 59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy capture(attribute, regular expression) Use the capture() to extract values from an attribute using a regular expression. Uses RE2 syntax. It takes two arguments: Attribute name Regular expression with capture syntax. Regex expressions in NRQL use Python-like syntax, r'...'. When capturing, use the RE2 named-capture syntax ...(?P<name> pattern )... to capture the contained pattern, given the specified name. Currently, only 1 capture group is supported. Please see the examples below. capture() within a SELECT clause condition The following will select the domain name of the website, removing https:// and any paths following the .com SELECT capture(pageUrl, r'https://(?P<baseUrl>.*.com)/.+') FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The following will capture only the first word of the error message. SELECT capture(errorMessage, r'(?P<firstWord>\\S+)\\s.+') FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago where errorMessage is not null Copy capture() within a FACET clause condition The following will facet by the captured HTTP method. SELECT count(*) FROM Log WHERE message like '%HTTP%' FACET capture(message, r'.* \"(?P<httpMethod>[A-Z]+) .*') Copy capture() within a WHERE clause condition The following will filter the results based on Log events with message attribute that matches the regular expression where the captured job name is ExampleJob. SELECT message FROM Log WHERE capture(message, r'.*Job Failed: (?P<jobName>[A-Za-z]+),.*') = 'ExampleJob' SINCE 10 minutes ago Copy capture() with a numeric cast The following will capture sum of CPU Time from log lines. You must explicitly cast to numeric to do mathematical operations. SELECT sum(numeric(capture(message, r'.*CpuTime:\\s(?P<cpuTime>\\d+)'))) FROM Log WHERE message like '%CpuTime:%' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. Ready to get started? If you haven't already, be sure to sign up for a New Relic account. It's free, forever. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by APM, browser, and mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the data explorer. Learn more about querying data in New Relic. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data from browser monitoring. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for browser monitoring PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "Understanding how high cardinality works is important, because it can impact how quickly you reach your data limits. What is cardinality and why does it matter? Cardinality is generally defined as the number of elements in a set. For dimensional metrics, the set in question is the collection of unique maps of attributes observed for a given metric in a one-day period. You can query the cardinality of a metric in New Relic with the following NRQL format: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(metric.name) SINCE today RAW Copy For example, to query the cardinality of the metric memory.heap and find out how many unique key-value pairs exist for this metric, run the following query: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy Tip We recommend including the RAW clause in cardinality queries that use FROM Metric. This is because in the event your cardinality has been limited, queries like SINCE today will query rollups that are no longer reporting and so need to look at the raw data points to perform the necessary analysis. Note that because querying the raw data points over long time ranges can be slow, RAW queries spanning more than 2 days worth of data are not allowed. While the basics of what cardinality means can be simple to state, learning how to address and manage high cardinality can be a little more complicated. Cardinality limits and enforcement New Relic enforces limits on your metric cardinality both at the per-metric level and at the account level. Cardinality is evaluated over the course of a UTC day, starting at 00:00:00 UTC and ending at 23:59:59 UTC. For more information on data limits and related policies, see New Relic data usage limits and policies Cardinality and dimensional metrics The cardinality of a metric is the size of the set of unique maps of attributes observed for the given metric in a one-day period. If keys or values in that map change over time, they will add new cardinality for that metric. Let's see an example. Imagine a network of 4 hosts, each with 2 containers running on them, and each container periodically reports the gauge metric memory.heap, with the host name and container id added as attributes. When submitted to the Metric API, one of these metrics might look something like this: \"metrics\":[ { \"name\":\"memory.heap\", \"type\":\"gauge\", \"value\":5514, \"timestamp\":1234567890, \"attributes\":{ \"host\":\"W\", \"container\":\"1\" } } ] Copy This metric would then have a cardinality of 8, as that's how many unique mappings of host and container are possible. If a new measurement for this metric is taken with identical attributes as one that had previously reported, no new cardinality would be counted. Cardinality influences As shown above, any changes to the keys or values will represent new cardinality, but predicting how those changes will impact your total cardinality can get a little tricky. It's tempting to assume that the cardinality of a metric is then the product of the number of all possible values for each possible key, but this is rarely the case in practice, as the values a given key often depend on or determine the values of other keys. Using the previous example, once we had a container value of 1, the value of host was fixed to W, assuming those container IDs are globally unique. So while there are 8 containers across 4 hosts, the cardinality is still 8, not 4 * 8 = 32, since most combinations counted by the simple multiplication method are not possible and therefore don't contribute to that metric's cardinality. We will never see the combination of host = 'X', container = 1, for instance. This also means that adding more keys to an attributes map does not necessarily imply an increase to total cardinality. If the value of the new key is uniquely determined by the values of existing keys, it will not add new cardinality in the long term. For instance if you add something like region to your map in the example, it's likely the case that the container value is also fixed to a particular region value, and therefore keeps your cardinality at 8. An important caveat here is that while adding region won't increase the cardinality going forward, it will introduce new cardinality when it is first added. This is because adding keys will make those attribute maps distinct from any that came before them, temporarily increasing the total cardinality for that day. Examples and sample workflows If you hit one of your cardinality limits, there are a couple of options you can use to remedy the situation. One easy answer is increasing your limits, but if you would prefer not to do that, a good alternative is to explore which dimensions are contributing the most to your cardinality and think about removing them if they do not provide value. This can save storage and bandwidth costs and potentially prevent you needing to raise your limits. Find cardinality contributors: metrics Recall how to get the cardinality of a particular metric: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy For the total account cardinality, you can use the same basic query structure and simply omit the metric name: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW Copy The account's cardinality is essentially the sum of each metric's cardinality, so adding in a simple FACET query can help find the highest cardinality metrics: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW FACET metricName Copy Finally, if you believe you have hit one of your cardinality limits, you can confirm this by checking for a related NrIntegrationError: FROM NrIntegrationError SELECT count(*) where name = 'CardinalityViolationException' and newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' facet cardinalityLimitType, metricName, message since today Copy Finding cardinality contributors: dimensions Once you've determined a metric you want to explore, the next step is to determine which dimensions in a given metric contribute the most to its cardinality. If you are unfamiliar with the values of your dimensions, you can look at them like so: FROM Metric SELECT dimensions() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy The JSON results view will likely be advisable here. Looking through these could reveal some dimensions containing a unique ID or other highly variable value that might be worth removing. If you are already familiar with what values your attributes can take on, the keySet() results may be easier to scan: FROM Metric SELECT keySet() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy Understanding the dimensions that have the most influence on your total cardinality comes down to understanding how each key's values correlate with one another. You can experiment with what your cardinality would be without a dimension simply by adding it to the exclude list: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, exclude: {'container.id'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Likewise, there is an include list if that is more convenient to the query context: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, include: {'host.name', 'region'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Managing cardinality can be tricky to conceptualize, but the above methods will help you get answers to questions like \"What metric is contributing the most cardinality?\" and \"What impact does a given attribute(s) have to that total cardinality?\". It's often the case that cardinality tracks with the most unique value, as that value may pin down the possible values other attributes can take on. However, there are plenty of cases where the explosion of possible combinations of a handful of attributes drives the total cardinality. Things that look like unique identifiers are generally a good place to start, but sometimes it's no single key but the combination of two or more keys. The more familiar you are with your data and the systems that generate it, the easier it will be to know which attributes to include or exclude. Tip If you'd like to learn more about limits and troubleshooting the Metric API, here are two good resources: Metric API limits and restricted attributes Troubleshoot Metric API with NRIntegrationError events are both great resources to explore.",

Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), percentile(), average() or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute, and you can use the OR operator to facet results that don't match any of your specified cases. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy Facet non-matching data with OR This example uses the OR operator to facet results that didn't match any of your cases: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') OR name Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE r'z.*|q.*'' hostname RLIKE r'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' z-app q-app ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions In this section we explain NRQL functions, both aggregator functions and non-aggregator functions. Aggregator functions You can use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data. Some tips for using these: See New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. If you're using an aggregator function multiple times in the same query (for example, SELECT median(one_metric), median(another_metric)), it can cause problems in displaying results. To solve this, use the AS function. For example: `SELECT median(one_metric) as 'med-a', median(another_metric) as 'med-b'` Copy Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. For how to display results over time, see Group results over time. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in the same unit of time as the chosen attribute. For instance, if the attribute is measured in seconds, t will be a threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (that is, seconds 0 to 59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy capture(attribute, regular expression) Use the capture() to extract values from an attribute using a regular expression. Uses RE2 syntax. It takes two arguments: Attribute name Regular expression with capture syntax. Regex expressions in NRQL use Python-like syntax, r'...'. When capturing, use the RE2 named-capture syntax ...(?P<name> pattern )... to capture the contained pattern, given the specified name. Currently, only 1 capture group is supported. Please see the examples below. capture() within a SELECT clause condition The following will select the domain name of the website, removing https:// and any paths following the .com SELECT capture(pageUrl, r'https://(?P<baseUrl>.*.com)/.+') FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The following will capture only the first word of the error message. SELECT capture(errorMessage, r'(?P<firstWord>\\S+)\\s.+') FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago where errorMessage is not null Copy capture() within a FACET clause condition The following will facet by the captured HTTP method. SELECT count(*) FROM Log WHERE message like '%HTTP%' FACET capture(message, r'.* \"(?P<httpMethod>[A-Z]+) .*') Copy capture() within a WHERE clause condition The following will filter the results based on Log events with message attribute that matches the regular expression where the captured job name is ExampleJob. SELECT message FROM Log WHERE capture(message, r'.*Job Failed: (?P<jobName>[A-Za-z]+),.*') = 'ExampleJob' SINCE 10 minutes ago Copy capture() with a numeric cast The following will capture sum of CPU Time from log lines. You must explicitly cast to numeric to do mathematical operations. SELECT sum(numeric(capture(message, r'.*CpuTime:\\s(?P<cpuTime>\\d+)'))) FROM Log WHERE message like '%CpuTime:%' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. Ready to get started? If you haven't already, be sure to sign up for a New Relic account. It's free, forever. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by APM, browser, and mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the data explorer. Learn more about querying data in New Relic. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data from browser monitoring. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for browser monitoring PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "Understanding how high cardinality works is important, because it can impact how quickly you reach your data limits. What is cardinality and why does it matter? Cardinality is generally defined as the number of elements in a set. For dimensional metrics, the set in question is the collection of unique maps of attributes observed for a given metric in a one-day period. You can query the cardinality of a metric in New Relic with the following NRQL format: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(metric.name) SINCE today RAW Copy For example, to query the cardinality of the metric memory.heap and find out how many unique key-value pairs exist for this metric, run the following query: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy Tip We recommend including the RAW clause in cardinality queries that use FROM Metric. This is because in the event your cardinality has been limited, queries like SINCE today will query rollups that are no longer reporting and so need to look at the raw data points to perform the necessary analysis. Note that because querying the raw data points over long time ranges can be slow, RAW queries spanning more than 2 days worth of data are not allowed. While the basics of what cardinality means can be simple to state, learning how to address and manage high cardinality can be a little more complicated. Cardinality limits and enforcement New Relic enforces limits on your metric cardinality both at the per-metric level and at the account level. Cardinality is evaluated over the course of a UTC day, starting at 00:00:00 UTC and ending at 23:59:59 UTC. For more information on data limits and related policies, see New Relic data usage limits and policies Cardinality and dimensional metrics The cardinality of a metric is the size of the set of unique maps of attributes observed for the given metric in a one-day period. If keys or values in that map change over time, they will add new cardinality for that metric. Let's see an example. Imagine a network of 4 hosts, each with 2 containers running on them, and each container periodically reports the gauge metric memory.heap, with the host name and container id added as attributes. When submitted to the Metric API, one of these metrics might look something like this: \"metrics\":[ { \"name\":\"memory.heap\", \"type\":\"gauge\", \"value\":5514, \"timestamp\":1234567890, \"attributes\":{ \"host\":\"W\", \"container\":\"1\" } } ] Copy This metric would then have a cardinality of 8, as that's how many unique mappings of host and container are possible. If a new measurement for this metric is taken with identical attributes as one that had previously reported, no new cardinality would be counted. Cardinality influences As shown above, any changes to the keys or values will represent new cardinality, but predicting how those changes will impact your total cardinality can get a little tricky. It's tempting to assume that the cardinality of a metric is then the product of the number of all possible values for each possible key, but this is rarely the case in practice, as the values a given key often depend on or determine the values of other keys. Using the previous example, once we had a container value of 1, the value of host was fixed to W, assuming those container IDs are globally unique. So while there are 8 containers across 4 hosts, the cardinality is still 8, not 4 * 8 = 32, since most combinations counted by the simple multiplication method are not possible and therefore don't contribute to that metric's cardinality. We will never see the combination of host = 'X', container = 1, for instance. This also means that adding more keys to an attributes map does not necessarily imply an increase to total cardinality. If the value of the new key is uniquely determined by the values of existing keys, it will not add new cardinality in the long term. For instance if you add something like region to your map in the example, it's likely the case that the container value is also fixed to a particular region value, and therefore keeps your cardinality at 8. An important caveat here is that while adding region won't increase the cardinality going forward, it will introduce new cardinality when it is first added. This is because adding keys will make those attribute maps distinct from any that came before them, temporarily increasing the total cardinality for that day. Examples and sample workflows If you hit one of your cardinality limits, there are a couple of options you can use to remedy the situation. One easy answer is increasing your limits, but if you would prefer not to do that, a good alternative is to explore which dimensions are contributing the most to your cardinality and think about removing them if they do not provide value. This can save storage and bandwidth costs and potentially prevent you needing to raise your limits. Find cardinality contributors: metrics Recall how to get the cardinality of a particular metric: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy For the total account cardinality, you can use the same basic query structure and simply omit the metric name: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW Copy The account's cardinality is essentially the sum of each metric's cardinality, so adding in a simple FACET query can help find the highest cardinality metrics: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW FACET metricName Copy Finally, if you believe you have hit one of your cardinality limits, you can confirm this by checking for a related NrIntegrationError: FROM NrIntegrationError SELECT count(*) where name = 'CardinalityViolationException' and newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' facet cardinalityLimitType, metricName, message since today Copy Finding cardinality contributors: dimensions Once you've determined a metric you want to explore, the next step is to determine which dimensions in a given metric contribute the most to its cardinality. If you are unfamiliar with the values of your dimensions, you can look at them like so: FROM Metric SELECT dimensions() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy The JSON results view will likely be advisable here. Looking through these could reveal some dimensions containing a unique ID or other highly variable value that might be worth removing. If you are already familiar with what values your attributes can take on, the keySet() results may be easier to scan: FROM Metric SELECT keySet() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy Understanding the dimensions that have the most influence on your total cardinality comes down to understanding how each key's values correlate with one another. You can experiment with what your cardinality would be without a dimension simply by adding it to the exclude list: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, exclude: {'container.id'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Likewise, there is an include list if that is more convenient to the query context: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, include: {'host.name', 'region'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Managing cardinality can be tricky to conceptualize, but the above methods will help you get answers to questions like \"What metric is contributing the most cardinality?\" and \"What impact does a given attribute(s) have to that total cardinality?\". It's often the case that cardinality tracks with the most unique value, as that value may pin down the possible values other attributes can take on. However, there are plenty of cases where the explosion of possible combinations of a handful of attributes drives the total cardinality. Things that look like unique identifiers are generally a good place to start, but sometimes it's no single key but the combination of two or more keys. The more familiar you are with your data and the systems that generate it, the easier it will be to know which attributes to include or exclude. Tip If you'd like to learn more about limits and troubleshooting the Metric API, here are two good resources: Metric API limits and restricted attributes Troubleshoot Metric API with NRIntegrationError events are both great resources to explore.",

(SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), percentile(), average() or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute, and you can use the OR operator to facet results that don't match any of your specified cases. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy Facet non-matching data with OR This example uses the OR operator to facet results that didn't match any of your cases: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') OR name Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE r'z.*|q.*'' hostname RLIKE r'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' z-app q-app ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions In this section we explain NRQL functions, both aggregator functions and non-aggregator functions. Aggregator functions You can use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data. Some tips for using these: See New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. If you're using an aggregator function multiple times in the same query (for example, SELECT median(one_metric), median(another_metric)), it can cause problems in displaying results. To solve this, use the AS function. For example: `SELECT median(one_metric) as 'med-a', median(another_metric) as 'med-b'` Copy Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. For how to display results over time, see Group results over time. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in the same unit of time as the chosen attribute. For instance, if the attribute is measured in seconds, t will be a threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (that is, seconds 0 to 59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy capture(attribute, regular expression) Use the capture() to extract values from an attribute using a regular expression. Uses RE2 syntax. It takes two arguments: Attribute name Regular expression with capture syntax. Regex expressions in NRQL use Python-like syntax, r'...'. When capturing, use the RE2 named-capture syntax ...(?P<name> pattern )... to capture the contained pattern, given the specified name. Currently, only 1 capture group is supported. Please see the examples below. capture() within a SELECT clause condition The following will select the domain name of the website, removing https:// and any paths following the .com SELECT capture(pageUrl, r'https://(?P<baseUrl>.*.com)/.+') FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The following will capture only the first word of the error message. SELECT capture(errorMessage, r'(?P<firstWord>\\S+)\\s.+') FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago where errorMessage is not null Copy capture() within a FACET clause condition The following will facet by the captured HTTP method. SELECT count(*) FROM Log WHERE message like '%HTTP%' FACET capture(message, r'.* \"(?P<httpMethod>[A-Z]+) .*') Copy capture() within a WHERE clause condition The following will filter the results based on Log events with message attribute that matches the regular expression where the captured job name is ExampleJob. SELECT message FROM Log WHERE capture(message, r'.*Job Failed: (?P<jobName>[A-Za-z]+),.*') = 'ExampleJob' SINCE 10 minutes ago Copy capture() with a numeric cast The following will capture sum of CPU Time from log lines. You must explicitly cast to numeric to do mathematical operations. SELECT sum(numeric(capture(message, r'.*CpuTime:\\s(?P<cpuTime>\\d+)'))) FROM Log WHERE message like '%CpuTime:%' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. Ready to get started? If you haven't already, be sure to sign up for a New Relic account. It's free, forever. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by APM, browser, and mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the data explorer. Learn more about querying data in New Relic. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data from browser monitoring. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for browser monitoring PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "Understanding how high cardinality works is important, because it can impact how quickly you reach your data limits. What is cardinality and why does it matter? Cardinality is generally defined as the number of elements in a set. For dimensional metrics, the set in question is the collection of unique maps of attributes observed for a given metric in a one-day period. You can query the cardinality of a metric in New Relic with the following NRQL format: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(metric.name) SINCE today RAW Copy For example, to query the cardinality of the metric memory.heap and find out how many unique key-value pairs exist for this metric, run the following query: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy Tip We recommend including the RAW clause in cardinality queries that use FROM Metric. This is because in the event your cardinality has been limited, queries like SINCE today will query rollups that are no longer reporting and so need to look at the raw data points to perform the necessary analysis. Note that because querying the raw data points over long time ranges can be slow, RAW queries spanning more than 2 days worth of data are not allowed. While the basics of what cardinality means can be simple to state, learning how to address and manage high cardinality can be a little more complicated. Cardinality limits and enforcement New Relic enforces limits on your metric cardinality both at the per-metric level and at the account level. Cardinality is evaluated over the course of a UTC day, starting at 00:00:00 UTC and ending at 23:59:59 UTC. For more information on data limits and related policies, see New Relic data usage limits and policies Cardinality and dimensional metrics The cardinality of a metric is the size of the set of unique maps of attributes observed for the given metric in a one-day period. If keys or values in that map change over time, they will add new cardinality for that metric. Let's see an example. Imagine a network of 4 hosts, each with 2 containers running on them, and each container periodically reports the gauge metric memory.heap, with the host name and container id added as attributes. When submitted to the Metric API, one of these metrics might look something like this: \"metrics\":[ { \"name\":\"memory.heap\", \"type\":\"gauge\", \"value\":5514, \"timestamp\":1234567890, \"attributes\":{ \"host\":\"W\", \"container\":\"1\" } } ] Copy This metric would then have a cardinality of 8, as that's how many unique mappings of host and container are possible. If a new measurement for this metric is taken with identical attributes as one that had previously reported, no new cardinality would be counted. Cardinality influences As shown above, any changes to the keys or values will represent new cardinality, but predicting how those changes will impact your total cardinality can get a little tricky. It's tempting to assume that the cardinality of a metric is then the product of the number of all possible values for each possible key, but this is rarely the case in practice, as the values a given key often depend on or determine the values of other keys. Using the previous example, once we had a container value of 1, the value of host was fixed to W, assuming those container IDs are globally unique. So while there are 8 containers across 4 hosts, the cardinality is still 8, not 4 * 8 = 32, since most combinations counted by the simple multiplication method are not possible and therefore don't contribute to that metric's cardinality. We will never see the combination of host = 'X', container = 1, for instance. This also means that adding more keys to an attributes map does not necessarily imply an increase to total cardinality. If the value of the new key is uniquely determined by the values of existing keys, it will not add new cardinality in the long term. For instance if you add something like region to your map in the example, it's likely the case that the container value is also fixed to a particular region value, and therefore keeps your cardinality at 8. An important caveat here is that while adding region won't increase the cardinality going forward, it will introduce new cardinality when it is first added. This is because adding keys will make those attribute maps distinct from any that came before them, temporarily increasing the total cardinality for that day. Examples and sample workflows If you hit one of your cardinality limits, there are a couple of options you can use to remedy the situation. One easy answer is increasing your limits, but if you would prefer not to do that, a good alternative is to explore which dimensions are contributing the most to your cardinality and think about removing them if they do not provide value. This can save storage and bandwidth costs and potentially prevent you needing to raise your limits. Find cardinality contributors: metrics Recall how to get the cardinality of a particular metric: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy For the total account cardinality, you can use the same basic query structure and simply omit the metric name: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW Copy The account's cardinality is essentially the sum of each metric's cardinality, so adding in a simple FACET query can help find the highest cardinality metrics: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW FACET metricName Copy Finally, if you believe you have hit one of your cardinality limits, you can confirm this by checking for a related NrIntegrationError: FROM NrIntegrationError SELECT count(*) where name = 'CardinalityViolationException' and newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' facet cardinalityLimitType, metricName, message since today Copy Finding cardinality contributors: dimensions Once you've determined a metric you want to explore, the next step is to determine which dimensions in a given metric contribute the most to its cardinality. If you are unfamiliar with the values of your dimensions, you can look at them like so: FROM Metric SELECT dimensions() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy The JSON results view will likely be advisable here. Looking through these could reveal some dimensions containing a unique ID or other highly variable value that might be worth removing. If you are already familiar with what values your attributes can take on, the keySet() results may be easier to scan: FROM Metric SELECT keySet() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy Understanding the dimensions that have the most influence on your total cardinality comes down to understanding how each key's values correlate with one another. You can experiment with what your cardinality would be without a dimension simply by adding it to the exclude list: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, exclude: {'container.id'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Likewise, there is an include list if that is more convenient to the query context: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, include: {'host.name', 'region'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Managing cardinality can be tricky to conceptualize, but the above methods will help you get answers to questions like \"What metric is contributing the most cardinality?\" and \"What impact does a given attribute(s) have to that total cardinality?\". It's often the case that cardinality tracks with the most unique value, as that value may pin down the possible values other attributes can take on. However, there are plenty of cases where the explosion of possible combinations of a handful of attributes drives the total cardinality. Things that look like unique identifiers are generally a good place to start, but sometimes it's no single key but the combination of two or more keys. The more familiar you are with your data and the systems that generate it, the easier it will be to know which attributes to include or exclude. Tip If you'd like to learn more about limits and troubleshooting the Metric API, here are two good resources: Metric API limits and restricted attributes Troubleshoot Metric API with NRIntegrationError events are both great resources to explore.",

Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), percentile(), average() or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute, and you can use the OR operator to facet results that don't match any of your specified cases. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy Facet non-matching data with OR This example uses the OR operator to facet results that didn't match any of your cases: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') OR name Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE r'z.*|q.*'' hostname RLIKE r'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' z-app q-app ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions In this section we explain NRQL functions, both aggregator functions and non-aggregator functions. Aggregator functions You can use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data. Some tips for using these: See New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. If you're using an aggregator function multiple times in the same query (for example, SELECT median(one_metric), median(another_metric)), it can cause problems in displaying results. To solve this, use the AS function. For example: `SELECT median(one_metric) as 'med-a', median(another_metric) as 'med-b'` Copy Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. For how to display results over time, see Group results over time. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in the same unit of time as the chosen attribute. For instance, if the attribute is measured in seconds, t will be a threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (that is, seconds 0 to 59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy capture(attribute, regular expression) Use the capture() to extract values from an attribute using a regular expression. Uses RE2 syntax. It takes two arguments: Attribute name Regular expression with capture syntax. Regex expressions in NRQL use Python-like syntax, r'...'. When capturing, use the RE2 named-capture syntax ...(?P<name> pattern )... to capture the contained pattern, given the specified name. Currently, only 1 capture group is supported. Please see the examples below. capture() within a SELECT clause condition The following will select the domain name of the website, removing https:// and any paths following the .com SELECT capture(pageUrl, r'https://(?P<baseUrl>.*.com)/.+') FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The following will capture only the first word of the error message. SELECT capture(errorMessage, r'(?P<firstWord>\\S+)\\s.+') FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago where errorMessage is not null Copy capture() within a FACET clause condition The following will facet by the captured HTTP method. SELECT count(*) FROM Log WHERE message like '%HTTP%' FACET capture(message, r'.* \"(?P<httpMethod>[A-Z]+) .*') Copy capture() within a WHERE clause condition The following will filter the results based on Log events with message attribute that matches the regular expression where the captured job name is ExampleJob. SELECT message FROM Log WHERE capture(message, r'.*Job Failed: (?P<jobName>[A-Za-z]+),.*') = 'ExampleJob' SINCE 10 minutes ago Copy capture() with a numeric cast The following will capture sum of CPU Time from log lines. You must explicitly cast to numeric to do mathematical operations. SELECT sum(numeric(capture(message, r'.*CpuTime:\\s(?P<cpuTime>\\d+)'))) FROM Log WHERE message like '%CpuTime:%' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. Ready to get started? If you haven't already, be sure to sign up for a New Relic account. It's free, forever. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by APM, browser, and mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the data explorer. Learn more about querying data in New Relic. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data from browser monitoring. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for browser monitoring PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "Understanding how high cardinality works is important, because it can impact how quickly you reach your data limits. What is cardinality and why does it matter? Cardinality is generally defined as the number of elements in a set. For dimensional metrics, the set in question is the collection of unique maps of attributes observed for a given metric in a one-day period. You can query the cardinality of a metric in New Relic with the following NRQL format: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(metric.name) SINCE today RAW Copy For example, to query the cardinality of the metric memory.heap and find out how many unique key-value pairs exist for this metric, run the following query: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy Tip We recommend including the RAW clause in cardinality queries that use FROM Metric. This is because in the event your cardinality has been limited, queries like SINCE today will query rollups that are no longer reporting and so need to look at the raw data points to perform the necessary analysis. Note that because querying the raw data points over long time ranges can be slow, RAW queries spanning more than 2 days worth of data are not allowed. While the basics of what cardinality means can be simple to state, learning how to address and manage high cardinality can be a little more complicated. Cardinality limits and enforcement New Relic enforces limits on your metric cardinality both at the per-metric level and at the account level. Cardinality is evaluated over the course of a UTC day, starting at 00:00:00 UTC and ending at 23:59:59 UTC. For more information on data limits and related policies, see New Relic data usage limits and policies Cardinality and dimensional metrics The cardinality of a metric is the size of the set of unique maps of attributes observed for the given metric in a one-day period. If keys or values in that map change over time, they will add new cardinality for that metric. Let's see an example. Imagine a network of 4 hosts, each with 2 containers running on them, and each container periodically reports the gauge metric memory.heap, with the host name and container id added as attributes. When submitted to the Metric API, one of these metrics might look something like this: \"metrics\":[ { \"name\":\"memory.heap\", \"type\":\"gauge\", \"value\":5514, \"timestamp\":1234567890, \"attributes\":{ \"host\":\"W\", \"container\":\"1\" } } ] Copy This metric would then have a cardinality of 8, as that's how many unique mappings of host and container are possible. If a new measurement for this metric is taken with identical attributes as one that had previously reported, no new cardinality would be counted. Cardinality influences As shown above, any changes to the keys or values will represent new cardinality, but predicting how those changes will impact your total cardinality can get a little tricky. It's tempting to assume that the cardinality of a metric is then the product of the number of all possible values for each possible key, but this is rarely the case in practice, as the values a given key often depend on or determine the values of other keys. Using the previous example, once we had a container value of 1, the value of host was fixed to W, assuming those container IDs are globally unique. So while there are 8 containers across 4 hosts, the cardinality is still 8, not 4 * 8 = 32, since most combinations counted by the simple multiplication method are not possible and therefore don't contribute to that metric's cardinality. We will never see the combination of host = 'X', container = 1, for instance. This also means that adding more keys to an attributes map does not necessarily imply an increase to total cardinality. If the value of the new key is uniquely determined by the values of existing keys, it will not add new cardinality in the long term. For instance if you add something like region to your map in the example, it's likely the case that the container value is also fixed to a particular region value, and therefore keeps your cardinality at 8. An important caveat here is that while adding region won't increase the cardinality going forward, it will introduce new cardinality when it is first added. This is because adding keys will make those attribute maps distinct from any that came before them, temporarily increasing the total cardinality for that day. Examples and sample workflows If you hit one of your cardinality limits, there are a couple of options you can use to remedy the situation. One easy answer is increasing your limits, but if you would prefer not to do that, a good alternative is to explore which dimensions are contributing the most to your cardinality and think about removing them if they do not provide value. This can save storage and bandwidth costs and potentially prevent you needing to raise your limits. Find cardinality contributors: metrics Recall how to get the cardinality of a particular metric: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy For the total account cardinality, you can use the same basic query structure and simply omit the metric name: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW Copy The account's cardinality is essentially the sum of each metric's cardinality, so adding in a simple FACET query can help find the highest cardinality metrics: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW FACET metricName Copy Finally, if you believe you have hit one of your cardinality limits, you can confirm this by checking for a related NrIntegrationError: FROM NrIntegrationError SELECT count(*) where name = 'CardinalityViolationException' and newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' facet cardinalityLimitType, metricName, message since today Copy Finding cardinality contributors: dimensions Once you've determined a metric you want to explore, the next step is to determine which dimensions in a given metric contribute the most to its cardinality. If you are unfamiliar with the values of your dimensions, you can look at them like so: FROM Metric SELECT dimensions() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy The JSON results view will likely be advisable here. Looking through these could reveal some dimensions containing a unique ID or other highly variable value that might be worth removing. If you are already familiar with what values your attributes can take on, the keySet() results may be easier to scan: FROM Metric SELECT keySet() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy Understanding the dimensions that have the most influence on your total cardinality comes down to understanding how each key's values correlate with one another. You can experiment with what your cardinality would be without a dimension simply by adding it to the exclude list: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, exclude: {'container.id'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Likewise, there is an include list if that is more convenient to the query context: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, include: {'host.name', 'region'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Managing cardinality can be tricky to conceptualize, but the above methods will help you get answers to questions like \"What metric is contributing the most cardinality?\" and \"What impact does a given attribute(s) have to that total cardinality?\". It's often the case that cardinality tracks with the most unique value, as that value may pin down the possible values other attributes can take on. However, there are plenty of cases where the explosion of possible combinations of a handful of attributes drives the total cardinality. Things that look like unique identifiers are generally a good place to start, but sometimes it's no single key but the combination of two or more keys. The more familiar you are with your data and the systems that generate it, the easier it will be to know which attributes to include or exclude.

Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), percentile(), average() or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute, and you can use the OR operator to facet results that don't match any of your specified cases. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy Facet non-matching data with OR This example uses the OR operator to facet results that didn't match any of your cases: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') OR name Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE r'z.*|q.*'' hostname RLIKE r'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' z-app q-app ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions In this section we explain NRQL functions, both aggregator functions and non-aggregator functions. Aggregator functions You can use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data. Some tips for using these: See New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. If you're using an aggregator function multiple times in the same query (for example, SELECT median(one_metric), median(another_metric)), it can cause problems in displaying results. To solve this, use the AS function. For example: `SELECT median(one_metric) as 'med-a', median(another_metric) as 'med-b'` Copy Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. For how to display results over time, see Group results over time. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in the same unit of time as the chosen attribute. For instance, if the attribute is measured in seconds, t will be a threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (that is, seconds 0 to 59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy capture(attribute, regular expression) Use the capture() to extract values from an attribute using a regular expression. Uses RE2 syntax. It takes two arguments: Attribute name Regular expression with capture syntax. Regex expressions in NRQL use Python-like syntax, r'...'. When capturing, use the RE2 named-capture syntax ...(?P<name> pattern )... to capture the contained pattern, given the specified name. Currently, only 1 capture group is supported. Please see the examples below. capture() within a SELECT clause condition The following will select the domain name of the website, removing https:// and any paths following the .com SELECT capture(pageUrl, r'https://(?P<baseUrl>.*.com)/.+') FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The following will capture only the first word of the error message. SELECT capture(errorMessage, r'(?P<firstWord>\\S+)\\s.+') FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago where errorMessage is not null Copy capture() within a FACET clause condition The following will facet by the captured HTTP method. SELECT count(*) FROM Log WHERE message like '%HTTP%' FACET capture(message, r'.* \"(?P<httpMethod>[A-Z]+) .*') Copy capture() within a WHERE clause condition The following will filter the results based on Log events with message attribute that matches the regular expression where the captured job name is ExampleJob. SELECT message FROM Log WHERE capture(message, r'.*Job Failed: (?P<jobName>[A-Za-z]+),.*') = 'ExampleJob' SINCE 10 minutes ago Copy capture() with a numeric cast The following will capture sum of CPU Time from log lines. You must explicitly cast to numeric to do mathematical operations. SELECT sum(numeric(capture(message, r'.*CpuTime:\\s(?P<cpuTime>\\d+)'))) FROM Log WHERE message like '%CpuTime:%' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. Ready to get started? If you haven't already, be sure to sign up for a New Relic account. It's free, forever. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by APM, browser, and mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the data explorer. Learn more about querying data in New Relic. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data from browser monitoring. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for browser monitoring PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "Understanding how high cardinality works is important, because it can impact how quickly you reach your data limits. What is cardinality and why does it matter? Cardinality is generally defined as the number of elements in a set. For dimensional metrics, the set in question is the collection of unique maps of attributes observed for a given metric in a one-day period. You can query the cardinality of a metric in New Relic with the following NRQL format: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(metric.name) SINCE today RAW Copy For example, to query the cardinality of the metric memory.heap and find out how many unique key-value pairs exist for this metric, run the following query: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy Tip We recommend including the RAW clause in cardinality queries that use FROM Metric. This is because in the event your cardinality has been limited, queries like SINCE today will query rollups that are no longer reporting and so need to look at the raw data points to perform the necessary analysis. Note that because querying the raw data points over long time ranges can be slow, RAW queries spanning more than 2 days worth of data are not allowed. While the basics of what cardinality means can be simple to state, learning how to address and manage high cardinality can be a little more complicated. Cardinality limits and enforcement New Relic enforces limits on your metric cardinality both at the per-metric level and at the account level. Cardinality is evaluated over the course of a UTC day, starting at 00:00:00 UTC and ending at 23:59:59 UTC. For more information on data limits and related policies, see New Relic data usage limits and policies Cardinality and dimensional metrics The cardinality of a metric is the size of the set of unique maps of attributes observed for the given metric in a one-day period. If keys or values in that map change over time, they will add new cardinality for that metric. Let's see an example. Imagine a network of 4 hosts, each with 2 containers running on them, and each container periodically reports the gauge metric memory.heap, with the host name and container id added as attributes. When submitted to the Metric API, one of these metrics might look something like this: \"metrics\":[ { \"name\":\"memory.heap\", \"type\":\"gauge\", \"value\":5514, \"timestamp\":1234567890, \"attributes\":{ \"host\":\"W\", \"container\":\"1\" } } ] Copy This metric would then have a cardinality of 8, as that's how many unique mappings of host and container are possible. If a new measurement for this metric is taken with identical attributes as one that had previously reported, no new cardinality would be counted. Cardinality influences As shown above, any changes to the keys or values will represent new cardinality, but predicting how those changes will impact your total cardinality can get a little tricky. It's tempting to assume that the cardinality of a metric is then the product of the number of all possible values for each possible key, but this is rarely the case in practice, as the values a given key often depend on or determine the values of other keys. Using the previous example, once we had a container value of 1, the value of host was fixed to W, assuming those container IDs are globally unique. So while there are 8 containers across 4 hosts, the cardinality is still 8, not 4 * 8 = 32, since most combinations counted by the simple multiplication method are not possible and therefore don't contribute to that metric's cardinality. We will never see the combination of host = 'X', container = 1, for instance. This also means that adding more keys to an attributes map does not necessarily imply an increase to total cardinality. If the value of the new key is uniquely determined by the values of existing keys, it will not add new cardinality in the long term. For instance if you add something like region to your map in the example, it's likely the case that the container value is also fixed to a particular region value, and therefore keeps your cardinality at 8. An important caveat here is that while adding region won't increase the cardinality going forward, it will introduce new cardinality when it is first added. This is because adding keys will make those attribute maps distinct from any that came before them, temporarily increasing the total cardinality for that day. Examples and sample workflows If you hit one of your cardinality limits, there are a couple of options you can use to remedy the situation. One easy answer is increasing your limits, but if you would prefer not to do that, a good alternative is to explore which dimensions are contributing the most to your cardinality and think about removing them if they do not provide value. This can save storage and bandwidth costs and potentially prevent you needing to raise your limits. Find cardinality contributors: metrics Recall how to get the cardinality of a particular metric: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy For the total account cardinality, you can use the same basic query structure and simply omit the metric name: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW Copy The account's cardinality is essentially the sum of each metric's cardinality, so adding in a simple FACET query can help find the highest cardinality metrics: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW FACET metricName Copy Finally, if you believe you have hit one of your cardinality limits, you can confirm this by checking for a related NrIntegrationError: FROM NrIntegrationError SELECT count(*) where name = 'CardinalityViolationException' and newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' facet cardinalityLimitType, metricName, message since today Copy Finding cardinality contributors: dimensions Once you've determined a metric you want to explore, the next step is to determine which dimensions in a given metric contribute the most to its cardinality. If you are unfamiliar with the values of your dimensions, you can look at them like so: FROM Metric SELECT dimensions() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy The JSON results view will likely be advisable here. Looking through these could reveal some dimensions containing a unique ID or other highly variable value that might be worth removing. If you are already familiar with what values your attributes can take on, the keySet() results may be easier to scan: FROM Metric SELECT keySet() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy Understanding the dimensions that have the most influence on your total cardinality comes down to understanding how each key's values correlate with one another. You can experiment with what your cardinality would be without a dimension simply by adding it to the exclude list: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, exclude: {'container.id'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Likewise, there is an include list if that is more convenient to the query context: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, include: {'host.name', 'region'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Managing cardinality can be tricky to conceptualize, but the above methods will help you get answers to questions like \"What metric is contributing the most cardinality?\" and \"What impact does a given attribute(s) have to that total cardinality?\". It's often the case that cardinality tracks with the most unique value, as that value may pin down the possible values other attributes can take on. However, there are plenty of cases where the explosion of possible combinations of a handful of attributes drives the total cardinality. Things that look like unique identifiers are generally a good place to start, but sometimes it's no single key but the combination of two or more keys. The more familiar you are with your data and the systems that generate it, the easier it will be to know which attributes to include or exclude. Tip If you'd like to learn more about limits and troubleshooting the Metric API, here are two good resources: Metric API limits and restricted attributes Troubleshoot Metric API with NRIntegrationError events are both great resources to explore.",

Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), percentile(), average() or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute, and you can use the OR operator to facet results that don't match any of your specified cases. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy Facet non-matching data with OR This example uses the OR operator to facet results that didn't match any of your cases: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') OR name Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE r'z.*|q.*'' hostname RLIKE r'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' z-app q-app ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions In this section we explain NRQL functions, both aggregator functions and non-aggregator functions. Aggregator functions You can use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data. Some tips for using these: See New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. If you're using an aggregator function multiple times in the same query (for example, SELECT median(one_metric), median(another_metric)), it can cause problems in displaying results. To solve this, use the AS function. For example: `SELECT median(one_metric) as 'med-a', median(another_metric) as 'med-b'` Copy Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. For how to display results over time, see Group results over time. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in the same unit of time as the chosen attribute. For instance, if the attribute is measured in seconds, t will be a threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (that is, seconds 0 to 59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy capture(attribute, regular expression) Use the capture() to extract values from an attribute using a regular expression. Uses RE2 syntax. It takes two arguments: Attribute name Regular expression with capture syntax. Regex expressions in NRQL use Python-like syntax, r'...'. When capturing, use the RE2 named-capture syntax ...(?P<name> pattern )... to capture the contained pattern, given the specified name. Currently, only 1 capture group is supported. Please see the examples below. capture() within a SELECT clause condition The following will select the domain name of the website, removing https:// and any paths following the .com SELECT capture(pageUrl, r'https://(?P<baseUrl>.*.com)/.+') FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The following will capture only the first word of the error message. SELECT capture(errorMessage, r'(?P<firstWord>\\S+)\\s.+') FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago where errorMessage is not null Copy capture() within a FACET clause condition The following will facet by the captured HTTP method. SELECT count(*) FROM Log WHERE message like '%HTTP%' FACET capture(message, r'.* \"(?P<httpMethod>[A-Z]+) .*') Copy capture() within a WHERE clause condition The following will filter the results based on Log events with message attribute that matches the regular expression where the captured job name is ExampleJob. SELECT message FROM Log WHERE capture(message, r'.*Job Failed: (?P<jobName>[A-Za-z]+),.*') = 'ExampleJob' SINCE 10 minutes ago Copy capture() with a numeric cast The following will capture sum of CPU Time from log lines. You must explicitly cast to numeric to do mathematical operations. SELECT sum(numeric(capture(message, r'.*CpuTime:\\s(?P<cpuTime>\\d+)'))) FROM Log WHERE message like '%CpuTime:%' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. Ready to get started? If you haven't already, be sure to sign up for a New Relic account. It's free, forever. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by APM, browser, and mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the data explorer. Learn more about querying data in New Relic. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data from browser monitoring. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for browser monitoring PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "Understanding how high cardinality works is important, because it can impact how quickly you reach your data limits. What is cardinality and why does it matter? Cardinality is generally defined as the number of elements in a set. For dimensional metrics, the set in question is the collection of unique maps of attributes observed for a given metric in a one-day period. You can query the cardinality of a metric in New Relic with the following NRQL format: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(metric.name) SINCE today RAW Copy For example, to query the cardinality of the metric memory.heap and find out how many unique key-value pairs exist for this metric, run the following query: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy Tip We recommend including the RAW clause in cardinality queries that use FROM Metric. This is because in the event your cardinality has been limited, queries like SINCE today will query rollups that are no longer reporting and so need to look at the raw data points to perform the necessary analysis. Note that because querying the raw data points over long time ranges can be slow, RAW queries spanning more than 2 days worth of data are not allowed. While the basics of what cardinality means can be simple to state, learning how to address and manage high cardinality can be a little more complicated. Cardinality limits and enforcement New Relic enforces limits on your metric cardinality both at the per-metric level and at the account level. Cardinality is evaluated over the course of a UTC day, starting at 00:00:00 UTC and ending at 23:59:59 UTC. For more information on data limits and related policies, see New Relic data usage limits and policies Cardinality and dimensional metrics The cardinality of a metric is the size of the set of unique maps of attributes observed for the given metric in a one-day period. If keys or values in that map change over time, they will add new cardinality for that metric. Let's see an example. Imagine a network of 4 hosts, each with 2 containers running on them, and each container periodically reports the gauge metric memory.heap, with the host name and container id added as attributes. When submitted to the Metric API, one of these metrics might look something like this: \"metrics\":[ { \"name\":\"memory.heap\", \"type\":\"gauge\", \"value\":5514, \"timestamp\":1234567890, \"attributes\":{ \"host\":\"W\", \"container\":\"1\" } } ] Copy This metric would then have a cardinality of 8, as that's how many unique mappings of host and container are possible. If a new measurement for this metric is taken with identical attributes as one that had previously reported, no new cardinality would be counted. Cardinality influences As shown above, any changes to the keys or values will represent new cardinality, but predicting how those changes will impact your total cardinality can get a little tricky. It's tempting to assume that the cardinality of a metric is then the product of the number of all possible values for each possible key, but this is rarely the case in practice, as the values a given key often depend on or determine the values of other keys. Using the previous example, once we had a container value of 1, the value of host was fixed to W, assuming those container IDs are globally unique. So while there are 8 containers across 4 hosts, the cardinality is still 8, not 4 * 8 = 32, since most combinations counted by the simple multiplication method are not possible and therefore don't contribute to that metric's cardinality. We will never see the combination of host = 'X', container = 1, for instance. This also means that adding more keys to an attributes map does not necessarily imply an increase to total cardinality. If the value of the new key is uniquely determined by the values of existing keys, it will not add new cardinality in the long term. For instance if you add something like region to your map in the example, it's likely the case that the container value is also fixed to a particular region value, and therefore keeps your cardinality at 8. An important caveat here is that while adding region won't increase the cardinality going forward, it will introduce new cardinality when it is first added. This is because adding keys will make those attribute maps distinct from any that came before them, temporarily increasing the total cardinality for that day. Examples and sample workflows If you hit one of your cardinality limits, there are a couple of options you can use to remedy the situation. One easy answer is increasing your limits, but if you would prefer not to do that, a good alternative is to explore which dimensions are contributing the most to your cardinality and think about removing them if they do not provide value. This can save storage and bandwidth costs and potentially prevent you needing to raise your limits. Find cardinality contributors: metrics Recall how to get the cardinality of a particular metric: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy For the total account cardinality, you can use the same basic query structure and simply omit the metric name: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW Copy The account's cardinality is essentially the sum of each metric's cardinality, so adding in a simple FACET query can help find the highest cardinality metrics: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW FACET metricName Copy Finally, if you believe you have hit one of your cardinality limits, you can confirm this by checking for a related NrIntegrationError: FROM NrIntegrationError SELECT count(*) where name = 'CardinalityViolationException' and newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' facet cardinalityLimitType, metricName, message since today Copy Finding cardinality contributors: dimensions Once you've determined a metric you want to explore, the next step is to determine which dimensions in a given metric contribute the most to its cardinality. If you are unfamiliar with the values of your dimensions, you can look at them like so: FROM Metric SELECT dimensions() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy The JSON results view will likely be advisable here. Looking through these could reveal some dimensions containing a unique ID or other highly variable value that might be worth removing. If you are already familiar with what values your attributes can take on, the keySet() results may be easier to scan: FROM Metric SELECT keySet() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy Understanding the dimensions that have the most influence on your total cardinality comes down to understanding how each key's values correlate with one another. You can experiment with what your cardinality would be without a dimension simply by adding it to the exclude list: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, exclude: {'container.id'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Likewise, there is an include list if that is more convenient to the query context: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, include: {'host.name', 'region'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Managing cardinality can be tricky to conceptualize, but the above methods will help you get answers to questions like \"What metric is contributing the most cardinality?\" and \"What impact does a given attribute(s) have to that total cardinality?\". It's often the case that cardinality tracks with the most unique value, as that value may pin down the possible values other attributes can take on. However, there are plenty of cases where the explosion of possible combinations of a handful of attributes drives the total cardinality. Things that look like unique identifiers are generally a good place to start, but sometimes it's no single key but the combination of two or more keys. The more familiar you are with your data and the systems that generate it, the easier it will be to know which attributes to include or exclude. Tip If you'd like to learn more about limits and troubleshooting the Metric API, here are two good resources: Metric API limits and restricted attributes Troubleshoot Metric API with NRIntegrationError events are both great resources to explore.",

      "body": "NRQL is a query language you can use to query the New Relic database. This document explains NRQL syntax, clauses, components, and functions. Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), percentile(), average() or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute, and you can use the OR operator to facet results that don't match any of your specified cases. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy Facet non-matching data with OR This example uses the OR operator to facet results that didn't match any of your cases: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') OR name Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE r'z.*|q.*'' hostname RLIKE r'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' z-app q-app ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions In this section we explain NRQL functions, both aggregator functions and non-aggregator functions. Aggregator functions You can use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data. Some tips for using these: See New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. If you're using an aggregator function multiple times in the same query (for example, SELECT median(one_metric), median(another_metric)), it can cause problems in displaying results. To solve this, use the AS function. For example: `SELECT median(one_metric) as 'med-a', median(another_metric) as 'med-b'` Copy Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. For how to display results over time, see Group results over time. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in the same unit of time as the chosen attribute. For instance, if the attribute is measured in seconds, t will be a threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (that is, seconds 0 to 59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy capture(attribute, regular expression) Use the capture() to extract values from an attribute using a regular expression. Uses RE2 syntax. It takes two arguments: Attribute name Regular expression with capture syntax. Regex expressions in NRQL use Python-like syntax, r'...'. When capturing, use the RE2 named-capture syntax ...(?P<name> pattern )... to capture the contained pattern, given the specified name. Currently, only 1 capture group is supported. Please see the examples below. capture() within a SELECT clause condition The following will select the domain name of the website, removing https:// and any paths following the .com SELECT capture(pageUrl, r'https://(?P<baseUrl>.*.com)/.+') FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The following will capture only the first word of the error message. SELECT capture(errorMessage, r'(?P<firstWord>\\S+)\\s.+') FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago where errorMessage is not null Copy capture() within a FACET clause condition The following will facet by the captured HTTP method. SELECT count(*) FROM Log WHERE message like '%HTTP%' FACET capture(message, r'.* \"(?P<httpMethod>[A-Z]+) .*') Copy capture() within a WHERE clause condition The following will filter the results based on Log events with message attribute that matches the regular expression where the captured job name is ExampleJob. SELECT message FROM Log WHERE capture(message, r'.*Job Failed: (?P<jobName>[A-Za-z]+),.*') = 'ExampleJob' SINCE 10 minutes ago Copy capture() with a numeric cast The following will capture sum of CPU Time from log lines. You must explicitly cast to numeric to do mathematical operations. SELECT sum(numeric(capture(message, r'.*CpuTime:\\s(?P<cpuTime>\\d+)'))) FROM Log WHERE message like '%CpuTime:%' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. Ready to get started? If you haven't already, be sure to sign up for a New Relic account. It's free, forever. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by APM, browser, and mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the data explorer. Learn more about querying data in New Relic. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data from browser monitoring. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for browser monitoring PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "Understanding how high cardinality works is important, because it can impact how quickly you reach your data limits. What is cardinality and why does it matter? Cardinality is generally defined as the number of elements in a set. For dimensional metrics, the set in question is the collection of unique maps of attributes observed for a given metric in a one-day period. You can query the cardinality of a metric in New Relic with the following NRQL format: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(metric.name) SINCE today RAW Copy For example, to query the cardinality of the metric memory.heap and find out how many unique key-value pairs exist for this metric, run the following query: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy Tip We recommend including the RAW clause in cardinality queries that use FROM Metric. This is because in the event your cardinality has been limited, queries like SINCE today will query rollups that are no longer reporting and so need to look at the raw data points to perform the necessary analysis. Note that because querying the raw data points over long time ranges can be slow, RAW queries spanning more than 2 days worth of data are not allowed. While the basics of what cardinality means can be simple to state, learning how to address and manage high cardinality can be a little more complicated. Cardinality limits and enforcement New Relic enforces limits on your metric cardinality both at the per-metric level and at the account level. Cardinality is evaluated over the course of a UTC day, starting at 00:00:00 UTC and ending at 23:59:59 UTC. For more information on data limits and related policies, see New Relic data usage limits and policies Cardinality and dimensional metrics The cardinality of a metric is the size of the set of unique maps of attributes observed for the given metric in a one-day period. If keys or values in that map change over time, they will add new cardinality for that metric. Let's see an example. Imagine a network of 4 hosts, each with 2 containers running on them, and each container periodically reports the gauge metric memory.heap, with the host name and container id added as attributes. When submitted to the Metric API, one of these metrics might look something like this: \"metrics\":[ { \"name\":\"memory.heap\", \"type\":\"gauge\", \"value\":5514, \"timestamp\":1234567890, \"attributes\":{ \"host\":\"W\", \"container\":\"1\" } } ] Copy This metric would then have a cardinality of 8, as that's how many unique mappings of host and container are possible. If a new measurement for this metric is taken with identical attributes as one that had previously reported, no new cardinality would be counted. Cardinality influences As shown above, any changes to the keys or values will represent new cardinality, but predicting how those changes will impact your total cardinality can get a little tricky. It's tempting to assume that the cardinality of a metric is then the product of the number of all possible values for each possible key, but this is rarely the case in practice, as the values a given key often depend on or determine the values of other keys. Using the previous example, once we had a container value of 1, the value of host was fixed to W, assuming those container IDs are globally unique. So while there are 8 containers across 4 hosts, the cardinality is still 8, not 4 * 8 = 32, since most combinations counted by the simple multiplication method are not possible and therefore don't contribute to that metric's cardinality. We will never see the combination of host = 'X', container = 1, for instance. This also means that adding more keys to an attributes map does not necessarily imply an increase to total cardinality. If the value of the new key is uniquely determined by the values of existing keys, it will not add new cardinality in the long term. For instance if you add something like region to your map in the example, it's likely the case that the container value is also fixed to a particular region value, and therefore keeps your cardinality at 8. An important caveat here is that while adding region won't increase the cardinality going forward, it will introduce new cardinality when it is first added. This is because adding keys will make those attribute maps distinct from any that came before them, temporarily increasing the total cardinality for that day. Examples and sample workflows If you hit one of your cardinality limits, there are a couple of options you can use to remedy the situation. One easy answer is increasing your limits, but if you would prefer not to do that, a good alternative is to explore which dimensions are contributing the most to your cardinality and think about removing them if they do not provide value. This can save storage and bandwidth costs and potentially prevent you needing to raise your limits. Find cardinality contributors: metrics Recall how to get the cardinality of a particular metric: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy For the total account cardinality, you can use the same basic query structure and simply omit the metric name: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW Copy The account's cardinality is essentially the sum of each metric's cardinality, so adding in a simple FACET query can help find the highest cardinality metrics: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW FACET metricName Copy Finally, if you believe you have hit one of your cardinality limits, you can confirm this by checking for a related NrIntegrationError: FROM NrIntegrationError SELECT count(*) where name = 'CardinalityViolationException' and newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' facet cardinalityLimitType, metricName, message since today Copy Finding cardinality contributors: dimensions Once you've determined a metric you want to explore, the next step is to determine which dimensions in a given metric contribute the most to its cardinality. If you are unfamiliar with the values of your dimensions, you can look at them like so: FROM Metric SELECT dimensions() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy The JSON results view will likely be advisable here. Looking through these could reveal some dimensions containing a unique ID or other highly variable value that might be worth removing. If you are already familiar with what values your attributes can take on, the keySet() results may be easier to scan: FROM Metric SELECT keySet() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy Understanding the dimensions that have the most influence on your total cardinality comes down to understanding how each key's values correlate with one another. You can experiment with what your cardinality would be without a dimension simply by adding it to the exclude list: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, exclude: {'container.id'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Likewise, there is an include list if that is more convenient to the query context: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, include: {'host.name', 'region'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Managing cardinality can be tricky to conceptualize, but the above methods will help you get answers to questions like \"What metric is contributing the most cardinality?\" and \"What impact does a given attribute(s) have to that total cardinality?\". It's often the case that cardinality tracks with the most unique value, as that value may pin down the possible values other attributes can take on. However, there are plenty of cases where the explosion of possible combinations of a handful of attributes drives the total cardinality. Things that look like unique identifiers are generally a good place to start, but sometimes it's no single key but the combination of two or more keys. The more familiar you are with your data and the systems that generate it, the easier it will be to know which attributes to include or exclude. Tip If you'd like to learn more about limits and troubleshooting the Metric API, here are two good resources: Metric API limits and restricted attributes Troubleshoot Metric API with NRIntegrationError events are both great resources to explore.",

      "body": "NRQL is a query language you can use to query the New Relic database. This document explains NRQL syntax, clauses, components, and functions. Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), percentile(), average() or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute, and you can use the OR operator to facet results that don't match any of your specified cases. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy Facet non-matching data with OR This example uses the OR operator to facet results that didn't match any of your cases: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') OR name Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE r'z.*|q.*'' hostname RLIKE r'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' z-app q-app ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions In this section we explain NRQL functions, both aggregator functions and non-aggregator functions. Aggregator functions You can use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data. Some tips for using these: See New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. If you're using an aggregator function multiple times in the same query (for example, SELECT median(one_metric), median(another_metric)), it can cause problems in displaying results. To solve this, use the AS function. For example: `SELECT median(one_metric) as 'med-a', median(another_metric) as 'med-b'` Copy Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. For how to display results over time, see Group results over time. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in the same unit of time as the chosen attribute. For instance, if the attribute is measured in seconds, t will be a threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (that is, seconds 0 to 59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy capture(attribute, regular expression) Use the capture() to extract values from an attribute using a regular expression. Uses RE2 syntax. It takes two arguments: Attribute name Regular expression with capture syntax. Regex expressions in NRQL use Python-like syntax, r'...'. When capturing, use the RE2 named-capture syntax ...(?P<name> pattern )... to capture the contained pattern, given the specified name. Currently, only 1 capture group is supported. Please see the examples below. capture() within a SELECT clause condition The following will select the domain name of the website, removing https:// and any paths following the .com SELECT capture(pageUrl, r'https://(?P<baseUrl>.*.com)/.+') FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The following will capture only the first word of the error message. SELECT capture(errorMessage, r'(?P<firstWord>\\S+)\\s.+') FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago where errorMessage is not null Copy capture() within a FACET clause condition The following will facet by the captured HTTP method. SELECT count(*) FROM Log WHERE message like '%HTTP%' FACET capture(message, r'.* \"(?P<httpMethod>[A-Z]+) .*') Copy capture() within a WHERE clause condition The following will filter the results based on Log events with message attribute that matches the regular expression where the captured job name is ExampleJob. SELECT message FROM Log WHERE capture(message, r'.*Job Failed: (?P<jobName>[A-Za-z]+),.*') = 'ExampleJob' SINCE 10 minutes ago Copy capture() with a numeric cast The following will capture sum of CPU Time from log lines. You must explicitly cast to numeric to do mathematical operations. SELECT sum(numeric(capture(message, r'.*CpuTime:\\s(?P<cpuTime>\\d+)'))) FROM Log WHERE message like '%CpuTime:%' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. Ready to get started? If you haven't already, be sure to sign up for a New Relic account. It's free, forever. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by APM, browser, and mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the data explorer. Learn more about querying data in New Relic. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data from browser monitoring. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for browser monitoring PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "Understanding how high cardinality works is important, because it can impact how quickly you reach your data limits. What is cardinality and why does it matter? Cardinality is generally defined as the number of elements in a set. For dimensional metrics, the set in question is the collection of unique maps of attributes observed for a given metric in a one-day period. You can query the cardinality of a metric in New Relic with the following NRQL format: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(metric.name) SINCE today RAW Copy For example, to query the cardinality of the metric memory.heap and find out how many unique key-value pairs exist for this metric, run the following query: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy Tip We recommend including the RAW clause in cardinality queries that use FROM Metric. This is because in the event your cardinality has been limited, queries like SINCE today will query rollups that are no longer reporting and so need to look at the raw data points to perform the necessary analysis. Note that because querying the raw data points over long time ranges can be slow, RAW queries spanning more than 2 days worth of data are not allowed. While the basics of what cardinality means can be simple to state, learning how to address and manage high cardinality can be a little more complicated. Cardinality limits and enforcement New Relic enforces limits on your metric cardinality both at the per-metric level and at the account level. Cardinality is evaluated over the course of a UTC day, starting at 00:00:00 UTC and ending at 23:59:59 UTC. For more information on data limits and related policies, see New Relic data usage limits and policies Cardinality and dimensional metrics The cardinality of a metric is the size of the set of unique maps of attributes observed for the given metric in a one-day period. If keys or values in that map change over time, they will add new cardinality for that metric. Let's see an example. Imagine a network of 4 hosts, each with 2 containers running on them, and each container periodically reports the gauge metric memory.heap, with the host name and container id added as attributes. When submitted to the Metric API, one of these metrics might look something like this: \"metrics\":[ { \"name\":\"memory.heap\", \"type\":\"gauge\", \"value\":5514, \"timestamp\":1234567890, \"attributes\":{ \"host\":\"W\", \"container\":\"1\" } } ] Copy This metric would then have a cardinality of 8, as that's how many unique mappings of host and container are possible. If a new measurement for this metric is taken with identical attributes as one that had previously reported, no new cardinality would be counted. Cardinality influences As shown above, any changes to the keys or values will represent new cardinality, but predicting how those changes will impact your total cardinality can get a little tricky. It's tempting to assume that the cardinality of a metric is then the product of the number of all possible values for each possible key, but this is rarely the case in practice, as the values a given key often depend on or determine the values of other keys. Using the previous example, once we had a container value of 1, the value of host was fixed to W, assuming those container IDs are globally unique. So while there are 8 containers across 4 hosts, the cardinality is still 8, not 4 * 8 = 32, since most combinations counted by the simple multiplication method are not possible and therefore don't contribute to that metric's cardinality. We will never see the combination of host = 'X', container = 1, for instance. This also means that adding more keys to an attributes map does not necessarily imply an increase to total cardinality. If the value of the new key is uniquely determined by the values of existing keys, it will not add new cardinality in the long term. For instance if you add something like region to your map in the example, it's likely the case that the container value is also fixed to a particular region value, and therefore keeps your cardinality at 8. An important caveat here is that while adding region won't increase the cardinality going forward, it will introduce new cardinality when it is first added. This is because adding keys will make those attribute maps distinct from any that came before them, temporarily increasing the total cardinality for that day. Examples and sample workflows If you hit one of your cardinality limits, there are a couple of options you can use to remedy the situation. One easy answer is increasing your limits, but if you would prefer not to do that, a good alternative is to explore which dimensions are contributing the most to your cardinality and think about removing them if they do not provide value. This can save storage and bandwidth costs and potentially prevent you needing to raise your limits. Find cardinality contributors: metrics Recall how to get the cardinality of a particular metric: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy For the total account cardinality, you can use the same basic query structure and simply omit the metric name: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW Copy The account's cardinality is essentially the sum of each metric's cardinality, so adding in a simple FACET query can help find the highest cardinality metrics: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW FACET metricName Copy Finally, if you believe you have hit one of your cardinality limits, you can confirm this by checking for a related NrIntegrationError: FROM NrIntegrationError SELECT count(*) where name = 'CardinalityViolationException' and newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' facet cardinalityLimitType, metricName, message since today Copy Finding cardinality contributors: dimensions Once you've determined a metric you want to explore, the next step is to determine which dimensions in a given metric contribute the most to its cardinality. If you are unfamiliar with the values of your dimensions, you can look at them like so: FROM Metric SELECT dimensions() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy The JSON results view will likely be advisable here. Looking through these could reveal some dimensions containing a unique ID or other highly variable value that might be worth removing. If you are already familiar with what values your attributes can take on, the keySet() results may be easier to scan: FROM Metric SELECT keySet() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy Understanding the dimensions that have the most influence on your total cardinality comes down to understanding how each key's values correlate with one another. You can experiment with what your cardinality would be without a dimension simply by adding it to the exclude list: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, exclude: {'container.id'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Likewise, there is an include list if that is more convenient to the query context: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, include: {'host.name', 'region'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Managing cardinality can be tricky to conceptualize, but the above methods will help you get answers to questions like \"What metric is contributing the most cardinality?\" and \"What impact does a given attribute(s) have to that total cardinality?\". It's often the case that cardinality tracks with the most unique value, as that value may pin down the possible values other attributes can take on. However, there are plenty of cases where the explosion of possible combinations of a handful of attributes drives the total cardinality. Things that look like unique identifiers are generally a good place to start, but sometimes it's no single key but the combination of two or more keys. The more familiar you are with your data and the systems that generate it, the easier it will be to know which attributes to include or exclude.

      "body": "NRQL is a query language you can use to query the New Relic database. This document explains NRQL syntax, clauses, components, and functions. Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), percentile(), average() or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute, and you can use the OR operator to facet results that don't match any of your specified cases. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy Facet non-matching data with OR This example uses the OR operator to facet results that didn't match any of your cases: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') OR name Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE r'z.*|q.*'' hostname RLIKE r'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' z-app q-app ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions In this section we explain NRQL functions, both aggregator functions and non-aggregator functions. Aggregator functions You can use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data. Some tips for using these: See New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. If you're using an aggregator function multiple times in the same query (for example, SELECT median(one_metric), median(another_metric)), it can cause problems in displaying results. To solve this, use the AS function. For example: `SELECT median(one_metric) as 'med-a', median(another_metric) as 'med-b'` Copy Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. For how to display results over time, see Group results over time. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in the same unit of time as the chosen attribute. For instance, if the attribute is measured in seconds, t will be a threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (that is, seconds 0 to 59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy capture(attribute, regular expression) Use the capture() to extract values from an attribute using a regular expression. Uses RE2 syntax. It takes two arguments: Attribute name Regular expression with capture syntax. Regex expressions in NRQL use Python-like syntax, r'...'. When capturing, use the RE2 named-capture syntax ...(?P<name> pattern )... to capture the contained pattern, given the specified name. Currently, only 1 capture group is supported. Please see the examples below. capture() within a SELECT clause condition The following will select the domain name of the website, removing https:// and any paths following the .com SELECT capture(pageUrl, r'https://(?P<baseUrl>.*.com)/.+') FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The following will capture only the first word of the error message. SELECT capture(errorMessage, r'(?P<firstWord>\\S+)\\s.+') FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago where errorMessage is not null Copy capture() within a FACET clause condition The following will facet by the captured HTTP method. SELECT count(*) FROM Log WHERE message like '%HTTP%' FACET capture(message, r'.* \"(?P<httpMethod>[A-Z]+) .*') Copy capture() within a WHERE clause condition The following will filter the results based on Log events with message attribute that matches the regular expression where the captured job name is ExampleJob. SELECT message FROM Log WHERE capture(message, r'.*Job Failed: (?P<jobName>[A-Za-z]+),.*') = 'ExampleJob' SINCE 10 minutes ago Copy capture() with a numeric cast The following will capture sum of CPU Time from log lines. You must explicitly cast to numeric to do mathematical operations. SELECT sum(numeric(capture(message, r'.*CpuTime:\\s(?P<cpuTime>\\d+)'))) FROM Log WHERE message like '%CpuTime:%' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. Ready to get started? If you haven't already, be sure to sign up for a New Relic account. It's free, forever. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by APM, browser, and mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the data explorer. Learn more about querying data in New Relic. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data from browser monitoring. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for browser monitoring PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "Understanding how high cardinality works is important, because it can impact how quickly you reach your data limits. What is cardinality and why does it matter? Cardinality is generally defined as the number of elements in a set. For dimensional metrics, the set in question is the collection of unique maps of attributes observed for a given metric in a one-day period. You can query the cardinality of a metric in New Relic with the following NRQL format: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(metric.name) SINCE today RAW Copy For example, to query the cardinality of the metric memory.heap and find out how many unique key-value pairs exist for this metric, run the following query: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy Tip We recommend including the RAW clause in cardinality queries that use FROM Metric. This is because in the event your cardinality has been limited, queries like SINCE today will query rollups that are no longer reporting and so need to look at the raw data points to perform the necessary analysis. Note that because querying the raw data points over long time ranges can be slow, RAW queries spanning more than 2 days worth of data are not allowed. While the basics of what cardinality means can be simple to state, learning how to address and manage high cardinality can be a little more complicated. Cardinality limits and enforcement New Relic enforces limits on your metric cardinality both at the per-metric level and at the account level. Cardinality is evaluated over the course of a UTC day, starting at 00:00:00 UTC and ending at 23:59:59 UTC. For more information on data limits and related policies, see New Relic data usage limits and policies Cardinality and dimensional metrics The cardinality of a metric is the size of the set of unique maps of attributes observed for the given metric in a one-day period. If keys or values in that map change over time, they will add new cardinality for that metric. Let's see an example. Imagine a network of 4 hosts, each with 2 containers running on them, and each container periodically reports the gauge metric memory.heap, with the host name and container id added as attributes. When submitted to the Metric API, one of these metrics might look something like this: \"metrics\":[ { \"name\":\"memory.heap\", \"type\":\"gauge\", \"value\":5514, \"timestamp\":1234567890, \"attributes\":{ \"host\":\"W\", \"container\":\"1\" } } ] Copy This metric would then have a cardinality of 8, as that's how many unique mappings of host and container are possible. If a new measurement for this metric is taken with identical attributes as one that had previously reported, no new cardinality would be counted. Cardinality influences As shown above, any changes to the keys or values will represent new cardinality, but predicting how those changes will impact your total cardinality can get a little tricky. It's tempting to assume that the cardinality of a metric is then the product of the number of all possible values for each possible key, but this is rarely the case in practice, as the values a given key often depend on or determine the values of other keys. Using the previous example, once we had a container value of 1, the value of host was fixed to W, assuming those container IDs are globally unique. So while there are 8 containers across 4 hosts, the cardinality is still 8, not 4 * 8 = 32, since most combinations counted by the simple multiplication method are not possible and therefore don't contribute to that metric's cardinality. We will never see the combination of host = 'X', container = 1, for instance. This also means that adding more keys to an attributes map does not necessarily imply an increase to total cardinality. If the value of the new key is uniquely determined by the values of existing keys, it will not add new cardinality in the long term. For instance if you add something like region to your map in the example, it's likely the case that the container value is also fixed to a particular region value, and therefore keeps your cardinality at 8. An important caveat here is that while adding region won't increase the cardinality going forward, it will introduce new cardinality when it is first added. This is because adding keys will make those attribute maps distinct from any that came before them, temporarily increasing the total cardinality for that day. Examples and sample workflows If you hit one of your cardinality limits, there are a couple of options you can use to remedy the situation. One easy answer is increasing your limits, but if you would prefer not to do that, a good alternative is to explore which dimensions are contributing the most to your cardinality and think about removing them if they do not provide value. This can save storage and bandwidth costs and potentially prevent you needing to raise your limits. Find cardinality contributors: metrics Recall how to get the cardinality of a particular metric: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy For the total account cardinality, you can use the same basic query structure and simply omit the metric name: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW Copy The account's cardinality is essentially the sum of each metric's cardinality, so adding in a simple FACET query can help find the highest cardinality metrics: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW FACET metricName Copy Finally, if you believe you have hit one of your cardinality limits, you can confirm this by checking for a related NrIntegrationError: FROM NrIntegrationError SELECT count(*) where name = 'CardinalityViolationException' and newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' facet cardinalityLimitType, metricName, message since today Copy Finding cardinality contributors: dimensions Once you've determined a metric you want to explore, the next step is to determine which dimensions in a given metric contribute the most to its cardinality. If you are unfamiliar with the values of your dimensions, you can look at them like so: FROM Metric SELECT dimensions() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy The JSON results view will likely be advisable here. Looking through these could reveal some dimensions containing a unique ID or other highly variable value that might be worth removing. If you are already familiar with what values your attributes can take on, the keySet() results may be easier to scan: FROM Metric SELECT keySet() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy Understanding the dimensions that have the most influence on your total cardinality comes down to understanding how each key's values correlate with one another. You can experiment with what your cardinality would be without a dimension simply by adding it to the exclude list: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, exclude: {'container.id'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Likewise, there is an include list if that is more convenient to the query context: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, include: {'host.name', 'region'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Managing cardinality can be tricky to conceptualize, but the above methods will help you get answers to questions like \"What metric is contributing the most cardinality?\" and \"What impact does a given attribute(s) have to that total cardinality?\". It's often the case that cardinality tracks with the most unique value, as that value may pin down the possible values other attributes can take on. However, there are plenty of cases where the explosion of possible combinations of a handful of attributes drives the total cardinality. Things that look like unique identifiers are generally a good place to start, but sometimes it's no single key but the combination of two or more keys. The more familiar you are with your data and the systems that generate it, the easier it will be to know which attributes to include or exclude. Tip If you'd like to learn more about limits and troubleshooting the Metric API, here are two good resources: Metric API limits and restricted attributes Troubleshoot Metric API with NRIntegrationError events are both great resources to explore.",

All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), percentile(), average() or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute, and you can use the OR operator to facet results that don't match any of your specified cases. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy Facet non-matching data with OR This example uses the OR operator to facet results that didn't match any of your cases: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') OR name Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE r'z.*|q.*'' hostname RLIKE r'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' z-app q-app ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions In this section we explain NRQL functions, both aggregator functions and non-aggregator functions. Aggregator functions You can use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data. Some tips for using these: See New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. If you're using an aggregator function multiple times in the same query (for example, SELECT median(one_metric), median(another_metric)), it can cause problems in displaying results. To solve this, use the AS function. For example: `SELECT median(one_metric) as 'med-a', median(another_metric) as 'med-b'` Copy Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. For how to display results over time, see Group results over time. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in the same unit of time as the chosen attribute. For instance, if the attribute is measured in seconds, t will be a threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (that is, seconds 0 to 59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy capture(attribute, regular expression) Use the capture() to extract values from an attribute using a regular expression. Uses RE2 syntax. It takes two arguments: Attribute name Regular expression with capture syntax. Regex expressions in NRQL use Python-like syntax, r'...'. When capturing, use the RE2 named-capture syntax ...(?P<name> pattern )... to capture the contained pattern, given the specified name. Currently, only 1 capture group is supported. Please see the examples below. capture() within a SELECT clause condition The following will select the domain name of the website, removing https:// and any paths following the .com SELECT capture(pageUrl, r'https://(?P<baseUrl>.*.com)/.+') FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The following will capture only the first word of the error message. SELECT capture(errorMessage, r'(?P<firstWord>\\S+)\\s.+') FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago where errorMessage is not null Copy capture() within a FACET clause condition The following will facet by the captured HTTP method. SELECT count(*) FROM Log WHERE message like '%HTTP%' FACET capture(message, r'.* \"(?P<httpMethod>[A-Z]+) .*') Copy capture() within a WHERE clause condition The following will filter the results based on Log events with message attribute that matches the regular expression where the captured job name is ExampleJob. SELECT message FROM Log WHERE capture(message, r'.*Job Failed: (?P<jobName>[A-Za-z]+),.*') = 'ExampleJob' SINCE 10 minutes ago Copy capture() with a numeric cast The following will capture sum of CPU Time from log lines. You must explicitly cast to numeric to do mathematical operations. SELECT sum(numeric(capture(message, r'.*CpuTime:\\s(?P<cpuTime>\\d+)'))) FROM Log WHERE message like '%CpuTime:%' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. Ready to get started? If you haven't already, be sure to sign up for a New Relic account. It's free, forever. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by APM, browser, and mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the data explorer. Learn more about querying data in New Relic. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data from browser monitoring. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for browser monitoring PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement. JOIN functions NRQL does not have the equivalent of the SQL JOIN function, but you can simulate a JOIN with custom attributes. Read more about NRQL syntax and functions.",

      "body": "Summary New Relic released Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.57 on 2021-12-14 to address critical vulnerabilities CVE 2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 in the open source Apache Log4j framework. A malicious actor may be able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. New Relic also released Helm Charts version 1.0.45 on 2021-12-14 to address CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Helm Charts version 1.0.45 contains the CPM version 3.0.57. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-04 Priority: Critical Affected software Versions affected: All supported containerized private minion (CPM) versions prior to 3.0.57 Fixed version: 3.0.57, also available through Helm Charts version 1.0.45 New Relic CPM version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-45046 Severity: Critical CVSS 9.0 3.0.57 yes yes If you use Helm Charts to update your CPM configurations, you will want to implement New Relic Helm Charts version 1.0.45. This will update your CPM to version 3.0.57. Action items To remediate CVE-2021-44228 in the New Relic Containerized Private Minion, we recommend customers upgrade to version 3.0.57 as soon as possible. This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.16.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.45. Important If you have already upgraded to Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.55, Apache Foundation's current technical guidance is that your CPM has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We strongly recommend updating to CPM version 3.0.57 at this time. This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to NR21-03 for more information. Customers using log4j directly in their applications should carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities page for remediation details that should be considered. Vulnerability information A high level vulnerability was publicly disclosed for the log4j framework on 2021-12-09. An attacker is able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters.

      "body": "Summary New Relic has released Java agents 6.5.1 and 7.4.1 to address a critical vulnerability in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. A newer Java agent, 7.4.2, is also available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046, a lower severity issue in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 14, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement one of the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? To see agent version information, go to your Environment page in New Relic One. See our environment documentation for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x, and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already. Do I need to update to 7.4.2? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java Agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. Publication history December 14, 2021: NR21-03 Major Revision: New fix version 7.4.2 available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Updated to include an additional workaround option. Updated to provide clarity between New Relic Java agent updates and the best practices customers should take to secure their applications. Added technical vulnerability descriptions and CVSS scores from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). December 13, 2021: NR21-03 updated to include more explicit workaround guidance and FAQs December 10, 2021: NR21-03 published Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data.

This will update your CPM to version 3.0.57. Action items To remediate CVE-2021-44228 in the New Relic Containerized Private Minion, we recommend customers upgrade to version 3.0.57 as soon as possible. This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.16.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.45. Important If you have already upgraded to Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.55, Apache Foundation's current technical guidance is that your CPM has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We strongly recommend updating to CPM version 3.0.57 at this time. This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to NR21-03 for more information. Customers using log4j directly in their applications should carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities page for remediation details that should be considered. Vulnerability information A high level vulnerability was publicly disclosed for the log4j framework on 2021-12-09.

Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement one of the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? To see agent version information, go to your Environment page in New Relic One. See our environment documentation for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x, and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already. Do I need to update to 7.4.2? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java Agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. Publication history December 14, 2021: NR21-03 Major Revision: New fix version 7.4.2 available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Updated to include an additional workaround option.

This will update your CPM to version 3.0.57. Action items To remediate CVE-2021-44228 in the New Relic Containerized Private Minion, we recommend customers upgrade to version 3.0.57 as soon as possible. This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.16.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.45. Important If you have already upgraded to Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.55, Apache Foundation's current technical guidance is that your CPM has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We strongly recommend updating to CPM version 3.0.57 at this time. This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to NR21-03 for more information. Customers using log4j directly in their applications should carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities page for remediation details that should be considered.

      "body": "Summary New Relic has released Java agents 6.5.1 and 7.4.1 to address a critical vulnerability in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. A newer Java agent, 7.4.2, is also available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046, a lower severity issue in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 14, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement one of the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? To see agent version information, go to your Environment page in New Relic One. See our environment documentation for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x, and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already. Do I need to update to 7.4.2? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228).

A malicious actor may be able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. New Relic also released Helm Charts version 1.0.45 on 2021-12-14 to address CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Helm Charts version 1.0.45 contains the CPM version 3.0.57. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-04 Priority: Critical Affected software Versions affected: All supported containerized private minion (CPM) versions prior to 3.0.57 Fixed version: 3.0.57, also available through Helm Charts version 1.0.45 New Relic CPM version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-45046 Severity: Critical CVSS 9.0 3.0.57 yes yes If you use Helm Charts to update your CPM configurations, you will want to implement New Relic Helm Charts version 1.0.45. This will update your CPM to version 3.0.57. Action items To remediate CVE-2021-44228 in the New Relic Containerized Private Minion, we recommend customers upgrade to version 3.0.57 as soon as possible. This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.16.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.45. Important If you have already upgraded to Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.55, Apache Foundation's current technical guidance is that your CPM has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We strongly recommend updating to CPM version 3.0.57 at this time. This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to NR21-03 for more information. Customers using log4j directly in their applications should carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities page for remediation details that should be considered. Vulnerability information A high level vulnerability was publicly disclosed for the log4j framework on 2021-12-09. An attacker is able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. CVE-2021-44228 CVSS 10.0 CVE-2021-45046 CVSS 9.0 Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions I've updated to CPM 3.0.55 already. Do I need to update to 3.0.57? Apache Foundation and NIST have revised their technical assessment of CVE-2021-44228 and advise that log4j v2.15.0 is not sufficient protection against exploitation. CPM 3.0.57 and later versions are the only CPM versions available with log4j 2.16.0.

      "body": "Summary New Relic has released Java agents 6.5.1 and 7.4.1 to address a critical vulnerability in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. A newer Java agent, 7.4.2, is also available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046, a lower severity issue in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 14, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement one of the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? To see agent version information, go to your Environment page in New Relic One. See our environment documentation for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x, and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already. Do I need to update to 7.4.2? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java Agent at this time.

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

A malicious actor may be able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. New Relic also released Helm Charts version 1.0.45 on 2021-12-14 to address CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Helm Charts version 1.0.45 contains the CPM version 3.0.57. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-04 Priority: Critical Affected software Versions affected: All supported containerized private minion (CPM) versions prior to 3.0.57 Fixed version: 3.0.57, also available through Helm Charts version 1.0.45 New Relic CPM version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-45046 Severity: Critical CVSS 9.0 3.0.57 yes yes If you use Helm Charts to update your CPM configurations, you will want to implement New Relic Helm Charts version 1.0.45. This will update your CPM to version 3.0.57. Action items To remediate CVE-2021-44228 in the New Relic Containerized Private Minion, we recommend customers upgrade to version 3.0.57 as soon as possible. This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.16.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.45. Important If you have already upgraded to Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.55, Apache Foundation's current technical guidance is that your CPM has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We strongly recommend updating to CPM version 3.0.57 at this time. This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to NR21-03 for more information. Customers using log4j directly in their applications should carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities page for remediation details that should be considered. Vulnerability information A high level vulnerability was publicly disclosed for the log4j framework on 2021-12-09. An attacker is able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. CVE-2021-44228 CVSS 10.0 CVE-2021-45046 CVSS 9.0 Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions I've updated to CPM 3.0.55 already. Do I need to update to 3.0.57? Apache Foundation and NIST have revised their technical assessment of CVE-2021-44228 and advise that log4j v2.15.0 is not sufficient protection against exploitation. CPM 3.0.57 and later versions are the only CPM versions available with log4j 2.16.0.

      "body": "Summary New Relic has released Java agents 6.5.1 and 7.4.1 to address a critical vulnerability in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. A newer Java agent, 7.4.2, is also available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046, a lower severity issue in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 14, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement one of the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? To see agent version information, go to your Environment page in New Relic One. See our environment documentation for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x, and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already. Do I need to update to 7.4.2? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java Agent at this time.

A malicious actor may be able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. New Relic also released Helm Charts version 1.0.45 on 2021-12-14 to address CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Helm Charts version 1.0.45 contains the CPM version 3.0.57. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-04 Priority: Critical Affected software Versions affected: All supported containerized private minion (CPM) versions prior to 3.0.57 Fixed version: 3.0.57, also available through Helm Charts version 1.0.45 New Relic CPM version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-45046 Severity: Critical CVSS 9.0 3.0.57 yes yes If you use Helm Charts to update your CPM configurations, you will want to implement New Relic Helm Charts version 1.0.45. This will update your CPM to version 3.0.57. Action items To remediate CVE-2021-44228 in the New Relic Containerized Private Minion, we recommend customers upgrade to version 3.0.57 as soon as possible. This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.16.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.45. Important If you have already upgraded to Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.55, Apache Foundation's current technical guidance is that your CPM has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We strongly recommend updating to CPM version 3.0.57 at this time. This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to NR21-03 for more information. Customers using log4j directly in their applications should carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities page for remediation details that should be considered. Vulnerability information A high level vulnerability was publicly disclosed for the log4j framework on 2021-12-09. An attacker is able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. CVE-2021-44228 CVSS 10.0 CVE-2021-45046 CVSS 9.0 Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions I've updated to CPM 3.0.55 already. Do I need to update to 3.0.57? Apache Foundation and NIST have revised their technical assessment of CVE-2021-44228 and advise that log4j v2.15.0 is not sufficient protection against exploitation. CPM 3.0.57 and later versions are the only CPM versions available with log4j 2.16.0.

      "body": "Summary New Relic has released Java agents 6.5.1 and 7.4.1 to address a critical vulnerability in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. A newer Java agent, 7.4.2, is also available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046, a lower severity issue in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 14, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement one of the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? To see agent version information, go to your Environment page in New Relic One. See our environment documentation for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x, and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already. Do I need to update to 7.4.2? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java Agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible.

This will update your CPM to version 3.0.57. Action items To remediate CVE-2021-44228 in the New Relic Containerized Private Minion, we recommend customers upgrade to version 3.0.57 as soon as possible. This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.16.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.45. Important If you have already upgraded to Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.55, Apache Foundation's current technical guidance is that your CPM has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We strongly recommend updating to CPM version 3.0.57 at this time. This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to NR21-03 for more information. Customers using log4j directly in their applications should carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities page for remediation details that should be considered. Vulnerability information A high level vulnerability was publicly disclosed for the log4j framework on 2021-12-09.

      "body": "Summary New Relic has released Java agents 6.5.1 and 7.4.1 to address a critical vulnerability in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. A newer Java agent, 7.4.2, is also available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046, a lower severity issue in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 14, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement one of the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? To see agent version information, go to your Environment page in New Relic One. See our environment documentation for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x, and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already. Do I need to update to 7.4.2? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java Agent at this time.

      "body": "Summary New Relic has released Java agents 6.5.1 and 7.4.1 to address a critical vulnerability in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. A newer Java agent, 7.4.2, is also available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046, a lower severity issue in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 14, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement one of the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? To see agent version information, go to your Environment page in New Relic One. See our environment documentation for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x, and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already. Do I need to update to 7.4.2? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java Agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. Publication history December 14, 2021: NR21-03 Major Revision: New fix version 7.4.2 available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Updated to include an additional workaround option. Updated to provide clarity between New Relic Java agent updates and the best practices customers should take to secure their applications. Added technical vulnerability descriptions and CVSS scores from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

A malicious actor may be able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. New Relic also released Helm Charts version 1.0.45 on 2021-12-14 to address CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Helm Charts version 1.0.45 contains the CPM version 3.0.57. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-04 Priority: Critical Affected software Versions affected: All supported containerized private minion (CPM) versions prior to 3.0.57 Fixed version: 3.0.57, also available through Helm Charts version 1.0.45 New Relic CPM version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-45046 Severity: Critical CVSS 9.0 3.0.57 yes yes If you use Helm Charts to update your CPM configurations, you will want to implement New Relic Helm Charts version 1.0.45. This will update your CPM to version 3.0.57. Action items To remediate CVE-2021-44228 in the New Relic Containerized Private Minion, we recommend customers upgrade to version 3.0.57 as soon as possible. This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.16.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.45. Important If you have already upgraded to Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.55, Apache Foundation's current technical guidance is that your CPM has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We strongly recommend updating to CPM version 3.0.57 at this time. This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to NR21-03 for more information. Customers using log4j directly in their applications should carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities page for remediation details that should be considered. Vulnerability information A high level vulnerability was publicly disclosed for the log4j framework on 2021-12-09.

      "body": "Summary New Relic has released Java agents 6.5.1 and 7.4.1 to address a critical vulnerability in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. A newer Java agent, 7.4.2, is also available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046, a lower severity issue in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 14, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement one of the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? To see agent version information, go to your Environment page in New Relic One. See our environment documentation for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x, and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already. Do I need to update to 7.4.2? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java Agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. Publication history December 14, 2021: NR21-03 Major Revision: New fix version 7.4.2 available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Updated to include an additional workaround option. Updated to provide clarity between New Relic Java agent updates and the best practices customers should take to secure their applications. Added technical vulnerability descriptions and CVSS scores from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

This will update your CPM to version 3.0.57. Action items To remediate CVE-2021-44228 in the New Relic Containerized Private Minion, we recommend customers upgrade to version 3.0.57 as soon as possible. This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.16.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.45. Important If you have already upgraded to Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.55, Apache Foundation's current technical guidance is that your CPM has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We strongly recommend updating to CPM version 3.0.57 at this time. This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to NR21-03 for more information. Customers using log4j directly in their applications should carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities page for remediation details that should be considered.

A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement one of the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? To see agent version information, go to your Environment page in New Relic One. See our environment documentation for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x, and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already. Do I need to update to 7.4.2? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java Agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. Publication history December 14, 2021: NR21-03 Major Revision: New fix version 7.4.2 available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Updated to include an additional workaround option. Updated to provide clarity between New Relic Java agent updates and the best practices customers should take to secure their applications. Added technical vulnerability descriptions and CVSS scores from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

A malicious actor may be able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. New Relic also released Helm Charts version 1.0.45 on 2021-12-14 to address CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Helm Charts version 1.0.45 contains the CPM version 3.0.57. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-04 Priority: Critical Affected software Versions affected: All supported containerized private minion (CPM) versions prior to 3.0.57 Fixed version: 3.0.57, also available through Helm Charts version 1.0.45 New Relic CPM version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-45046 Severity: Critical CVSS 9.0 3.0.57 yes yes If you use Helm Charts to update your CPM configurations, you will want to implement New Relic Helm Charts version 1.0.45. This will update your CPM to version 3.0.57. Action items To remediate CVE-2021-44228 in the New Relic Containerized Private Minion, we recommend customers upgrade to version 3.0.57 as soon as possible. This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.16.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.45. Important If you have already upgraded to Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.55, Apache Foundation's current technical guidance is that your CPM has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We strongly recommend updating to CPM version 3.0.57 at this time. This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to NR21-03 for more information. Customers using log4j directly in their applications should carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities page for remediation details that should be considered. Vulnerability information A high level vulnerability was publicly disclosed for the log4j framework on 2021-12-09.

      "body": "Summary New Relic has released Java agents 6.5.1 and 7.4.1 to address a critical vulnerability in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. A newer Java agent, 7.4.2, is also available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046, a lower severity issue in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 14, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information.

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "Summary New Relic released Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.57 on 2021-12-14 to address critical vulnerabilities CVE 2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 in the open source Apache Log4j framework. A malicious actor may be able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. New Relic also released Helm Charts version 1.0.45 on 2021-12-14 to address CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Helm Charts version 1.0.45 contains the CPM version 3.0.57. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-04 Priority: Critical Affected software Versions affected: All supported containerized private minion (CPM) versions prior to 3.0.57 Fixed version: 3.0.57, also available through Helm Charts version 1.0.45 New Relic CPM version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-45046 Severity: Critical CVSS 9.0 3.0.57 yes yes If you use Helm Charts to update your CPM configurations, you will want to implement New Relic Helm Charts version 1.0.45. This will update your CPM to version 3.0.57. Action items To remediate CVE-2021-44228 in the New Relic Containerized Private Minion, we recommend customers upgrade to version 3.0.57 as soon as possible. This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.16.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.45. Important If you have already upgraded to Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.55, Apache Foundation's current technical guidance is that your CPM has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We strongly recommend updating to CPM version 3.0.57 at this time. This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to NR21-03 for more information. Customers using log4j directly in their applications should carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities page for remediation details that should be considered. Vulnerability information A high level vulnerability was publicly disclosed for the log4j framework on 2021-12-09. An attacker is able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. CVE-2021-44228 CVSS 10.0 CVE-2021-45046 CVSS 9.0 Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions I've updated to CPM 3.0.55 already. Do I need to update to 3.0.57? Apache Foundation and NIST have revised their technical assessment of CVE-2021-44228 and advise that log4j v2.15.0 is not sufficient protection against exploitation. CPM 3.0.57 and later versions are the only CPM versions available with log4j 2.16.0.

      "body": "Summary New Relic has released Java agents 6.5.1 and 7.4.1 to address a critical vulnerability in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. A newer Java agent, 7.4.2, is also available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046, a lower severity issue in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 14, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement one of the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? To see agent version information, go to your Environment page in New Relic One. See our environment documentation for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x, and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already. Do I need to update to 7.4.2? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java Agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible.

      "body": "Summary New Relic released Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.57 on 2021-12-14 to address critical vulnerabilities CVE 2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 in the open source Apache Log4j framework. A malicious actor may be able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. New Relic also released Helm Charts version 1.0.45 on 2021-12-14 to address CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Helm Charts version 1.0.45 contains the CPM version 3.0.57. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-04 Priority: Critical Affected software Versions affected: All supported containerized private minion (CPM) versions prior to 3.0.57 Fixed version: 3.0.57, also available through Helm Charts version 1.0.45 New Relic CPM version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-45046 Severity: Critical CVSS 9.0 3.0.57 yes yes If you use Helm Charts to update your CPM configurations, you will want to implement New Relic Helm Charts version 1.0.45. This will update your CPM to version 3.0.57. Action items To remediate CVE-2021-44228 in the New Relic Containerized Private Minion, we recommend customers upgrade to version 3.0.57 as soon as possible. This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.16.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.45. Important If you have already upgraded to Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.55, Apache Foundation's current technical guidance is that your CPM has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We strongly recommend updating to CPM version 3.0.57 at this time. This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to NR21-03 for more information. Customers using log4j directly in their applications should carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities page for remediation details that should be considered. Vulnerability information A high level vulnerability was publicly disclosed for the log4j framework on 2021-12-09. An attacker is able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. CVE-2021-44228 CVSS 10.0 CVE-2021-45046 CVSS 9.0 Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions I've updated to CPM 3.0.55 already. Do I need to update to 3.0.57? Apache Foundation and NIST have revised their technical assessment of CVE-2021-44228 and advise that log4j v2.15.0 is not sufficient protection against exploitation. CPM 3.0.57 and later versions are the only CPM versions available with log4j 2.16.0.

      "body": "Summary New Relic has released Java agents 6.5.1 and 7.4.1 to address a critical vulnerability in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. A newer Java agent, 7.4.2, is also available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046, a lower severity issue in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 14, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement one of the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? To see agent version information, go to your Environment page in New Relic One. See our environment documentation for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x, and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already. Do I need to update to 7.4.2? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java Agent at this time.

      "body": "Summary New Relic released Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.57 on 2021-12-14 to address critical vulnerabilities CVE 2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 in the open source Apache Log4j framework. A malicious actor may be able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. New Relic also released Helm Charts version 1.0.45 on 2021-12-14 to address CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Helm Charts version 1.0.45 contains the CPM version 3.0.57. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-04 Priority: Critical Affected software Versions affected: All supported containerized private minion (CPM) versions prior to 3.0.57 Fixed version: 3.0.57, also available through Helm Charts version 1.0.45 New Relic CPM version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-45046 Severity: Critical CVSS 9.0 3.0.57 yes yes If you use Helm Charts to update your CPM configurations, you will want to implement New Relic Helm Charts version 1.0.45. This will update your CPM to version 3.0.57. Action items To remediate CVE-2021-44228 in the New Relic Containerized Private Minion, we recommend customers upgrade to version 3.0.57 as soon as possible. This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.16.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.45. Important If you have already upgraded to Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.55, Apache Foundation's current technical guidance is that your CPM has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We strongly recommend updating to CPM version 3.0.57 at this time. This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to NR21-03 for more information. Customers using log4j directly in their applications should carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities page for remediation details that should be considered. Vulnerability information A high level vulnerability was publicly disclosed for the log4j framework on 2021-12-09. An attacker is able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. CVE-2021-44228 CVSS 10.0 CVE-2021-45046 CVSS 9.0 Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions I've updated to CPM 3.0.55 already. Do I need to update to 3.0.57? Apache Foundation and NIST have revised their technical assessment of CVE-2021-44228 and advise that log4j v2.15.0 is not sufficient protection against exploitation. CPM 3.0.57 and later versions are the only CPM versions available with log4j 2.16.0.

      "body": "Summary New Relic has released Java agents 6.5.1 and 7.4.1 to address a critical vulnerability in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. A newer Java agent, 7.4.2, is also available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046, a lower severity issue in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 14, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement one of the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? To see agent version information, go to your Environment page in New Relic One. See our environment documentation for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x, and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already. Do I need to update to 7.4.2? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java Agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible.

This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.16.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.45. Important If you have already upgraded to Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.55, Apache Foundation's current technical guidance is that your CPM has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We strongly recommend updating to CPM version 3.0.57 at this time. This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to NR21-03 for more information. Customers using log4j directly in their applications should carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities page for remediation details that should be considered. Vulnerability information A high level vulnerability was publicly disclosed for the log4j framework on 2021-12-09. An attacker is able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters.

      "body": "Summary New Relic has released Java agents 6.5.1 and 7.4.1 to address a critical vulnerability in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. A newer Java agent, 7.4.2, is also available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046, a lower severity issue in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 14, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement one of the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? To see agent version information, go to your Environment page in New Relic One. See our environment documentation for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x, and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already. Do I need to update to 7.4.2? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java Agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. Publication history December 14, 2021: NR21-03 Major Revision: New fix version 7.4.2 available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Updated to include an additional workaround option. Updated to provide clarity between New Relic Java agent updates and the best practices customers should take to secure their applications. Added technical vulnerability descriptions and CVSS scores from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

      "body": "Summary New Relic has released Java agents 6.5.1 and 7.4.1 to address a critical vulnerability in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. A newer Java agent, 7.4.2, is also available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046, a lower severity issue in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 14, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement one of the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? To see agent version information, go to your Environment page in New Relic One. See our environment documentation for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x, and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already. Do I need to update to 7.4.2? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java Agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. Publication history December 14, 2021: NR21-03 Major Revision: New fix version 7.4.2 available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Updated to include an additional workaround option. Updated to provide clarity between New Relic Java agent updates and the best practices customers should take to secure their applications. Added technical vulnerability descriptions and CVSS scores from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). December 13, 2021: NR21-03 updated to include more explicit workaround guidance and FAQs December 10, 2021: NR21-03 published Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data.

This will update your CPM to version 3.0.57. Action items To remediate CVE-2021-44228 in the New Relic Containerized Private Minion, we recommend customers upgrade to version 3.0.57 as soon as possible. This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.16.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.45. Important If you have already upgraded to Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.55, Apache Foundation's current technical guidance is that your CPM has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We strongly recommend updating to CPM version 3.0.57 at this time. This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to NR21-03 for more information. Customers using log4j directly in their applications should carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities page for remediation details that should be considered. Vulnerability information A high level vulnerability was publicly disclosed for the log4j framework on 2021-12-09.

Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement one of the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? To see agent version information, go to your Environment page in New Relic One. See our environment documentation for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x, and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already. Do I need to update to 7.4.2? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java Agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible.

This will update your CPM to version 3.0.57. Action items To remediate CVE-2021-44228 in the New Relic Containerized Private Minion, we recommend customers upgrade to version 3.0.57 as soon as possible. This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.16.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.45. Important If you have already upgraded to Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.55, Apache Foundation's current technical guidance is that your CPM has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We strongly recommend updating to CPM version 3.0.57 at this time. This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to NR21-03 for more information. Customers using log4j directly in their applications should carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities page for remediation details that should be considered. Vulnerability information A high level vulnerability was publicly disclosed for the log4j framework on 2021-12-09.

      "body": "Summary New Relic has released Java agents 6.5.1 and 7.4.1 to address a critical vulnerability in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. A newer Java agent, 7.4.2, is also available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046, a lower severity issue in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 14, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement one of the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? To see agent version information, go to your Environment page in New Relic One. See our environment documentation for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x, and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already. Do I need to update to 7.4.2?

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data.

      "body": "Summary New Relic released Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.57 on 2021-12-14 to address critical vulnerabilities CVE 2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 in the open source Apache Log4j framework. A malicious actor may be able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. New Relic also released Helm Charts version 1.0.45 on 2021-12-14 to address CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Helm Charts version 1.0.45 contains the CPM version 3.0.57. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-04 Priority: Critical Affected software Versions affected: All supported containerized private minion (CPM) versions prior to 3.0.57 Fixed version: 3.0.57, also available through Helm Charts version 1.0.45 New Relic CPM version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-45046 Severity: Critical CVSS 9.0 3.0.57 yes yes If you use Helm Charts to update your CPM configurations, you will want to implement New Relic Helm Charts version 1.0.45. This will update your CPM to version 3.0.57. Action items To remediate CVE-2021-44228 in the New Relic Containerized Private Minion, we recommend customers upgrade to version 3.0.57 as soon as possible. This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.16.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.45. Important If you have already upgraded to Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.55, Apache Foundation's current technical guidance is that your CPM has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We strongly recommend updating to CPM version 3.0.57 at this time. This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to NR21-03 for more information. Customers using log4j directly in their applications should carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities page for remediation details that should be considered. Vulnerability information A high level vulnerability was publicly disclosed for the log4j framework on 2021-12-09. An attacker is able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. CVE-2021-44228 CVSS 10.0 CVE-2021-45046 CVSS 9.0 Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions I've updated to CPM 3.0.55 already. Do I need to update to 3.0.57? Apache Foundation and NIST have revised their technical assessment of CVE-2021-44228 and advise that log4j v2.15.0 is not sufficient protection against exploitation. CPM 3.0.57 and later versions are the only CPM versions available with log4j 2.16.0.

      "body": "Summary New Relic has released Java agents 6.5.1 and 7.4.1 to address a critical vulnerability in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. A newer Java agent, 7.4.2, is also available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046, a lower severity issue in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 14, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement one of the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? To see agent version information, go to your Environment page in New Relic One. See our environment documentation for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x, and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already. Do I need to update to 7.4.2? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java Agent at this time.

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "Summary New Relic released Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.57 on 2021-12-14 to address critical vulnerabilities CVE 2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 in the open source Apache Log4j framework. A malicious actor may be able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. New Relic also released Helm Charts version 1.0.45 on 2021-12-14 to address CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Helm Charts version 1.0.45 contains the CPM version 3.0.57. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-04 Priority: Critical Affected software Versions affected: All supported containerized private minion (CPM) versions prior to 3.0.57 Fixed version: 3.0.57, also available through Helm Charts version 1.0.45 New Relic CPM version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-45046 Severity: Critical CVSS 9.0 3.0.57 yes yes If you use Helm Charts to update your CPM configurations, you will want to implement New Relic Helm Charts version 1.0.45. This will update your CPM to version 3.0.57. Action items To remediate CVE-2021-44228 in the New Relic Containerized Private Minion, we recommend customers upgrade to version 3.0.57 as soon as possible. This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.16.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.45. Important If you have already upgraded to Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.55, Apache Foundation's current technical guidance is that your CPM has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We strongly recommend updating to CPM version 3.0.57 at this time. This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to NR21-03 for more information. Customers using log4j directly in their applications should carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities page for remediation details that should be considered. Vulnerability information A high level vulnerability was publicly disclosed for the log4j framework on 2021-12-09. An attacker is able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. CVE-2021-44228 CVSS 10.0 CVE-2021-45046 CVSS 9.0 Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions I've updated to CPM 3.0.55 already. Do I need to update to 3.0.57? Apache Foundation and NIST have revised their technical assessment of CVE-2021-44228 and advise that log4j v2.15.0 is not sufficient protection against exploitation. CPM 3.0.57 and later versions are the only CPM versions available with log4j 2.16.0.

      "body": "Summary New Relic has released Java agents 6.5.1 and 7.4.1 to address a critical vulnerability in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. A newer Java agent, 7.4.2, is also available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046, a lower severity issue in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 14, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement one of the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? To see agent version information, go to your Environment page in New Relic One. See our environment documentation for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x, and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already. Do I need to update to 7.4.2? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java Agent at this time.

      "body": "Summary New Relic released Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.57 on 2021-12-14 to address critical vulnerabilities CVE 2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 in the open source Apache Log4j framework. A malicious actor may be able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. New Relic also released Helm Charts version 1.0.45 on 2021-12-14 to address CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Helm Charts version 1.0.45 contains the CPM version 3.0.57. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-04 Priority: Critical Affected software Versions affected: All supported containerized private minion (CPM) versions prior to 3.0.57 Fixed version: 3.0.57, also available through Helm Charts version 1.0.45 New Relic CPM version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-45046 Severity: Critical CVSS 9.0 3.0.57 yes yes If you use Helm Charts to update your CPM configurations, you will want to implement New Relic Helm Charts version 1.0.45. This will update your CPM to version 3.0.57. Action items To remediate CVE-2021-44228 in the New Relic Containerized Private Minion, we recommend customers upgrade to version 3.0.57 as soon as possible. This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.16.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.45. Important If you have already upgraded to Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.55, Apache Foundation's current technical guidance is that your CPM has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We strongly recommend updating to CPM version 3.0.57 at this time. This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to NR21-03 for more information. Customers using log4j directly in their applications should carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities page for remediation details that should be considered. Vulnerability information A high level vulnerability was publicly disclosed for the log4j framework on 2021-12-09. An attacker is able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. CVE-2021-44228 CVSS 10.0 CVE-2021-45046 CVSS 9.0 Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions I've updated to CPM 3.0.55 already. Do I need to update to 3.0.57? Apache Foundation and NIST have revised their technical assessment of CVE-2021-44228 and advise that log4j v2.15.0 is not sufficient protection against exploitation. CPM 3.0.57 and later versions are the only CPM versions available with log4j 2.16.0.

      "body": "Summary New Relic has released Java agents 6.5.1 and 7.4.1 to address a critical vulnerability in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. A newer Java agent, 7.4.2, is also available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046, a lower severity issue in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 14, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement one of the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? To see agent version information, go to your Environment page in New Relic One. See our environment documentation for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x, and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already. Do I need to update to 7.4.2? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java Agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible.

      "body": "Summary New Relic has released Java agents 6.5.1 and 7.4.1 to address a critical vulnerability in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. A newer Java agent, 7.4.2, is also available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046, a lower severity issue in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 14, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement one of the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? To see agent version information, go to your Environment page in New Relic One. See our environment documentation for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x, and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already. Do I need to update to 7.4.2? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java Agent at this time.

      "body": "Summary New Relic has released Java agents 6.5.1 and 7.4.1 to address a critical vulnerability in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. A newer Java agent, 7.4.2, is also available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046, a lower severity issue in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 14, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement one of the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? To see agent version information, go to your Environment page in New Relic One. See our environment documentation for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x, and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already. Do I need to update to 7.4.2? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java Agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. Publication history December 14, 2021: NR21-03 Major Revision: New fix version 7.4.2 available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Updated to include an additional workaround option. Updated to provide clarity between New Relic Java agent updates and the best practices customers should take to secure their applications. Added technical vulnerability descriptions and CVSS scores from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

      "body": "Summary New Relic released Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.57 on 2021-12-14 to address critical vulnerabilities CVE 2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 in the open source Apache Log4j framework. A malicious actor may be able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. New Relic also released Helm Charts version 1.0.45 on 2021-12-14 to address CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Helm Charts version 1.0.45 contains the CPM version 3.0.57. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-04 Priority: Critical Affected software Versions affected: All supported containerized private minion (CPM) versions prior to 3.0.57 Fixed version: 3.0.57, also available through Helm Charts version 1.0.45 New Relic CPM version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-45046 Severity: Critical CVSS 9.0 3.0.57 yes yes If you use Helm Charts to update your CPM configurations, you will want to implement New Relic Helm Charts version 1.0.45. This will update your CPM to version 3.0.57. Action items To remediate CVE-2021-44228 in the New Relic Containerized Private Minion, we recommend customers upgrade to version 3.0.57 as soon as possible. This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.16.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.45. Important If you have already upgraded to Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.55, Apache Foundation's current technical guidance is that your CPM has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We strongly recommend updating to CPM version 3.0.57 at this time. This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to NR21-03 for more information. Customers using log4j directly in their applications should carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities page for remediation details that should be considered. Vulnerability information A high level vulnerability was publicly disclosed for the log4j framework on 2021-12-09. An attacker is able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. CVE-2021-44228 CVSS 10.0 CVE-2021-45046 CVSS 9.0 Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions I've updated to CPM 3.0.55 already. Do I need to update to 3.0.57? Apache Foundation and NIST have revised their technical assessment of CVE-2021-44228 and advise that log4j v2.15.0 is not sufficient protection against exploitation.

      "body": "Summary New Relic has released Java agents 6.5.1 and 7.4.1 to address a critical vulnerability in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. A newer Java agent, 7.4.2, is also available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046, a lower severity issue in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 14, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement one of the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? To see agent version information, go to your Environment page in New Relic One. See our environment documentation for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x, and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already. Do I need to update to 7.4.2? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java Agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. Publication history December 14, 2021: NR21-03 Major Revision: New fix version 7.4.2 available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Updated to include an additional workaround option. Updated to provide clarity between New Relic Java agent updates and the best practices customers should take to secure their applications. Added technical vulnerability descriptions and CVSS scores from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

This will update your CPM to version 3.0.57. Action items To remediate CVE-2021-44228 in the New Relic Containerized Private Minion, we recommend customers upgrade to version 3.0.57 as soon as possible. This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.16.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.45. Important If you have already upgraded to Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.55, Apache Foundation's current technical guidance is that your CPM has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We strongly recommend updating to CPM version 3.0.57 at this time. This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to NR21-03 for more information. Customers using log4j directly in their applications should carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities page for remediation details that should be considered.

A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement one of the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? To see agent version information, go to your Environment page in New Relic One. See our environment documentation for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x, and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already. Do I need to update to 7.4.2? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java Agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. Publication history December 14, 2021: NR21-03 Major Revision: New fix version 7.4.2 available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Updated to include an additional workaround option. Updated to provide clarity between New Relic Java agent updates and the best practices customers should take to secure their applications.

A malicious actor may be able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. New Relic also released Helm Charts version 1.0.45 on 2021-12-14 to address CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Helm Charts version 1.0.45 contains the CPM version 3.0.57. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-04 Priority: Critical Affected software Versions affected: All supported containerized private minion (CPM) versions prior to 3.0.57 Fixed version: 3.0.57, also available through Helm Charts version 1.0.45 New Relic CPM version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-45046 Severity: Critical CVSS 9.0 3.0.57 yes yes If you use Helm Charts to update your CPM configurations, you will want to implement New Relic Helm Charts version 1.0.45. This will update your CPM to version 3.0.57. Action items To remediate CVE-2021-44228 in the New Relic Containerized Private Minion, we recommend customers upgrade to version 3.0.57 as soon as possible. This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.16.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.45. Important If you have already upgraded to Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.55, Apache Foundation's current technical guidance is that your CPM has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We strongly recommend updating to CPM version 3.0.57 at this time. This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to NR21-03 for more information. Customers using log4j directly in their applications should carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities page for remediation details that should be considered. Vulnerability information A high level vulnerability was publicly disclosed for the log4j framework on 2021-12-09. An attacker is able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters.

      "body": "Summary New Relic has released Java agents 6.5.1 and 7.4.1 to address a critical vulnerability in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. A newer Java agent, 7.4.2, is also available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046, a lower severity issue in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 14, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information.

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "Summary New Relic released Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.57 on 2021-12-14 to address critical vulnerabilities CVE 2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 in the open source Apache Log4j framework. A malicious actor may be able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. New Relic also released Helm Charts version 1.0.45 on 2021-12-14 to address CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Helm Charts version 1.0.45 contains the CPM version 3.0.57. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-04 Priority: Critical Affected software Versions affected: All supported containerized private minion (CPM) versions prior to 3.0.57 Fixed version: 3.0.57, also available through Helm Charts version 1.0.45 New Relic CPM version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-45046 Severity: Critical CVSS 9.0 3.0.57 yes yes If you use Helm Charts to update your CPM configurations, you will want to implement New Relic Helm Charts version 1.0.45. This will update your CPM to version 3.0.57. Action items To remediate CVE-2021-44228 in the New Relic Containerized Private Minion, we recommend customers upgrade to version 3.0.57 as soon as possible. This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.16.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.45. Important If you have already upgraded to Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.55, Apache Foundation's current technical guidance is that your CPM has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We strongly recommend updating to CPM version 3.0.57 at this time. This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to NR21-03 for more information. Customers using log4j directly in their applications should carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities page for remediation details that should be considered. Vulnerability information A high level vulnerability was publicly disclosed for the log4j framework on 2021-12-09. An attacker is able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. CVE-2021-44228 CVSS 10.0 CVE-2021-45046 CVSS 9.0 Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions I've updated to CPM 3.0.55 already. Do I need to update to 3.0.57? Apache Foundation and NIST have revised their technical assessment of CVE-2021-44228 and advise that log4j v2.15.0 is not sufficient protection against exploitation. CPM 3.0.57 and later versions are the only CPM versions available with log4j 2.16.0.

      "body": "Summary New Relic has released Java agents 6.5.1 and 7.4.1 to address a critical vulnerability in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. A newer Java agent, 7.4.2, is also available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046, a lower severity issue in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 14, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement one of the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? To see agent version information, go to your Environment page in New Relic One. See our environment documentation for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x, and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already. Do I need to update to 7.4.2? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java Agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. Publication history December 14, 2021: NR21-03 Major Revision: New fix version 7.4.2 available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Updated to include an additional workaround option. Updated to provide clarity between New Relic Java agent updates and the best practices customers should take to secure their applications.

      "body": "Summary New Relic released Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.57 on 2021-12-14 to address critical vulnerabilities CVE 2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 in the open source Apache Log4j framework. A malicious actor may be able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. New Relic also released Helm Charts version 1.0.45 on 2021-12-14 to address CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Helm Charts version 1.0.45 contains the CPM version 3.0.57. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-04 Priority: Critical Affected software Versions affected: All supported containerized private minion (CPM) versions prior to 3.0.57 Fixed version: 3.0.57, also available through Helm Charts version 1.0.45 New Relic CPM version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-45046 Severity: Critical CVSS 9.0 3.0.57 yes yes If you use Helm Charts to update your CPM configurations, you will want to implement New Relic Helm Charts version 1.0.45. This will update your CPM to version 3.0.57. Action items To remediate CVE-2021-44228 in the New Relic Containerized Private Minion, we recommend customers upgrade to version 3.0.57 as soon as possible. This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.16.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.45. Important If you have already upgraded to Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.55, Apache Foundation's current technical guidance is that your CPM has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We strongly recommend updating to CPM version 3.0.57 at this time. This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to NR21-03 for more information. Customers using log4j directly in their applications should carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities page for remediation details that should be considered. Vulnerability information A high level vulnerability was publicly disclosed for the log4j framework on 2021-12-09. An attacker is able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. CVE-2021-44228 CVSS 10.0 CVE-2021-45046 CVSS 9.0 Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions I've updated to CPM 3.0.55 already. Do I need to update to 3.0.57? Apache Foundation and NIST have revised their technical assessment of CVE-2021-44228 and advise that log4j v2.15.0 is not sufficient protection against exploitation. CPM 3.0.57 and later versions are the only CPM versions available with log4j 2.16.0.

      "body": "Summary New Relic has released Java agents 6.5.1 and 7.4.1 to address a critical vulnerability in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. A newer Java agent, 7.4.2, is also available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046, a lower severity issue in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 14, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement one of the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? To see agent version information, go to your Environment page in New Relic One. See our environment documentation for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x, and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already. Do I need to update to 7.4.2? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java Agent at this time.

      "body": "Summary New Relic released Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.57 on 2021-12-14 to address critical vulnerabilities CVE 2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 in the open source Apache Log4j framework. A malicious actor may be able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. New Relic also released Helm Charts version 1.0.45 on 2021-12-14 to address CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Helm Charts version 1.0.45 contains the CPM version 3.0.57. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-04 Priority: Critical Affected software Versions affected: All supported containerized private minion (CPM) versions prior to 3.0.57 Fixed version: 3.0.57, also available through Helm Charts version 1.0.45 New Relic CPM version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-45046 Severity: Critical CVSS 9.0 3.0.57 yes yes If you use Helm Charts to update your CPM configurations, you will want to implement New Relic Helm Charts version 1.0.45. This will update your CPM to version 3.0.57. Action items To remediate CVE-2021-44228 in the New Relic Containerized Private Minion, we recommend customers upgrade to version 3.0.57 as soon as possible. This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.16.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.45. Important If you have already upgraded to Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.55, Apache Foundation's current technical guidance is that your CPM has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We strongly recommend updating to CPM version 3.0.57 at this time. This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to NR21-03 for more information. Customers using log4j directly in their applications should carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities page for remediation details that should be considered. Vulnerability information A high level vulnerability was publicly disclosed for the log4j framework on 2021-12-09. An attacker is able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. CVE-2021-44228 CVSS 10.0 CVE-2021-45046 CVSS 9.0 Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions I've updated to CPM 3.0.55 already. Do I need to update to 3.0.57? Apache Foundation and NIST have revised their technical assessment of CVE-2021-44228 and advise that log4j v2.15.0 is not sufficient protection against exploitation. CPM 3.0.57 and later versions are the only CPM versions available with log4j 2.16.0.

      "body": "Summary New Relic has released Java agents 6.5.1 and 7.4.1 to address a critical vulnerability in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. A newer Java agent, 7.4.2, is also available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046, a lower severity issue in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 14, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement one of the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? To see agent version information, go to your Environment page in New Relic One. See our environment documentation for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x, and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already. Do I need to update to 7.4.2? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java Agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible.

This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.16.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.45. Important If you have already upgraded to Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.55, Apache Foundation's current technical guidance is that your CPM has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We strongly recommend updating to CPM version 3.0.57 at this time. This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to NR21-03 for more information. Customers using log4j directly in their applications should carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities page for remediation details that should be considered. Vulnerability information A high level vulnerability was publicly disclosed for the log4j framework on 2021-12-09. An attacker is able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters.

      "body": "Summary New Relic has released Java agents 6.5.1 and 7.4.1 to address a critical vulnerability in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. A newer Java agent, 7.4.2, is also available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046, a lower severity issue in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 14, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement one of the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? To see agent version information, go to your Environment page in New Relic One. See our environment documentation for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x, and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already. Do I need to update to 7.4.2? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java Agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. Publication history December 14, 2021: NR21-03 Major Revision: New fix version 7.4.2 available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Updated to include an additional workaround option. Updated to provide clarity between New Relic Java agent updates and the best practices customers should take to secure their applications. Added technical vulnerability descriptions and CVSS scores from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "Summary New Relic has released Java agents 6.5.1 and 7.4.1 to address a critical vulnerability in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. A newer Java agent, 7.4.2, is also available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046, a lower severity issue in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 14, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement one of the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? To see agent version information, go to your Environment page in New Relic One. See our environment documentation for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x, and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already. Do I need to update to 7.4.2? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java Agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. Publication history December 14, 2021: NR21-03 Major Revision: New fix version 7.4.2 available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Updated to include an additional workaround option. Updated to provide clarity between New Relic Java agent updates and the best practices customers should take to secure their applications. Added technical vulnerability descriptions and CVSS scores from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). December 13, 2021: NR21-03 updated to include more explicit workaround guidance and FAQs December 10, 2021: NR21-03 published Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data.

      "body": "Summary New Relic released Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.57 on 2021-12-14 to address critical vulnerabilities CVE 2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 in the open source Apache Log4j framework. A malicious actor may be able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. New Relic also released Helm Charts version 1.0.45 on 2021-12-14 to address CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Helm Charts version 1.0.45 contains the CPM version 3.0.57. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-04 Priority: Critical Affected software Versions affected: All supported containerized private minion (CPM) versions prior to 3.0.57 Fixed version: 3.0.57, also available through Helm Charts version 1.0.45 New Relic CPM version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-45046 Severity: Critical CVSS 9.0 3.0.57 yes yes If you use Helm Charts to update your CPM configurations, you will want to implement New Relic Helm Charts version 1.0.45. This will update your CPM to version 3.0.57. Action items To remediate CVE-2021-44228 in the New Relic Containerized Private Minion, we recommend customers upgrade to version 3.0.57 as soon as possible. This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.16.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.45. Important If you have already upgraded to Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.55, Apache Foundation's current technical guidance is that your CPM has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We strongly recommend updating to CPM version 3.0.57 at this time. This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to NR21-03 for more information. Customers using log4j directly in their applications should carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities page for remediation details that should be considered. Vulnerability information A high level vulnerability was publicly disclosed for the log4j framework on 2021-12-09. An attacker is able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. CVE-2021-44228 CVSS 10.0 CVE-2021-45046 CVSS 9.0 Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions I've updated to CPM 3.0.55 already. Do I need to update to 3.0.57? Apache Foundation and NIST have revised their technical assessment of CVE-2021-44228 and advise that log4j v2.15.0 is not sufficient protection against exploitation. CPM 3.0.57 and later versions are the only CPM versions available with log4j 2.16.0.

      "body": "Summary New Relic has released Java agents 6.5.1 and 7.4.1 to address a critical vulnerability in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. A newer Java agent, 7.4.2, is also available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046, a lower severity issue in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 14, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement one of the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? To see agent version information, go to your Environment page in New Relic One. See our environment documentation for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x, and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already. Do I need to update to 7.4.2? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java Agent at this time.

      "body": "Summary New Relic released Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.57 on 2021-12-14 to address critical vulnerabilities CVE 2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 in the open source Apache Log4j framework. A malicious actor may be able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. New Relic also released Helm Charts version 1.0.45 on 2021-12-14 to address CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Helm Charts version 1.0.45 contains the CPM version 3.0.57. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-04 Priority: Critical Affected software Versions affected: All supported containerized private minion (CPM) versions prior to 3.0.57 Fixed version: 3.0.57, also available through Helm Charts version 1.0.45 New Relic CPM version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-45046 Severity: Critical CVSS 9.0 3.0.57 yes yes If you use Helm Charts to update your CPM configurations, you will want to implement New Relic Helm Charts version 1.0.45. This will update your CPM to version 3.0.57. Action items To remediate CVE-2021-44228 in the New Relic Containerized Private Minion, we recommend customers upgrade to version 3.0.57 as soon as possible. This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.16.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.45. Important If you have already upgraded to Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.55, Apache Foundation's current technical guidance is that your CPM has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We strongly recommend updating to CPM version 3.0.57 at this time. This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to NR21-03 for more information. Customers using log4j directly in their applications should carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities page for remediation details that should be considered. Vulnerability information A high level vulnerability was publicly disclosed for the log4j framework on 2021-12-09. An attacker is able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. CVE-2021-44228 CVSS 10.0 CVE-2021-45046 CVSS 9.0 Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions I've updated to CPM 3.0.55 already. Do I need to update to 3.0.57? Apache Foundation and NIST have revised their technical assessment of CVE-2021-44228 and advise that log4j v2.15.0 is not sufficient protection against exploitation. CPM 3.0.57 and later versions are the only CPM versions available with log4j 2.16.0.

      "body": "Summary New Relic has released Java agents 6.5.1 and 7.4.1 to address a critical vulnerability in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 9, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. A newer Java agent, 7.4.2, is also available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046, a lower severity issue in the open source log4j framework that was publicly disclosed on December 14, 2021. A malicious actor may be able to trigger a denial of service condition in certain non-default configurations. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-03 Versions affected Versions affected: All agent versions between 4.12.0 to 6.5.0 or 7.4.0 CVE-2021-44228: Fixed in 6.5.1, 7.4.1, 7.4.2 CVE-2021-45046: Fixed in 7.4.2 New Relic Java agent version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-44046 Severity: Low CVSS 3.7 6.5.1 yes no 7.4.1 yes no 7.4.2 yes yes Action items To remediate CVE 2021-44228 in the New Relic Java agent, we recommend customers upgrade to agent release 7.4.2 as soon as possible (requires Java 8 or higher). If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability - CVE-2021-44228. Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. If you are on an earlier version of the agent, are using Java 7, or cannot upgrade your agent version, we recommend you either disable the Java agent logging, or use the Apache workaround options. Option 1. Disable the Java agent logging You can set your Java agent logging level to OFF to temporarily remediate CVE-2021-44228. To do this, use any of the following options: Modify your local agent configuration file (search for the log_level parameter). Define the newrelic.config.log_level=OFF system property. Set the NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=OFF environment variable. Then restart your application. After restart, you can verify that agent logging has been disabled by checking the agent log file. You should not see any new messages being written. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. Option 2. Apache workaround options Apache has published multiple workaround optionsfor CVE-2021-44228, one of which we recommend for the New Relic Java agent. You should define the log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true system property as part of your application startup, then restart your application. Note: This workaround is recommended only as a temporary solution until you can update your agent version. If you use log4j directly in your applications, be sure to carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities. This page provides remediation details for you to consider. Containerized private minions You may also need to update your New Relic Containerized Private Minions. Please refer to NR21-04 for more information. Technical vulnerability information Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions What are our options if we are not able to upgrade our Java agent or version of Java? Please implement one of the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. How do I find out which versions of the agent we are running? To see agent version information, go to your Environment page in New Relic One. See our environment documentation for more information. Why isn't there a patch for agent v5 and below? Most of our customers are using agent versions 6.x or 7.x, and we encourage customers to use newer versions of our agent to ensure they have the best experience. If you are not able to upgrade your agent version, please implement the recommended workarounds in this bulletin. I've updated to 6.5.1 or 7.4.1 already. Do I need to update to 7.4.2? If you have already upgraded to agent versions 6.5.1 or 7.4.1, your agent is remediated against the most severe vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228). Due to the special non-default conditions required for exploitation of this issue not being present in the New Relic Java agent, we do not believe CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited in the New Relic Java Agent at this time. We offer the 7.4.2 update to customers out of an abundance of caution, and to support those customers that wish to ensure they have the most current versions possible. Publication history December 14, 2021: NR21-03 Major Revision: New fix version 7.4.2 available to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Updated to include an additional workaround option. Updated to provide clarity between New Relic Java agent updates and the best practices customers should take to secure their applications. Added technical vulnerability descriptions and CVSS scores from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

A malicious actor may be able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. New Relic also released Helm Charts version 1.0.45 on 2021-12-14 to address CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Helm Charts version 1.0.45 contains the CPM version 3.0.57. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-04 Priority: Critical Affected software Versions affected: All supported containerized private minion (CPM) versions prior to 3.0.57 Fixed version: 3.0.57, also available through Helm Charts version 1.0.45 New Relic CPM version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-45046 Severity: Critical CVSS 9.0 3.0.57 yes yes If you use Helm Charts to update your CPM configurations, you will want to implement New Relic Helm Charts version 1.0.45. This will update your CPM to version 3.0.57. Action items To remediate CVE-2021-44228 in the New Relic Containerized Private Minion, we recommend customers upgrade to version 3.0.57 as soon as possible. This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.16.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.45. Important If you have already upgraded to Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.55, Apache Foundation's current technical guidance is that your CPM has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We strongly recommend updating to CPM version 3.0.57 at this time. This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to NR21-03 for more information. Customers using log4j directly in their applications should carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities page for remediation details that should be considered. Vulnerability information A high level vulnerability was publicly disclosed for the log4j framework on 2021-12-09.

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact.

      "body": "Summary New Relic released Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.57 on 2021-12-14 to address critical vulnerabilities CVE 2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 in the open source Apache Log4j framework. A malicious actor may be able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. New Relic also released Helm Charts version 1.0.45 on 2021-12-14 to address CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Helm Charts version 1.0.45 contains the CPM version 3.0.57. New Relic will update this Security Bulletin and our customer guidance as new information becomes available. Vulnerability identifier: NR21-04 Priority: Critical Affected software Versions affected: All supported containerized private minion (CPM) versions prior to 3.0.57 Fixed version: 3.0.57, also available through Helm Charts version 1.0.45 New Relic CPM version Remediates CVE-2021-44228 Severity: Critical CVSS 10.0 Remediates CVE-2021-45046 Severity: Critical CVSS 9.0 3.0.57 yes yes If you use Helm Charts to update your CPM configurations, you will want to implement New Relic Helm Charts version 1.0.45. This will update your CPM to version 3.0.57. Action items To remediate CVE-2021-44228 in the New Relic Containerized Private Minion, we recommend customers upgrade to version 3.0.57 as soon as possible. This version has been updated to use the remediated 2.16.0 version of the Apache Log4j framework. You may update your CPM through Helm Charts version 1.0.45. Important If you have already upgraded to Containerized Private Minion (CPM) version 3.0.55, Apache Foundation's current technical guidance is that your CPM has incomplete protection against CVE 2021-44228 and remains susceptible to remote code execution. We strongly recommend updating to CPM version 3.0.57 at this time. This step will remediate your New Relic Containerized Private Minion (CPM) only. You may also need to update your New Relic Java agent. Please refer to NR21-03 for more information. Customers using log4j directly in their applications should carefully review the Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities page for remediation details that should be considered. Vulnerability information A high level vulnerability was publicly disclosed for the log4j framework on 2021-12-09. An attacker is able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. CVE-2021-44228 CVSS 10.0 CVE-2021-45046 CVSS 9.0 Apache log4j Security Vulnerabilities New Relic Explorers Hub Frequently asked questions I've updated to CPM 3.0.55 already. Do I need to update to 3.0.57? Apache Foundation and NIST have revised their technical assessment of CVE-2021-44228 and advise that log4j v2.15.0 is not sufficient protection against exploitation. CPM 3.0.57 and later versions are the only CPM versions available with log4j 2.16.0. Publication history December 17, 2021: NR21-04 Revision: Change in severity and technical description of CVE-2021-45046 December 16, 2021: NR21-04 Major Revision: Change in guidance regarding sufficiency of CPM 3.0.55 containing log4j version 2.15.0 to protect against exploitation of CVE-2021-44228. Addition of Helm Charts version 1.0.45 that contains the CPM 3.0.57 update. Update of NIST technical description of CVE-2021-44228. December 14, 2021: NR21-04 Major Revision: New fix version 3.0.57 released to address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Updated to provide better clarity between New Relic CPM updates and the best practices customers should take to secure their applications. Added FAQ section.

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

High Security vulnerability ratings At New Relic, we use four levels to rate security vulnerability. Rating Description Critical A vulnerability in a New Relic product or service that could be exploited to compromise the confidentiality or integrity of your data. High Atypical or unintended information is likely to be received by New Relic, potentially compromising the confidentiality or integrity of your data. Medium Atypical or unintended information could be received by New Relic, but the risk of compromise is mitigated by default configuration or standard security practices. Low Atypical or unintended information may be received by New Relic, but the vulnerability would be difficult to exploit, or it would have minimal impact. Report security vulnerabilities to New Relic New Relic is committed to the security of our customers and your data. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in one of our products, services, or websites, we welcome and greatly appreciate you reporting it to our coordinated disclosure program.

      "body": "Here's how you build a \"Hello, world!\" application in New Relic One. In this guide, you: Create a local version of the New Relic One site where you prototype your application Share your application with your teammates by publishing it to Instant Observability Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account. You need publish and subscribe permissions to complete this guide. Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Now, you have a Nerdpack, called my-awesome-nerdpack. This Nerdpack has a Nerdlet and a launcher that you named (though, this guide uses the default launcher name, \"launcher\", and Nerdlet name, \"home\"). You use this Nerdpack throughout this guide. Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip If you use VSCode, we have an extension and an extension pack you can use to build your app. Update and serve your application locally With nr1, you can serve a local build of your Nerdpack to New Relic One. This helps you develop your application in a production-like environment before you publish it. Before you change any code, familiarize yourself with the Nerdpack's directory structure: my-awesome-nerdpack/ ├───README.md ├───launchers/ │ └───launcher/ │ └───nr1.json ├───nerdlets/ │ └───home │ ├───index.js │ ├───nr1.json │ └───styles.scss ├───node_modules/ ├───nr1.json ├───package-lock.json └───package.json Copy The launchers and nerdlets directories contain the logic of your application. It's in these directories that you update most of your code. The nr1.json files throughout the Nerdpack hold metadata about your Nerdpack, Nerdlets, and launchers. Tip Read our documentation to learn more about the Nerdpack file structure. Step 1 of 6 In my-awesome-nerdpack/nerdlets/home/index.js, change the default return message to \"Hello, world!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class HomeNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>; } } Copy Step 2 of 6 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image named icon.png. In launchers/launcher, add an image called icon.png: my-awesome-nerdpack/ ├───README.md ├───launchers/ │ └───launcher/ │ ├───icon.png │ └───nr1.json ├───nerdlets/ │ └───home │ ├───index.js │ ├───nr1.json │ └───styles.scss ├───node_modules/ ├───nr1.json ├───package-lock.json └───package.json Copy This creates an icon for your launcher. In the root directory, add the same image: my-awesome-nerdpack/ ├───README.md ├───icon.png ├───launchers/ │ └───launcher/ │ ├───icon.png │ └───nr1.json ├───nerdlets/ │ └───home │ ├───index.js │ ├───nr1.json │ └───styles.scss ├───node_modules/ ├───nr1.json ├───package-lock.json └───package.json Copy This sets the icon for the app details page. Step 3 of 6 Next, change the name of the launcher to something more meaningful. In my-awesome-nerdpack/launchers/launcher/nr1.json, change the displayName to \"Hello world\": { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Hello world\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 4 of 6 To see your new changes locally, start a local Node server from within the Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Found and loaded 2 nr1.json files on MyAwesomeNerdpack (123a4b95-678c-9012-3456-d7e8f90g1hi2) Nerdpack. Nerdpack: ✔ MyAwesomeNerdpack (123a4b95-678c-9012-3456-d7e8f90g1hi2) nr1.json Launchers: ✔ launcher launchers/launcher/nr1.json Nerdlets: ✔ home nerdlets/home/nr1.json There is no certificate created yet. ✔ New certificate created. Webpack bundle analyzer is enabled (you need to wait for the first build to finish) └ You can head to http://127.0.0.1:27888 NOTE: To verify how your assets will look in production, you need to add \"--mode=prod\" when starting the development server. 🛠 Built artifact files for:ex.js... ⁎ 123a4b95-678c-9012-3456-d7e8f90g1hi2--home built ✔ ✔ Nerdpack built successfully! ★ Starting as orchestrator... ✔ Server ready! Test it at: https://one.newrelic.com/?nerdpacks=local ↩ Server will reload automatically if you modify any file! ℹ Additionally, you can test the following artifacts at: Launchers: ⁎ launcher https://onenr.io/0JBQrggmDwZ ℹ You can use \"npm start -- --mode=prod\" to run the development server in prod mode. Step 5 of 6 Use the url at the bottom of the output to open your launcher: bash Copy Launchers: ⁎ launcher https://onenr.io/0JBQrggmDwZ ℹ You can use \"npm start -- --mode=prod\" to run the development server in prod mode. Step 6 of 6 Here, you see your Nerdlet with your \"Hello, world!\" message: Publish your application Because you're serving your Nerdpack locally, your colleagues can't see it. When you're ready, publish it to Instant Observability, our unified catalog of integrations, dashboards, alerts, Nerdpacks, and more. Read our documentation to learn about Nerdpack permissions if you have trouble publishing your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 3 From its root directory, publish your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Found and loaded 2 nr1.json files on MyAwesomeNerdpack (123a4b95-678c-9012-3456-d7e8f90g1hi2) Nerdpack. Nerdpack: ✔ MyAwesomeNerdpack (123a4b95-678c-9012-3456-d7e8f90g1hi2) nr1.json Launchers: ✔ launcher launchers/launcher/nr1.json Nerdlets: ✔ home nerdlets/home/nr1.json 🛠 Built artifact files for: ⁎ 123a4b95-678c-9012-3456-d7e8f90g1hi2--home built ✔ ✔ Nerdpack built successfully!

Step 2 of 3 In New Relic, click Instant Observability: Step 3 of 3 Find and click your new Nerdpack: When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Describe your project with catalog details Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add information to help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 4 In your Nerdpack's root directory, execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type catalog ✔ created: launchers/launcher/catalog ✔ created: nerdlets/home/catalog ✔ catalog created successfully! catalog is available at \"./catalog\" This creates three directories: launchers/launcher/catalog: This holds launcher screenshots nerdlets/home/catalog: This holds Nerdlet screenshots catalog: This holds documentation, screenshots, a description, and more information about your Nerdpack Tip If you had other launchers, Nerdlets, or custom visualizations, they would also get catalog directories from this command. Here's how the results look in your project: my-awesome-nerdpack/ ├───README.md ├───icon.png ├───catalog/ │ ├───README.md │ ├───additionalInfo.md │ ├───config.json │ ├───documentation.md │ └───screenshots/ ├───launchers/ │ └───launcher/ │ ├───icon.png │ ├───catalog/ │ │ └───screenshots/ │ └───nr1.json ├───nerdlets/ │ └───home │ ├───index.js │ ├───nr1.json │ ├───catalog/ │ │ └───screenshots/ │ └───styles.scss ├───node_modules/ ├───nr1.json ├───package-lock.json └───package.json Copy Step 2 of 4 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. You can also add screenshots in the catalog directories of your launcher or Nerdlet. For details about what you can add, see Update your Nerdpack's catalog metadata. Step 3 of 4 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 4 of 4 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. And if you added screenshots to your launcher or Nerdlet, you can see them under What's inside: Subscribe accounts to your application You need to subscribe to your application to use it. To learn about what users on your account have the ability to subscribe, read our permissions documentation. Step 1 of 5 If you're not already there, navigate to your application in Instant Observability: Step 2 of 5 On your application's description page, click Add this app: Step 3 of 5 Select the accounts that you want to subscribe to the application, then update your accounts: Step 4 of 5 Go to the Apps page: Here, you find the apps your accounts are susbscribed to. Step 5 of 5 Click your launcher: Here, you see your application: Summary Now that you've completed the steps in this example, you learned the basic steps to: Create a local application Publish the application to Instant Observability so you can share it with your colleagues Add details to the project in the catalog so users understand how to use it Subscribe accounts to your application so other users can use it",

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All CloudWatch metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay, and therefore not included in the stream. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Cost considerations Consider the following when evaluating the cost of the AWS CloudWatch metric streams integration with New Relic: AWS CloudWatch metric updates. See Metric Streams. AWS Kinesis Firehose ingest. AWS Kinesis Firehose data transfer. Optionally, custom tags and CloudWatch metrics enrichment with resource metadata is based on the AWS Config service. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. This template is provided as a base to setup the integration on a single region, and can be customized and extended based on your requirements. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: New Relic Ensure the following settings are defined: New Relic configuration (Destination Settings) HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Tip AWS CloudWatch metrics for global services such as AWS S3 or AWS Billing are only availble in the us-east-1 region. Make sure there's an active CloudWatch metric stream configured in that region. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum(aws.s3.5xxErrors) FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from most services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Note that not all metrics have their custom tags as dimensions. Currently, only metrics linked to entities in the New Relic Explorer have their custom tags associated. The AWS CloudWatch metric stream doesn't include tags as part of the stream message, hence, additional processing is required on the New Relic side. Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for the most popular AWS Services are available in New Relic Instant Observaiblity. How to import dashboards Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Click Instant Observability from the top bar in New Relic One. Search for any AWS service name, such as AWS SQS, AWS RDS, AWS ELB, or AWS EC2. Access the AWS service tile. Click Install this quickstarts and select your account. Click Done to confirm that AWS metric stream is already configured. Browse and adapt the dashboard according to your needs. Have an interesting dashboard to share with the community? See contribution guidelines in the Instant Observability Github repository. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in the CloudWatch Metric Stream in order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from AWS API polling integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Migration steps On a typical deployment, migrating from API polling to metric stream involves the following steps (we recommend trying this on a dev / staging environment first): Go through the AWS UI in New Relic (or use NerdGraph APIs) to link your AWS account with New Relic. This is currently needed even if your AWS account is already linked with polling integrations. Make sure you complete the last step in the onboarding, which involves enabling AWS CloudWatch metric stream and the AWS Kinesis Data Firehose to push metrics to New Relic. Complete this step for any additional AWS region you want to monitor, since AWS CloudWatch requires one stream per region. Ensure metrics are received from all connected regions and namespaces. This may take several minutes. Disable all unnecessary polling integrations in the previous AWS provider account. The following integrations still need to be enabled since they aren't fully replaced by metric streams: AWS Billing, AWS CloudTrail, AWS Health, AWS Trusted Advisor. Query, dashboard, alert and inventory considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Dashboards: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events will still work as expected. Alerts: Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events will still work. We recommend adapting those to the dimensional metric format (using NRQL as source). Entities: New Relic Explorer might show duplicated entities for up to 24 hours. Inventory: the Inventory page is not supported with AWS CloudWatch metric streams (inventory telemetry is not included in the stream). Integrations not fully replaced by metric streams The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects CloudWatch metrics, resource metadata and custom tags. The following API polling integrations still need to be enabled to get complete visibility from AWS: AWS Billing AWS CloudTrail AWS Health AWS Trusted Advisor AWS VPC Infrastructure Agent metrics and EC2 metadata decoration As with the EC2 API polling integration, when the infrastructure agent is installed on a host and the EC2 namespace is active via AWS CloudWatch metric stream integration, then all the infrastructure agent events and metrics are decorated with additional metadata. The following attributes will decorate infrastructure samples (some might not be applicable on all environments): awsAvailabilityZone, ec2InstanceId, ec2PublicDnsName, ec2State, ec2EbsOptimized, ec2PublicIpAddress, ec2PrivateIpAddress, ec2VpcId, ec2AmiId, ec2PrivateDnsName, ec2KeyName, ec2SubnetId, ec2InstanceType, ec2Hypervisor, ec2Architecture, ec2RootDeviceType, ec2RootDeviceName, ec2VirtualizationType, ec2PlacementGroupName, ec2PlacementGroupTenancy.",

      "body": "Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code software tool built by HashiCorp. You use it to provision all kinds of infrastructure and services, including New Relic dashboards and alerts. Terragrunt is a thin wrapper around Terraform that provides extra tools for: Reducing repetition Working with multiple Terraform modules Managing remote state In this guide, you use Terragrunt to: Generate your Terraform configurations Create files Manage multiple environments Before you begin To use this guide, you should have some basic knowledge of both New Relic and Terraform. If you haven't already: Install the New Relic Infrastructure agent on your host Install the Terraform CLI Install Terragrunt To follow the examples in this guide, you can find example code on GitHub. Create a configuration Terragrunt provides extra tooling for your Terraform configurations. Here, you create a configuration using Terragrunt, Terraform, and New Relic. Step 1 of 14 Initialize a workspace: bash Copy $ mkdir terragrunt-config && cd terragrunt-config Step 2 of 14 In your new folder, create a terragrunt.hcl file: bash Copy $ touch terragrunt.hcl Step 3 of 14 Next, create an environments folder with a subfolder called dev: bash Copy $ mkdir -p environments/dev Step 4 of 14 Then, create a src folder with main.tf and provider.tf files: bash Copy $ mkdir src $ touch src/main.tf $ touch src/provider.tf You configure Terraform resources in main.tf and providers in provider.tf. Step 5 of 14 In src/provider.tf, configure a New Relic provider. terraform { required_version = \"~> 0.14.3\" required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.14.0\" } } } Copy Step 6 of 14 In src/main.tf, add a New Relic alert policy named DemoPolicy: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Copy Step 7 of 14 In environments/dev, create a file named terragrunt.hcl: bash Copy $ touch environments/dev/terragrunt.hcl Step 8 of 14 In it, add the following include statement: include { path = find_in_parent_folders() } Copy This instructs Terragrunt to use any .hcl configuration files it finds in parent folders. Step 9 of 14 Add a terraform block to give Terragrunt a source reference: include { path = find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } Copy Step 10 of 14 In src/provider.tf, configure the New Relic provider with an API key, account ID, and region: terraform { required_version = \"~> 0.14.3\" required_providers { newrelic = { source = \"newrelic/newrelic\" version = \"~> 2.14.0\" } } } variable \"newrelic_personal_apikey\" {} variable \"newrelic_account_id\" {} variable \"newrelic_region\" {} provider \"newrelic\" { account_id = var.newrelic_account_id api_key = var.newrelic_personal_apikey region = var.newrelic_region } Copy You use variables to keep your configuration dynamic. Step 11 of 14 In environments/dev, initialize terragrunt: bash Copy $ terragrunt init This sets up a bit of context, including environment variables, then runs terraform init: bash Copy Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when you run \"terraform init\" in the future. Terraform has been successfully initialized! You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running \"terraform plan\" to see any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands should now work. If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform, rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols: + create Terraform will perform the following actions: # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be created + resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { + account_id = (known after apply) + id = (known after apply) + incident_preference = \"PER_POLICY\" + name = \"My Demo Policy\" } Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note: You didn't specify an \"-out\" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if \"terraform apply\" is subsequently run. Terragrunt provides the inputs block's values. Step 14 of 14 Run terragrunt apply: bash Copy $ terragrunt apply Now your Demo Policy is in your New Relic account. Add to your configuration Now that you've created a basic New Relic configuration, add the configurations from our Getting Started with Terraform and Terraform modules guides. Tip If you haven't done these guides yet, you can copy their configurations from the Terragrunt intro Github repo. Step 1 of 2 In src/main.tf, update the email address in the alert channel to your preferred email address: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { policy_id = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id channel_ids = [ newrelic_alert_channel.DemoChannel.id ] } module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = 88 cpu_warning = 78 diskPercent = 68 } Copy Here, you added a New Relic alert channel, subscribed the demo policy to the alert channel, and added a module hosted on Github. Step 2 of 2 Run terragrunt init and then run terragrunt apply: bash Copy $ terragrunt init $ terragrunt apply After Terraform finishes processing, your alert policy has two conditions and one alert channel. Use your environment as a Terragrunt variable With Terragrunt, you can add the name of the environment you're running to the name of the data you're creating, making your resource more identifiable in New Relic. Step 1 of 9 In the root terragrunt.hcl file, create an input for env_name: inputs = { env_name = \"develop\" } Copy Step 2 of 9 In the src/main.tf, file add a new variable called env_name: variable \"env_name\" {} Copy Step 3 of 9 Add the new env_name variable to the alert policy and alert channel resource blocks: resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { name = \"${var.env_name}: My Demo Policy\" } resource \"newrelic_alert_channel\" \"DemoChannel\" { name = \"${env_name}: My Demo Channel\" type = \"email\" config { recipients = \"your@email_address.com\" include_json_attachment = \"1\" } } Copy Step 4 of 9 Run terragrunt plan to see the environment variable added to your policy name: bash Copy # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"develop: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Here, you hardcoded the environment in terragrunt.hcl. To make this more dynamic, use a terragrunt built-in function to get the environment for you. Step 5 of 9 In the root terragrunt.hcl file, update the input to use path_relative_to_include(), and pass the value as the env_name variable: inputs = { env_name = path_relative_to_include() } Copy Step 6 of 9 Run terragrunt plan: bash Copy # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"environments/dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Note that the env_name variable has the entire ./environments/dev/ path. Instead, you want to include only the \"dev\" part. Step 7 of 9 Update the terragrunt.hcl to strip \"environements/\" from env_name: locals { env_name = replace(path_relative_to_include(), \"environments/\", \"\") } inputs = { env_name = local.env_name } Copy Here, you added a locals block to create a local variable and used the built-in replace function to remove the unwanted parts of the relative path. Then, you updated the inputs block to use the local variable. Step 8 of 9 Run terragrunt plan: bash Copy # newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy will be updated in-place ~ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy\" \"DemoPolicy\" { id = \"1216533\" ~ name = \"My Demo Policy\" -> \"dev: My Demo Policy\" # (2 unchanged attributes hidden) } # newrelic_alert_policy_channel.ChannelSubs must be replaced -/+ resource \"newrelic_alert_policy_channel\" \"ChannelSubs\" { ~ channel_ids = [ - 4737437, ] -> (known after apply) # forces replacement ~ id = \"1216533:4737437\" -> (known after apply) # (1 unchanged attribute hidden) } Plan: 2 to add, 1 to change, 2 to destroy. Your new policy name is \"dev: My Demo Policy\". Step 9 of 9 Run terragrunt apply to update your configurations: bash Copy $ terragrunt apply Move your state to remote storage At the moment, your state file is local. Now, you update your Terraform configurations to store it in Amazon S3. Tip Since Terragrunt allows you to configure multiple environments, you should store state files in their own S3 buckets so they don't overwrite each other. Step 1 of 4 Create an S3 bucket for you development state file. Step 2 of 4 Create an IAM user with permissions to store files in your bucket. Step 3 of 4 In your root terragrunt.hcl, add a remote_state block that tells Terragrunt where to place your file in S3: remote_state { backend = \"s3\" generate = { path = \"backend.tf\" if_exists = \"overwrite_terragrunt\" } config = { bucket = \"YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME\" # Amazon S3 bucket required key = \"envs/${local.env_name}/terraform.tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" encrypt = true profile = \"YOUR_PROFILE_NAME\" # Profile name required } } Copy Here, you defined a remote state configuration that specifies a bucket name, region, encryption, and profile. Make sure you replace the placeholder values with real ones. For key, you used the local env_name you created earlier to dynamically set the environment for the state file. Finally, you told Terragrunt to generate a new file called backend.tf in your bucket. Step 4 of 4 Run terragrunt plan: bash Copy $ terragrunt plan In your bucket, you see a folder named envs. Inside it is a folder called devs containing a terraform.tfstate file. Tip Inside envs/dev, there is a hidden folder named terragrunt-cache. In it, is the backend.tf file that Terragrunt generated. Create a new environment Now that you've configured your development environment, create another that reuses most of your work. Step 1 of 8 Under environments, create a folder named nonprod. In it, create a file called terragrunt.hcl: bash Copy $ mkdir nonprod && cd nonprod $ touch terragrunt.hcl Step 2 of 8 In environments/nonprod/terragrunt.hcl, copy the configuration from the environments/dev/terragrunt.hcl: include { path= find_in_parent_folders() } terraform { source = \"../../src\" } inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) } Copy Tip If you're using a different account for your nonprod environment, update inputs with a new account ID, API key, and region. Step 3 of 8 Inside nonprod, run terragrunt init and terragrunt apply: bash Copy $ terragrunt init $ terragrunt apply Terraform creates a new set of resources prefixed with \"nonprod:\". Now, you've created two environments, dev and nonprod, but they're the same, other than their name. Step 4 of 8 In src/main.tf, add new variables for the Host Conditions module: variable \"cpu_critical\" {default = 89} variable \"cpu_warningl\" {default = 79} variable \"diskPercentage\" {default = 69} Copy Using variables like these makes your configurations more dynamic. Step 5 of 8 Update HostConditions to use the cpu_critical, cpu_warning, and diskPercentage variables: module \"HostConditions\" { source = \"git::https://github.com/jsbnr/demo-terraform.git\" policyId = newrelic_alert_policy.DemoPolicy.id cpu_critical = var.cpu_critical cpu_warning = var.cpu_warninig diskPercent = var.dskPercentage } Copy Step 6 of 8 Run terragrunt plan: bash Copy $ terragrunt plan The HostConditions values now include the variable defaults. Step 7 of 8 In nonprod/terragrunt.hcl, add values for your variables: inputs = { newrelic_personal_apikey = \"NRAK-***\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_account_id = \"12345\" # Your New Relic account ID newrelic_region = \"US\" # US or EU (defaults to US) cpu_critical = 50 cpu_warninig = 40 diskPercentage = 98 } Copy This passes the values into your environment configurations. Step 8 of 8 Run terragrunt apply: bash Copy $ terragrunt apply In your New Relic account, you have a new policy with nonprod-specific configurations. Conclusion Congratulations! You've used Terragrunt to generate New Relic configurations and manage multiple environments. Review the Terragrunt intro example, New Relic Terraform provider documentation, and Terragrunt quick start to learn how you can take your configuration to the next level.",

      "body": "Here's how you build a \"Hello, world!\" application in New Relic One. In this guide, you: Create a local version of the New Relic One site where you prototype your application Share your application with your teammates by publishing it to Instant Observability Before you begin Developing applications requires a New Relic account and the New Relic One CLI (nr1). If you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account. You need publish and subscribe permissions to complete this guide. Install Node.js Complete the CLI quick start Now, you have a Nerdpack, called my-awesome-nerdpack. This Nerdpack has a Nerdlet and a launcher that you named (though, this guide uses the default launcher name, \"launcher\", and Nerdlet name, \"home\"). You use this Nerdpack throughout this guide. Finally, make sure your nr1 is up-to-date: bash Copy $ nr1 update For additional details about setting up your environment, see Set up your development environment and Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. Tip If you use VSCode, we have an extension and an extension pack you can use to build your app. Update and serve your application locally With nr1, you can serve a local build of your Nerdpack to New Relic One. This helps you develop your application in a production-like environment before you publish it. Before you change any code, familiarize yourself with the Nerdpack's directory structure: my-awesome-nerdpack/ ├───README.md ├───launchers/ │ └───launcher/ │ └───nr1.json ├───nerdlets/ │ └───home │ ├───index.js │ ├───nr1.json │ └───styles.scss ├───node_modules/ ├───nr1.json ├───package-lock.json └───package.json Copy The launchers and nerdlets directories contain the logic of your application. It's in these directories that you update most of your code. The nr1.json files throughout the Nerdpack hold metadata about your Nerdpack, Nerdlets, and launchers. Tip Read our documentation to learn more about the Nerdpack file structure. Step 1 of 6 In my-awesome-nerdpack/nerdlets/home/index.js, change the default return message to \"Hello, world!\": import React from 'react'; // https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction export default class HomeNerdlet extends React.Component { render() { return <h1>Hello, world!</h1>; } } Copy Step 2 of 6 As an optional step, you can add a custom launcher icon using any image named icon.png. In launchers/launcher, add an image called icon.png: my-awesome-nerdpack/ ├───README.md ├───launchers/ │ └───launcher/ │ ├───icon.png │ └───nr1.json ├───nerdlets/ │ └───home │ ├───index.js │ ├───nr1.json │ └───styles.scss ├───node_modules/ ├───nr1.json ├───package-lock.json └───package.json Copy This creates an icon for your launcher. In the root directory, add the same image: my-awesome-nerdpack/ ├───README.md ├───icon.png ├───launchers/ │ └───launcher/ │ ├───icon.png │ └───nr1.json ├───nerdlets/ │ └───home │ ├───index.js │ ├───nr1.json │ └───styles.scss ├───node_modules/ ├───nr1.json ├───package-lock.json └───package.json Copy This sets the icon for the app details page. Step 3 of 6 Next, change the name of the launcher to something more meaningful. In my-awesome-nerdpack/launchers/launcher/nr1.json, change the displayName to \"Hello world\": { \"schemaType\": \"LAUNCHER\", \"id\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-launcher\", \"description\": \"Describe me\", \"displayName\": \"Hello world\", \"rootNerdletId\": \"my-awesome-nerdpack-nerdlet\" } Copy Step 4 of 6 To see your new changes locally, start a local Node server from within the Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:serve Found and loaded 2 nr1.json files on MyAwesomeNerdpack (123a4b95-678c-9012-3456-d7e8f90g1hi2) Nerdpack.

Step 5 of 6 Use the url at the bottom of the output to open your launcher: bash Copy Launchers: ⁎ launcher https://onenr.io/0JBQrggmDwZ ℹ You can use \"npm start -- --mode=prod\" to run the development server in prod mode. Step 6 of 6 Here, you see your Nerdlet with your \"Hello, world!\" message: Publish your application Because you're serving your Nerdpack locally, your colleagues can't see it. When you're ready, publish it to Instant Observability, our unified catalog of integrations, dashboards, alerts, Nerdpacks, and more. Read our documentation to learn about Nerdpack permissions if you have trouble publishing your Nerdpack. Step 1 of 3 From its root directory, publish your Nerdpack: bash Copy $ nr1 nerdpack:publish Found and loaded 2 nr1.json files on MyAwesomeNerdpack (123a4b95-678c-9012-3456-d7e8f90g1hi2) Nerdpack.

Step 2 of 3 In New Relic, click Instant Observability: Step 3 of 3 Find and click your new Nerdpack: When your new application opens, notice that it doesn't display any descriptive information. The next section shows you how to add descriptive metadata. Describe your project with catalog details Now that your new application is in Instant Observability, you can add information to help users understand what your application does and how to use it. Step 1 of 4 In your Nerdpack's root directory, execute the following: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type catalog ✔ created: launchers/launcher/catalog ✔ created: nerdlets/home/catalog ✔ catalog created successfully! catalog is available at \"./catalog\" This creates three directories: launchers/launcher/catalog: This holds launcher screenshots nerdlets/home/catalog: This holds Nerdlet screenshots catalog: This holds documentation, screenshots, a description, and more information about your Nerdpack Tip If you had other launchers, Nerdlets, or custom visualizations, they would also get catalog directories from this command. Here's how the results look in your project: my-awesome-nerdpack/ ├───README.md ├───icon.png ├───catalog/ │ ├───README.md │ ├───additionalInfo.md │ ├───config.json │ ├───documentation.md │ └───screenshots/ ├───launchers/ │ └───launcher/ │ ├───icon.png │ ├───catalog/ │ │ └───screenshots/ │ └───nr1.json ├───nerdlets/ │ └───home │ ├───index.js │ ├───nr1.json │ ├───catalog/ │ │ └───screenshots/ │ └───styles.scss ├───node_modules/ ├───nr1.json ├───package-lock.json └───package.json Copy Step 2 of 4 In the root catalog directory of your project, add screenshots or various types of metadata to describe your project. You can also add screenshots in the catalog directories of your launcher or Nerdlet. For details about what you can add, see Update your Nerdpack's catalog metadata. Step 3 of 4 After you add the screenshots and descriptions you want, execute the following to save your metadata to the Instant Observability catalog: bash Copy $ nr1 catalog:submit Step 4 of 4 Return to Instant Observability and refresh the page to see your new screenshots and metadata describing your project. And if you added screenshots to your launcher or Nerdlet, you can see them under What's inside: Subscribe accounts to your application You need to subscribe to your application to use it. To learn about what users on your account have the ability to subscribe, read our permissions documentation. Step 1 of 5 If you're not already there, navigate to your application in Instant Observability: Step 2 of 5 On your application's description page, click Add this app: Step 3 of 5 Select the accounts that you want to subscribe to the application, then update your accounts: Step 4 of 5 Go to the Apps page: Here, you find the apps your accounts are susbscribed to.

      "body": "Problem You’re attempting to enable serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda and are having an issue or error. Solution There are two common problems related to not completing all of the enablement procedures: Not seeing data on CloudWatch metrics UI page. This means the AWS integration step wasn't completed. Not seeing data on Troubleshooting category UI pages. If you aren't seeing data on the Distributed tracing, Errors, and Invocations UI tabs, this means the APM agent instrumentation step wasn't completed. Besides these basic enablement problems, there are some additional problems that may cause an issue: CloudWatch error \"HTTP error 401: unauthorized.\" This is due to an incorrect API Key. The --nr-api-keyargument in the Configure AWS enable step takes your user key, which is different from the REST API key. Custom metrics are missing. Lambda monitoring is not compatible with our custom metrics. Use custom attributes to add metadata. Invocations missing. To see invocation breakdown details, distributed tracing must be enabled as part of the Lambda instrumentation step. Distributed tracing is required so that span details can be displayed in the invocation details pane. You've completed the installation, integration, and instrumentation steps correctly, and your function is sending logs to CloudWatch but you're not seeing traces for specific dependencies (or any traces) in the UI. This may result from the order of layer merging (if you're using our Lambda layers) or from the order of import (if you're instrumenting manually): If you're instrumenting with layers: make sure in your function configuration that the New Relic layer is merged before other layers (though if your function uses webpack, the New Relic layer should be merged after the webpack layer). If you're instrumenting a Node function manually, make sure that your function imports newrelic and @newrelic/aws-sdk before it imports any dependencies you expect to monitor. If none of these solutions help you, contact our support team. The following information will help you when you talk to support technicians: Has the Lambda function appeared in the UI before? If so, what is the name of the function? If some data for the Lambda function is appearing in the UI, what specific data is appearing? What APM language agent are you using to instrument the function? Recommended: Attach your CloudWatch logs to the ticket To provide our support team with logging information when opening a ticket: Invoke the function in AWS Lambda. Click on the logs link after your function runs. This will take you to the CloudWatch logs in AWS. On the left-hand sidebar in AWS, under Logs, click on Insights. Select your function and also the newrelic-log-ingestion stream. Apply an appropriate Time Filter, and a log entry limit (the default of 20 may not be enough). Under Actions select Copy query results (ASCII). Paste the copied text into a new text file, then save and upload the text file to the ticket. Important The NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING payload contains all the information the agent attempts to send up, including metrics, events, some AWS account metadata, invocations and errors data. Note that some of that data (for example, our legacy metrics) will not make it to our UI because our ingest pipeline does not consume them.",

      "body": "New Relic's Java agent includes built-in instrumentation of the most popular parts of the Java ecosystem, including app servers, frameworks, databases, and message queuing systems. For frameworks and libraries that are not instrumented out of the box, you can extend the agent with Java custom instrumentation. Want to try out New Relic's Java agent? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Requirements to install the agent Before you install the Java agent, ensure your system meets these requirements: JVM Tip The Java agent is compatible with any JVM-based language, including: Java, Scala, Kotlin, and Clojure. For instrumentation support for language-specific features, see the Automatically instrumented frameworks and libraries section below. In order to continue to innovate and efficiently provide new capabilities to our customers, we'll occasionally need to drop support for older JVM versions. When that happens, you can continue using a version of the agent that supports your older JVM version, but new features and fixes won't be included in those older agent versions. We recommend upgrading to a currently supported JVM version to take advantage of the latest agent releases. Please see the table of compatible agent versions to determine which JVM versions are compatible. Java version Compatible agent versions Java 5 Agent v1.3.0 to v2.21.7 Java 6 Agent v3.0.0 to v4.3.0 Java 7 Agent v3.0.0 to v6.5.0 and v6.5.2 Java 8 Agent v3.10.0 to current Java 9 Agent v3.43.0 to current Java 10 Agent v4.4.0 to current Java 11 Agent v4.7.0 to current Java 12 Agent v4.12.0 to current Java 13 Agent v5.7.0 to current Java 14 Agent v5.11.0 to current Java 15 Agent v6.1.0 to current Java 16 Agent v7.3.0 to current Java 17 Agent v7.4.0 to current Compatible: IBM JVM versions 8 for Linux Eclipse OpenJ9 versions 8 to 13 for Linux, Windows, and macOS OpenJDK and AdoptOpenJDK JVM versions 8 to 16 for Linux, Windows, and macOS Oracle Hotspot JVM versions 8 to 16 for Linux, Solaris, Windows, and macOS Azul Zing JVM versions 8 and 11 for Linux, Windows, and macOS Azul Zulu JVM versions 8 to 12 for Linux, Windows, and macOS Amazon Corretto JVM versions 8 and 11 for Linux, Windows, and macOS Alibaba Dragonwell JVM versions 8 and 11 for Linux, Windows, and macOS (Java 1.7) Compatible only with Java agent 6.5.x [ ZIP | 15.4 MB] legacy agent: OpenJDK and AdoptOpenJDK JVM versions 7 IBM JVM version 7 Oracle Hotspot JVM version 7 for Linux, Solaris, Windows, macOS (Java 1.6) Compatible only with Java agent 4.3.x [ ZIP | 9.9 MB] legacy agent: Apple Hotspot JVM version 6 for macOS IBM JVM version 6 Oracle Hotspot JVM version 6.0 for Linux, Solaris, Windows, macOS (Java 1.5) Compatible only with Java agent 2.21.x [ ZIP | 2.8 MB] legacy agent: Oracle Hotspot JVM version 5.0 for Linux, Solaris, Windows, macOS (Java SE 5.0) Oracle JRockit up to and including 1.6.0_50 Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Use of other monitoring software If your application uses other application monitoring software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Built-in instrumentation After you install the Java agent, it automatically instruments many popular frameworks and libraries. With automatic instrumentation, the agent collects rich data out of the box, and data will show up in your New Relic dashboards within minutes of installation. Even if your library is not automatically instrumented, you can still collect data with custom instrumentation and the Java agent API. The agent automatically instruments these frameworks and libraries: App/Web servers The agent automatically instruments the following app/web servers.

After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Java agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. New Relic One dashboards The Java agent sends default events and attributes to dashboards, or you can run NRQL queries in the query builder. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from Synthetics monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

      "body": "The New Relic Lambda monitoring stack There are several important parts to Lambda monitoring: Your function The New Relic agent or SDK The New Relic Lambda Extension New Relic's backend The New Relic One Lambda UI Your function Your function is the code you want to understand. You want to know when it's encountering errors, why it's slow, or how often it gets invoked. New Relic agent or SDK This is a library that New Relic provides for the language that your function is written in. Its job is to do the actual monitoring of your code. It measures the duration of your function invocations, notes errors that occur, records details about the source events, and your functions responses. To do this, it needs to wrap around your Lambda invocation handler function. With a bit more work on your part, you can break your invocation into interesting segments, and tie together the interaction of your function with other functions and services, providing a holistic view of your serverless application. New Relic Lambda Extension This sidecar process runs inside the Lambda execution environment, alongside your code. It enhances the telemetry that the agent collects, and sends it to New Relic's back end in batches. It can also send your function's logs to New Relic. The extension is a small application that integrates tightly with the AWS Lambda lifecycle, and works to minimize both the time it takes your telemetry to arrive at New Relic, and the impact that instrumentation has on your function's latency and throughput. See more about our Lambda extension. New Relic's backend The New Relic service receives your telemetry, processes it into AwsLambdaInvocation, AwsLambdaInvocationError, Span, and custom events, and stores all that in our telemetry database: NRDB. Lambda UI in New Relic One Lambda functions aren't quite like traditional services, so the experience of managing them is a little different from the classic APM experience. Inside New Relic One, Lambda functions have a custom UI, which quickly surfaces the most important information about your function, and integrates closely with our logging and distributed tracing features. Backed by NRDB and NRQL, you can also write custom dashboards and alerts for your functions. The legacy CloudWatch path Older integrations send telemetry in a slightly different way. Instead of passing telemetry off to the extension, the agent writes it out to CloudWatch as a log line. By adding a log subscription filter to pipe your function logs into the aws-log-ingestion Lambda function, we can recover that Cloudwatch log line, and forward it on to New Relic, along with some other platform telemetry. In the past, we've seen that this approach has some considerable drawbacks. The AWS CloudWatch service can generate a lot of data. If you're on the free tier, you may hit your data limit pretty quickly. If you're paying for data, you may find this service making up the largest share of the data you're sending to New Relic.",

      "body": "On this page, you will learn how to manually instrument your lambda function. It's organized by runtime language. Go To instrument your Go-language Lambda: Download our Go agent package and place it in the same directory as your function. Install the agent: go get -u github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic. Install the nrlambda integration go get -u github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/integrations/nrlambda. In your Lambda code, import our components, create an application, and update how you start your Lambda. See our instrumentation examples: Extension repo Go agent repo Optional: Add custom events that will be associated with your Lambda invocation by using the RecordCustomEvent API. For example: func handler(ctx context.Context) { if txn := newrelic.FromContext(ctx); nil != txn { txn.Application().RecordCustomEvent(\"MyEvent\", map[string]interface{}{ \"zip\": \"zap\", }) } fmt.Println(\"hello world!\") } Copy Build and zip your Lambda function and upload it to AWS. Zip and upload recommendations Here are suggestions for zipping and uploading the Lambda: Build the binary for execution on Linux. This produces a binary file called main. You can use: $ GOOS=linux go build -o main Copy Zip the binary into a deployment package using: $ zip deployment.zip main Copy Upload the zip file to AWS using either the AWS Lambda console or the AWS CLI. Name the handler main (to match the name given during the binary build). The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a child account, this is the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To configure logging, see Go agent logging. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Java Monitoring for AWS Lambda in Java doesn't use our APM Java agent. Instead, it uses these two OpenTracing dependencies: AWS Lambda OpenTracing Java SDK: OpenTracing instrumentation for AWS Lambda RequestHandler and RequestStreamHandler. Our AWS Lambda OpenTracing Tracer: An OpenTracing Tracer implementation designed to monitor AWS Lambda. It generates spans, error events, transaction events, error traces, and provides distributed tracing support. Tip Supported OpenTracing Versions OpenTracing 0.31.0: Lambda Tracer: com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:1.1.1 Lambda SDK: com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:1.0.0 OpenTracing 0.32.0, 0.33.0: Lambda Tracer: com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:2.2.1 Lambda SDK: com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:2.1.0 To instrument your Java Lambda: In your project’s build.gradle file, include our OpenTracing AWS Lambda Tracer and the AWS Lambda OpenTracing SDK dependencies: dependencies { compile(\"com.newrelic.opentracing:java-aws-lambda:2.1.0\") compile(\"com.newrelic.opentracing:newrelic-java-lambda:2.2.1\") compile(\"io.opentracing:opentracing-util:0.33.0\") } Copy Implement the AWS Lambda RequestHandler interface as shown in the Java Lambda example and override the doHandleRequest method. In the doHandleRequest method, call the LambdaTracing.instrument(...) API to create a root span to trace the lambda function's execution. This is also where you will define your business logic for the lambda function. Register a LambdaTracer.INSTANCE as the OpenTracing Global tracer, as shown in the Java Lambda example. Create a ZIP deployment package and upload it to AWS Lambda. Or deploy it via other means. In the AWS Lambda console, set the handler. For the example Java Lambda, the handler would be com.handler.example.MyLambdaHandler::handleRequest. Because handleRequest is assumed, you could also use com.handler.example.MyLambdaHandler. The following AWS console environment variables are required if you want your Lambda function to be included in distributed tracing. This is recommended. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_PRIMARY_APPLICATION_ID. This is also your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a child account, this must be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: In the Lambda console, enable debug logging by adding this environment variable: NEW_RELIC_DEBUG is true. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Please see the AWS Lambda distributed tracing example for a complete project that illustrates common use cases such as: Distributed tracing between Lambda functions Manual span creation (aka custom instrumentation) Tracing external calls Adding custom attributes (aka Tags) to spans .NET Core Our monitoring of .NET Core-based AWS Lambda functions doesn't use our standard .NET Core APM agent. Instead, it uses a NuGet package. To instrument your .NET Core Lambda: In your Lambda Functions project, install the NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.Tracer NuGet package. Note: NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.Tracer depends on version 1.2.0+ of Amazon.Lambda.APIGatewayEvent NuGet package. If the environment already uses a lower version of Amazon.Lambda.APIGatewayEvent, the New Relic package may produce errors such as System.MissingMethodException . Import the NuGet package and OpenTracing utils: using OpenTracing.Util; using NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda; Copy Instrument your function, as shown in this example: public class Function { static Function() { // Register The NewRelic Lambda Tracer Instance GlobalTracer.Register(NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.LambdaTracer.Instance); } public object FunctionWrapper(ILambdaContext context) { // Instantiate NewRelic TracingWrapper and pass your FunctionHandler as // an argument return new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper(FunctionHandler, context); } /// <summary> /// A simple function that takes a string and does a ToUpper /// </summary> /// <param name=\"input\"></param> /// <param name=\"context\"></param> /// <returns></returns> public object FunctionHandler(ILambdaContext context) { ... } } Copy Tip The arguments passed to FunctionWrapper must match the signature of FunctionHandler. If your handler function returns a Task, the Lambda wrapper will block on the return task until it completes, so that it can measure the duration and capture exceptions, if any are present. In addition, you may also inherit from the APIGatewayProxyFunction. For an example, see below: Async handler function public async Task<int> FunctionHandlerAsync(ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { return await new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper( ActualFunctionHandlerAsync, lambdaContext); } public async Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> ActualFunctionHandlerAsync(ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { // Function can make other async operations here ... } Copy Inheriting from APIGatewayProxyFunction public class LambdaFunction : APIGatewayProxyFunction { static LambdaFunction() { // Register The NewRelic Lambda Tracer Instance OpenTracing.Util.GlobalTracer.Register(NewRelic.OpenTracing.AmazonLambda.LambdaTracer.Instance); } public override Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> FunctionHandlerAsync(APIGatewayProxyRequest request, ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> task = new TracingRequestHandler().LambdaWrapper(ActualFunctionHandlerAsync, request, lambdaContext); return task; } public Task<APIGatewayProxyResponse> ActualFunctionHandlerAsync(APIGatewayProxyRequest request, ILambdaContext lambdaContext) { return base.FunctionHandlerAsync(request, lambdaContext); } } Copy Optional for SQS and SNS: Starting in version 1.0 of our .NET Lambda Tracer, distributed tracing support has been added for SQS and SNS. To enable distributed tracing for SQS or SNS you will need to complete the items in this step as well as setup the environment variables in the step that follows this one. Important Enabling distributed tracing support for SQS and SNS will disable automatic instrumentation for both of SQS and SNS and require the use of these wrappers to instrument them. Set the NEW_RELIC_USE_DT_WRAPPER environment variable to true. To instrument SQS and SNS calls you will need to use the provided wrappers. Using the SQS Wrapper The SQS wrapper supports wrapping the following methods: Amazon.SQS.AmazonSQSClient.SendMessageAsync(...) Amazon.SQS.AmazonSQSClient.SendMessageBatchAsync(...) Examples // SQS Client AmazonSQSClient client = new AmazonSQSClient(\"AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\", AWS_REGION); // SendMessageRequest SendMessageRequest sendRequest = new SendMessageRequest(\"QUEUE_URI_STRING\", \"An SQS Message\"); Task<SendMessageResponse> responseOne = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageAsync, sendRequest); // String-based Task<SendMessageResponse> responseTwo = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageAsync, \"QUEUE_URI_STRING\", \"Another SQS Message\"); // SendMessageBatchRequest List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry> batchEntries = new List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry>(); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id1\", \"First SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id2\", \"Second SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id3\", \"Third SQS Message\")); SendMessageBatchRequest sendBatchRequest = new SendMessageBatchRequest(QUEUE_URI, batchEntries); Task<SendMessageBatchResponse> response = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageBatchAsync, sendBatchRequest); // SendMessageBatchRequestEntry List List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry> moreBatchEntries = new List<SendMessageBatchRequestEntry>(); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id4\", \"Fourth SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id5\", \"Fifth SQS Message\")); batchEntries.Add(new SendMessageBatchRequestEntry(\"id6\", \"Sixth SQS Message\")); Task<SendMessageBatchResponse> response = SQSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.SendMessageBatchAsync, moreBatchEntries); Copy Using the SNS Wrapper The SNS wrapper supports wrapping the following methods: Amazon.SimpleNotificationService.AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient.PublishAsync(...) Examples // SNS Client AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient client = new Amazon.SimpleNotificationService.AmazonSimpleNotificationServiceClient(\"AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\", AWS_REGION); // PublishRequest - Phone Number PublishRequest phonePublishRequest = new PublishRequest(); phonePublishRequest.PhoneNumber = +1XXX5555100; phonePublishRequest.Message = \"An SNS Message for phones\"; Task<PublishResponse> phoneResponse = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, phonePublishRequest); // PublishRequest - ARN PublishRequest publishRequest = new PublishRequest(\"TOPIC_ARN\", \"An SNS Message\"); Task<PublishResponse> publishResponse = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, publishRequest); // String-based without subject Task<PublishResponse> ResponseOne = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, \"TOPIC_ARN\", \"Another SNS Message\"); // String-based with subject Task<PublishResponse> ResponseTwo = SNSWrapper.WrapRequest(client.PublishAsync, \"TOPIC_ARN\", \"Yet Another SNS Message\", \"A Subject\"); Copy The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS Lambda console: NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: The account ID the Lambda is reporting to. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY: This is also the account ID. If your account is a child account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Ensure that the wrapper function (FunctionWrapper in above example) is set up as the function handler. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Node.js To instrument your Node.js Lambda: Download our Node.js agent package and place it in the same directory as your function, ensuring the agent is installed as a dependency in the node_modules directory. Use the Node Package Manager: npm install newrelic --save Copy Install our AWS SDK module alongside the Node.js agent: npm install @newrelic/aws-sdk --save Copy In your Lambda code, require the agent module and the AWS SDK at the top of the file, and wrap the handler function. For example: const newrelic = require('newrelic'); require('@newrelic/aws-sdk'); // Other module loads go under the two require statements above module.exports.handler = newrelic.setLambdaHandler((event, context, callback) => { // This is your handler function code console.log('Lambda executed'); callback(); }); Copy Optional: You can also add custom events to your Lambda using the recordCustomEvent API. For example: module.exports.handler = newrelic.setLambdaHandler((event, context, callback) => { newrelic.recordCustomEvent(‘MyEventType’, {foo: ‘bar’}); console.log('Lambda executed'); callback(); }); Copy Zip your Lambda function and the Node.js agent folder together. Requirements and recommendations: The New Relic files outside the New Relic agent folder don't need to be included. If your Lambda function file name is, for example, lambda_function.node, we recommend naming your zip file lambda_function.zip. Do not use a tarball. Your Lambda and its associated modules must all be in the zip file's root directory. This means that if you zip a folder that contains the files, it won't work. Upload the zipped file to your AWS Lambda account. In the AWS console, set these environment variables: NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE. Set to true if not using a configuration file. NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME: Your application name. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a child account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To run the agent in serverless mode outside of AWS in a local environment, set the environment variable NEW_RELIC_SERVERLESS_MODE_ENABLED to true. (When executing this in an AWS Lambda environment, the agent will automatically run in serverless mode. Do not use this variable if you're running in AWS.) Optional: To enable logging in serverless mode, set these environment variables: Set NEW_RELIC_LOG_ENABLED to true. Set NEW_RELIC_LOG to stdout for output to CloudWatch, or set to any writeable file location. The log level is set to info by default. See other log levels. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. Our wrapper gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next you'll configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic. Python To instrument your Python Lambda: Download our Python agent package and place it in the same directory as your function. To do this, use pip: pip install -t . newrelic Copy Important If you use Homebrew, you may get this error: DistutilsOptionError: must supply either home or prefix/exec-prefix -- not both. For details, see the Homebrew GitHub post. In your Lambda code, import the Python agent module and decorate the handler function using the New Relic decorator. The New Relic package must be imported first in your code. Here's an example: import newrelic.agent newrelic.agent.initialize() @newrelic.agent.lambda_handler() def handler(event, context): ... Copy Optional: You can also add custom events to your Lambda using the record_custom_event API. Here's an example: @newrelic.agent.lambda_handler() def handler(event, context): newrelic.agent.record_custom_event('CustomEvent', {'foo': 'bar'}) … Copy Zip your lambda_function.py and newrelic/ folder together using these guidelines: The New Relic files outside the newrelic/ folder don't need to be included. If your Lambda function file name is, for example, lambda_function.py, name your zip file lambda_function.zip. Do not use a tarball. Your Lambda and its associated modules must all be in the zip file's root directory. This means that if you zip a folder that contains the files, it won't work. Upload the zipped file to your AWS Lambda account. In the AWS console, set this environment variable: NEW_RELIC_SERVERLESS_MODE_ENABLED. Set to true The following environment variables are not required for Lambda monitoring to function but they are required if you want your Lambda functions to be included in distributed traces. To enable distributed tracing, set these environment variables in the AWS console: NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED. Set to true. NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID. Your account ID. NEW_RELIC_TRUSTED_ACCOUNT_KEY. This is also your account ID. If your account is a child account, this needs to be the account ID for the root/parent account. Optional: To configure logging, use the NEW_RELIC_LOG and NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL environment variables in the AWS Console. Invoke the Lambda at least once. This creates a CloudWatch log group, which must be present for the next step to work. The New Relic decorator gathers data about the Lambda execution, generates a JSON message, and logs it to CloudWatch Logs. Next, configure CloudWatch to send those logs to New Relic.",

      "body": "This document is a template for an API tutorial document: Please skim the entire template first to understand the expected structure for this type of doc. Then, clone this doc using the Clone content link in the Page tools box. Delete all content up to Introduction (this heading won't be visible). For the doc title (the field at top of page): Doc should be named in a practical, use-case-focused way. Example: Add custom attributes to transactions Introduction (this heading will not be visible) Provide a brief explanation of what this document will teach customers, and why it is valuable for customers to know how to do that. Focus on the value the API provides to the customers and mention specific, common use cases. Any relevant notes about support/compatability should go here, too. Here's an example from the Java API asynchronous tutorial doc: New Relic for Java includes an API to instrument asynchronous activity. For supported frameworks, the Java agent usually instruments async work automatically. However, the async API can be useful for adding more detail to your data. This document provides examples of using tokens and segments to instrument your app. Optional: Provide an overview for complex processes This is an optional section for complicated tutorials that involve either using several methods in one procedure or that have different alternate steps you can take to achieve similar results. This section can link to lower-down sections to allow users to skip around as needed. For simple tutorials, this section isn't necessary. For an example, see this section of the Java async tutorial. Provide a procedure to accomplish the task Tell the user how to accomplish the task, and link to the methods necessary to accomplish that task. As much as possible, we're looking to describe tasks in \"procedures\" (procedure is tech writer jargon for a series of numbered steps). This may be tough to do for fairly open-ended/variable tasks, but it will usually be possible to chunk the content at a fairly high-level to make it into a procedure. Along the way, explain what the importance of the procedure step is, and how one might verify that the step was done correctly. For code samples, avoid using large chunks of code. Instead, use smaller pieces of code and give context for how they are being used. (If you think a large app code example would be helpful, place that later in the doc in the Example section.) Tip For an example of an open-ended task segmented into procedural chunks, see the Asynchronous doc section Connecting async threads. For another example, see this TomCat GAE Flex procedure. Base your procedure on the simple structure below. Tech writers will edit your content to match our style and formatting requirements: Step 1. Do something... Methods and example code to implement the first step. For each step, if applicable, indicate the significance of that step (why it's important) and how the user might verify that the step was done correctly (for example, something showing up in UI, or running a verification test of some sort). If needed: Step 2. Do something else... Methods and example code to implement step 2. If needed: Step 3. Do something else... Methods and example code to implement step 3. Last step. Verify that the task was completed... Explain how a user would know they'd completed the task correctly. In particular, how would the user find the new change or data in the New Relic UI. What New Relic products and pages would the change be noticed on? If new data shows up in Insights, what event types can it be found under? Optional: Do something else with the API Same as above. Make as many headings and separate procedures as needed. Optional: Large example code block If you think a large app code example would be useful, place here. Within any code block, explain all New Relic functions/methods, not just the main methods. Instead of in-line comments, consider using highlighted sections underneath the code block to give additional context. Here's an example: Code block example The following code example shows a segment starting in the storeItem method to measure how long the Lambda statement is waiting in the thread pool. To stop timing the segment, you must call either .end() or .ignore(). If you don't want to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .ignore(). Otherwise, to report the segment as part of its parent transaction, call .end(). private void storeItem(long id) { Segment segment = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction(). startSegment(\"storeItem\") ; segment. reportAsExternal (DatastoreParameters .product(\"H2\") .collection(null) .operation(\"insert\") .instance(\"localhost\", 8080) .databaseName(\"test\") .build()); // fire and forget DB_POOL.submit(() -> { segment.end(); insertData(id); }); } Copy The agent API calls in this sample are: startSegment(...): Begins the segment that will time the code. For more on this method, see the Javadoc. reportAsExternal(DatastoreParameters()): Associates the time with a datastore external call This will show up in APM with datastore data. For more information, see reportAsExternal API. segment.end(): Stops timing this segment. For more on this method, see the Javadoc.

      "body": "New Relic provides integrations and quickstarts for many popular services and frameworks. If you have New Relic and want to report data from a service we don't have an integration for, there are several ways New Relic lets you create your own integration: With New Relic infrastructure monitoring, you can use our lightweight Flex tool (recommended, documented below) or, to build a complete on-host integration, see our Integrations SDK. Telemetry (metrics, traces) monitoring solutions: Use our Telemetry SDKs. Build a custom New Relic One application that uses your own JavaScript UI functionality. What is Flex? New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one tool that allows you to collect metric data from a wide variety of services. It comes bundled with our infrastructure agent. You can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text): you create a YAML config file, start the Infrastructure agent, and your data is reported to New Relic. Flex can send event and metric data to New Relic from a wide range of sources. Using a simple YAML config file, you can run HTTP/HTTPS requests, run shell commands, and parse file content. You can also use standard regex expressions to customize and control the data gathered from those inputs. See an example config. After collecting and cleaning up the data, you can then query Flex data in New Relic, create custom charts for it, and use that data in your dashboards. Requirements Flex comes bundled with our infrastructure agent. To use Flex, you need: Infrastructure agent version 1.10.7 or higher (update | check version) running on Linux, Windows, or Kubernetes. How does Flex work? Flex uses our infrastructure agent to execute commands that generate the data you want to report. Here's a brief overview of how Flex works to report data: You define the data you want to report in a YAML configuration file, located in the infrastructure agent package. See an example configuration: Example config The following is an example of a Flex configuration for monitoring the uptime of a Linux server. This configuration is placed in a file named flex-uptime.yml. This would be placed in the infrastructure agent's integration configuration section, located at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/flex-uptime.yml. integrations: - name: nri-flex config: name: linuxUptimeIntegration apis: - name: Uptime commands: - run: 'cat /proc/uptime' split: horizontal split_by: \\s+ set_header: [uptimeSeconds,idletimeSeconds] Copy Some notes on what this configuration does: run defines the command to execute. The name indicated by name: Uptime is appended with Sample to generate an event called UptimeSample. The name should not start with the ESX or PCF prefix. The split_by: \\s+ splits the fields based on the space character. The command generates attributes attached to the UptimeSample event. The attributes are named uptimeSeconds and idletimeSeconds. The infrastructure agent runs Flex at a frequency based on its own configuration (default: every 30 seconds) and sends the data to New Relic. You can then query your data, create custom charts with it, and add it to dashboards. Learn more The Flex integration comes bundled with the infrastructure agent. Learn more about requirements.

New Relic provides working minimal examples as a starting point for instrumenting your own serverless functions, so that you can become familiar with the necessary elements, test the account link, and use them as a reference for your own instrumentation. While there are many ways to manage and deploy Lambda functions, AWS CloudFormation is the mechanism we use for our examples. It requires minimal tooling, has first-party support, and underpins many of the third party deployment options as well. Example features Each of our basic examples is functionally identical, and illustrates the following New Relic features: Sending invocation telemetry to New Relic, via the New Relic Lambda Extension Adding custom attributes to the invocation event Adding custom events to the telemetry In addition, each demonstrates: Using the New Relic Lambda layer with your function Adding permissions to the function to access the AWS Secrets Manager and retrieve the New Relic license key Runtime-specific techinques for wrapping your handler, so that New Relic can capture telemetry Managing function log retention in CloudWatch Optionally, forwarding function logs to New Relic's logging product via the Lambda Extension Examples Our examples are published, alongside the New Relic Lambda Extension, in this GitHub repository. There's one for each Lambda runtime that New Relic can instrument: NodeJS Python Go Java .NET Tip As you test the examples, you may notice that telemetry isn't always sent right away. The AWS Lambda lifecycle places certain constraints on the execution of our agent and Lambda Extension. In addition, valuable platform telemetry is only available after an invocation has completed. The New Relic Extension balances overall performance against the need for timely telemetry delivery by buffering telemetry for a period of time, and delivering it to New Relic in batches, during a subsequent invocation (or during shutdown). In a production function, we find this works very well. When manually testing, it's often necessary to wait seven seconds, and then invoke a function again to give it an opportunity to deliver previously buffered telemetry. While we make an effort to keep the templates in our examples up to date, you can always find the latest New Relic Lambda layer for your region and runtime at our layers site. This site also offers an API, which you're welcome to use in your CI/CD pipeline to keep your own templates up to date. Distributed tracing In addition to our basic examples, we offer an example of how to integrate distributed tracing into a non-trivial serverless application in our distributed tracing example. It illustrates manual trace propagation for SQS and SNS, two of the more popular services that might invoke Lambda functions, with Node, Python and Java functions.",

Take the next steps to monitor your Amazon SagaMaker metrics and objects (that are sent to AWS CloudWatch) and view them as entities and dashboards in New Relic. Stream AWS CloudWatch Metrics to New Relic Start benefiting from New Relic MLOps entities in a single simple step (and just a few minutes!): Important Each metric sent to CloudWatch is automatically sent to New Relic's metric table in NRDB, according to the namespace filter. You can always query them using NRQL: FROM Metric SELECT * WHERE aws.Namespace='/aws/sagemaker/Endpoints' LIMIT MAX SINCE 1 WEEK AGO Copy Manual option Follow our docs to set up CloudWatch Metric Streams. Automated option You may automate the set up with the Terraform code: module \"example_usage\" { source = \"modules/nr-cloudwatch-metric-stream\" name_suffix = \"suffix\" # optional aws_account_id = \"your-aws-account-id\" newrelic_collector_endpoint = \"newrelic-endpoint-url\" newrelic_trusted_account_id = \"12345678\" newrelic_license_key = \"your-newrelic-license-key\" } Copy When calling the module, please write the correct newrelic_collector_endpoint: HTTP endpoint URL - US datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 When you set the metric stream you can choose to stream the metric from all the namespaces, or you can specify namespaces. Important You can view each entity's metrics in a dashboard that's created automatically when the metrics arrive at the New Relic. Monitor your data and model in Amazon SageMaker, and send the metrics to CloudWatch SageMaker automatically monitors your endpoints’ performance, and sends statistic metrics to CloudWatch. For more information, see Endpoint CloudWatch Metrics. To obtain more benefits from the Amazon SageMaker MLOps integration, use the Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor tools. You'll have to define scheduled monitoring jobs to monitor the quality of your machine learning models in production and send metrics to CloudWatch. The Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor provides the following types of monitoring: Monitor Data Quality: Monitor drift in data quality. Example notebook: Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor Namespace: aws/sagemaker/Endpoints/data-metrics Monitor Model Quality: Monitor drift in model quality metrics, such as accuracy. Example notebook: Amazon SageMaker Model Quality Monitor Namespace: aws/sagemaker/Endpoints/model-metrics Monitor Bias Drift for Models in Production: Monitor bias in you model's predictions.

Example notebook: Monitoring bias drift and feature attribution drift Amazon SageMaker Clarify Namespace: aws/sagemaker/Endpoints/explainability-metrics Advanced options You can aso publish metric data points to Amazon CloudWatch and define the namespaces and one of the above using the put_metric_data function. If you use your own algorithm for hyperparameter tuning, make sure that it sends at least one metric by writing evaluation data to stderr or stdout. Read more on how to define metrics in automatic model tuning. See also the example notebook Develop, Train, Optimize and Deploy Scikit-Learn Random Forest. Explore your MLOps entities and dashboards We generate aws-entities (under the MLOps entity domain) for the detailed namespaces. For these entities, you can get out-of-the-box dashboards and views.

      "body": "Problem You notice delays between the time your AWS integration makes an API request and New Relic Infrastructure returns the metric data. Solution Depending on the Amazon AWS integration, New Relic Infrastructure may experience explicit delays or implicit delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. For more on this cause, see Cause. Normally, the delays do not sum up. With an explicit delay, New Relic expects the metric data to be at the delay point in time. For example, if New Relic uses an explicit delay of five minutes, at 9:00 the freshest data point should be the one for 8:55. However, delays may vary by customer and account. If you experience unusual delays in your metric data: Check whether your Infrastructure integration has explicit delays or implicit delays with API requests for metric data. CloudWatch users: Take a screenshot of the metric data in your CloudWatch console, and attach it when you request support at support.newrelic.com. Using your CloudWatch console's screenshot, New Relic Support will troubleshoot if the delay occurs in New Relic Infrastructure or directly in AWS. Cause Depending on the Amazon AWS integration, New Relic Infrastructure may experience explicit delays or implicit delays in the timing between the API request and the metric data returned. Metric data delays Comments Explicit delays (specifically set) Explicit delays are the ones that New Relic sets in the code to get more reliable data. In some cases, the API request to AWS may return one value, but a request for the same metric a minute later returns a different value. To reduce the possibility of this occurring, New Relic sets explicit delays. For example: If New Relic uses an explicit delay of five minutes, an API call at 9:00 requests metrics from 8:50 to 8:55. If New Relic does not use an explicit delay of five minutes, an API call at 9:00 requests metrics from 8:55 to 9:00. Explicit delays may come from these Infrastructure Amazon integrations: ALB: 5 minutes ELB: 5 minutes CloudFront: 1 minute RDS: 5 minutes SNS: 10 minutes Implicit delays (expected but not specifically set) Implicit delays are patterns that New Relic has experienced with integrations.

      "body": "New Relic currently provides independent integrations with AWS to collect performance metrics and metadata for more than 50 AWS services. With the new AWS Metric Streams integration, you only need a single service, AWS CloudWatch, to gather all AWS metrics and custom namespaces and send them to New Relic. Why does this matter? Our current system, which relies on individual integrations, runs on a polling fleet and calls multiple AWS APIs at regular intervals to retrieve the metrics and metadata. Using AWS CloudWatch significantly improves how metrics are gathered, overcoming some of the limitations of using the individual integrations. API mode Stream mode It requires an integration with each AWS service to collect the metrics. All CloudWatch metrics from all AWS services and custom namespaces are available in New Relic at once, without needing a specific integration to be built or updated. There are two exceptions: percentiles and a small number of metrics that are made available to CloudWatch with more than 2 hours delay, and therefore not included in the stream. It adds an additional delay to metrics being available in New Relic for alerting and dashboarding. The fastest polling interval we offer today is 5 minutes. Latency is significantly improved, since metrics are streamed in less than two minutes since they are made available in AWS CouldWatch. It may lead to AWS API throttling for large AWS environments. AWS API throttling is eliminated. Cost considerations Consider the following when evaluating the cost of the AWS CloudWatch metric streams integration with New Relic: AWS CloudWatch metric updates. See Metric Streams. AWS Kinesis Firehose ingest. AWS Kinesis Firehose data transfer. Optionally, custom tags and CloudWatch metrics enrichment with resource metadata is based on the AWS Config service. Set up a Metric Stream to send CloudWatch metrics to New Relic To stream CloudWatch metrics to New Relic you need to create Kinesis Data Firehose and point it to New Relic and then create a CloudWatch Metric Stream that sends metrics to that Firehose. How to map New Relic and AWS accounts and regions If you manage multiple AWS accounts, then each account needs to be connected to New Relic. If you manage multiple regions within those accounts, then each region needs to be configured with a different Kinesis Data Firehose pointing to New Relic. You will typically map one or many AWS accounts to a single New Relic account. Guided setup using CloudFormation First, you need to link each of your AWS accounts with your New Relic account. To do so: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. You may automate this step with NerdGraph. Next, set up the metric stream using the CloudFormation template we provide in the last step of our UI. This template is provided as a base to setup the integration on a single region, and can be customized and extended based on your requirements. Manual setup using AWS Console, API, or calls Create a Kinesis Data Firehose Delivery Stream and configure the following destination parameters: Source: Direct PUT or other sources Data transformation: Disabled Record format conversion: Disabled Destination: New Relic Ensure the following settings are defined: New Relic configuration (Destination Settings) HTTP endpoint URL - US Datacenter: https://aws-api.newrelic.com/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 HTTP endpoint URL - EU Datacenter: https://aws-api.eu01.nr-data.net/cloudwatch-metrics/v1 API key: Enter your license key Content encoding: GZIP Retry duration: 60 S3 backup mode: Failed data only S3 bucket: select a bucket or create a new one to store metrics that failed to be sent. New Relic buffer conditions Buffer size: 1 MB Buffer interval: 60 (seconds) Permissions IAM role: Create or update IAM role Create the metric stream. Go to CloudWatch service in your AWS console and select the Streams option under the Metrics menu. Click on Create metric stream. Determine the right configuration based on your use cases: Use inclusion and exclusion filters to select which services should push metrics to New Relic. Select your Kinesis Data Firehose. Define a meaningful name for the stream (for example, newrelic-metric-stream). Change default output format to Open Telemetry 0.7 (JSON is not supported) Confirm the creation of the metric stream. Alternatively, you can find instructions on the AWS documentation in order to create the CloudWatch metric stream using a CloudFormation template, API, or the CLI. Add the new AWS account in the Metric streams mode in the New Relic UI. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, click on Add an AWS account, then on Use metric streams, and follow the steps. Tip The following are the minimal permissions that should be granted on the AWS role configured in New Relic so that CloudWatch metrics can be enriched with additional service metadata and custom tags when applicable: config:BatchGetResourceConfig config:ListDiscoveredResources tag:GetResources Copy The New Relic UI currently recommends the ReadOnlyAccess policy over these individual items so that New Relic has proper permissions to collect service data that's not available in AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams. Validate your data is received correctly To confirm you are receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow the steps below: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS, and search for the Stream accounts. You can check the following: Account status dashboard. Useful to confirm that metric data is being received (errors, number of namespaces/metrics ingested, etc.) Explore your data. Use the Data Explorer to find a specific set of metrics, access all dimensions available for a given metric and more. Tip AWS CloudWatch metrics for global services such as AWS S3 or AWS Billing are only availble in the us-east-1 region. Make sure there's an active CloudWatch metric stream configured in that region. Metrics naming convention Metrics received from AWS CloudWatch are stored in New Relic as dimensional metrics following this convention: Metrics are prefixed by the AWS namespace, all lowercase, where / is replaced with . : AWS/EC2 -> aws.ec2 AWS/ApplicationELB -> aws.applicationelb The original AWS metric name with its original case: aws.ec2.CPUUtilization aws.s3.5xxErrors aws.sns.NumberOfMessagesPublished If the resource the metric belongs to has a specific namespace prefix, it is used. If the resource the metric belongs to doesn't have a specific namespace prefix, metrics use the aws. prefix. aws.Region aws.s3.BucketName Current namespaces supported by AWS can be found in the CloudWatch documentation website. Query Experience, metric storage and mapping Metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch are stored as dimensional metrics of type summary and can be queried using NRQL. We have mapped metrics from the current cloud integrations to the new mappings that will come from AWS Metric Streams. You can continue to use the current metric naming, and queries will continue to work and pick data from AWS Metric Streams and the current cloud integrations. Check our documentation on how current cloud integrations metrics map to the new metric naming. All metrics coming from the metric stream will have these attributes: aws.MetricStreamArn collector.name = ‘cloudwatch-metric-streams’. AWS namespaces' entities in the New Relic Explorer We generate New Relic entities for most used AWS namespaces and will continue adding support for more namespaces. When we generate New Relic entities for a namespace you can expect to: Browse those entities in the New Relic Explorer. Access an out-of-the-box entity dashboard for those entities. Get metrics and entities from that namespace decorated with AWS tags. Collecting AWS tags requires that you have given New Relic the tag:GetResources permission which is part of the setup process in the UI. AWS tags show in metrics as tag.AWSTagName; for example, if you have set a Team AWS tag on the resource, it will show as tag.Team. Leverage all the built-in features that are part of the Explorer. Important Lookout view in Entity Explorer is not compatible with entities created from the AWS Metric Streams integration at this time. Set alert conditions You can create NRQL alert conditions on metrics from a metric stream. Make sure your filter limits data to metrics from the CloudWatch metric stream only. To do that, construct your queries like this: SELECT sum(aws.s3.5xxErrors) FROM Metric WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' FACET aws.accountId, aws.s3.BucketName Copy Then, to make sure that alerts processes the data correctly, configure the advanced signal settings. These settings are needed because AWS CloudWatch receives metrics from services with a certain delay (for example, Amazon guarantees that 90% of EC2 metrics are available in CloudWatch within 7 minutes of them being generated). Moreover, streaming metrics from AWS to New Relic adds up to 1 minute additional delay, mostly due to buffering data in the Firehose. To configure the signal settings, under Condition Settings, click on Advanced Signal Settings and enter the following values: Aggregation window. We recommend setting it to 1 minute. If you are having issues with flapping alerts or alerts not triggering, consider increasing it to 2 minutes. Offset evaluation by. Depending on the service, CloudWatch may send metrics with a certain delay. The value is set in windows. With a 1-minute aggregation window, setting the offset to 8 ensures the majority of the metrics are evaluated correctly. You may be able to use a lower offset if the delay introduced by AWS and Firehose is less. Fill data gaps with. Leave this void, or use Last known value if gaps in the data coming from AWS lead to false positives or negatives. See our documentation on how to create NRQL alerts for more details. Tags collection New Relic provides enhanced dimensions from metrics coming from AWS CloudWatch metric streams. Resource and custom tags are automatically pulled from most services and are used to decorate metrics with additional dimensions. Use the data explorer to see which tags are available on each AWS metric. The following query shows an example of tags being collected and queried as dimensions in metrics: SELECT average(`aws.rds.CPUUtilization`) FROM Metric FACET `tags.mycustomtag` SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Note that not all metrics have their custom tags as dimensions. Currently, only metrics linked to entities in the New Relic Explorer have their custom tags associated. The AWS CloudWatch metric stream doesn't include tags as part of the stream message, hence, additional processing is required on the New Relic side. Metadata collection Like with custom tags, New Relic also pulls metadata information from relevant AWS services in order to decorate AWS CloudWatch metrics with enriched metadata collected from AWS Services APIs. This metadata is accessible in New Relic as additional dimensions on the metrics provided by AWS CloudWatch. This is an optional capability that's complementary to the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. The solution relies on AWS Config, which might incur in additional costs in your AWS account. AWS Config provides granular controls to determine which services and resources are recorded. New Relic will only ingest metadata from the available resources in your AWS account. The following services / namespaces are supported: EC2 Lambda RDS ALB/NLB S3 API Gateway (excluding API v1) ELB EBS DynamoDB ECS Curated dashboards A set of dashboards for the most popular AWS Services are available in New Relic Instant Observaiblity. How to import dashboards Follow these steps in order to browse and import dashboards: Click Instant Observability from the top bar in New Relic One. Search for any AWS service name, such as AWS SQS, AWS RDS, AWS ELB, or AWS EC2. Access the AWS service tile. Click Install this quickstarts and select your account. Click Done to confirm that AWS metric stream is already configured. Browse and adapt the dashboard according to your needs. Have an interesting dashboard to share with the community? See contribution guidelines in the Instant Observability Github repository. Manage your data New Relic provides a set of tools to keep track of the data being ingested in your account. Go to Manage your data in the settings menu to see all details. Metrics ingested from AWS Metric Streams integrations are considered in the Metric bucket. If you need a more granular view of the data you can use the bytecountestimate() function on Metric in order to estimate the data being ingested. For example, the following query represents data ingested from all metrics processed via AWS Metric Streams integration in the last 30 days (in bytes): FROM Metric SELECT bytecountestimate() where collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams' since 30 day ago Copy We recommend the following actions to control the data being ingested: Make sure metric streams are enabled only on the AWS accounts and regions you want to monitor with New Relic. Use the inclusion and exclusion filters in the CloudWatch Metric Stream in order to select which services / namespaces are being collected. Consider using drop data rules to discard metrics based on custom filters (for example, drop metrics by namespace and tag, tag value, or any other valid NRQL criteria). Important Metrics sent via AWS Metric Streams count against your Metric API limits for the New Relic account where data will be ingested. Migrating from AWS API polling integrations When metrics are sent via Metric Streams to New Relic, if the same metrics are being retrieved using the current poll-based integrations, those metrics will be duplicated. For example, alerts and dashboards that use sum or count will return twice the actual number. This includes alerts and dashboards that use metrics that have a .Sum suffix. We recommend sending the data to a non-production New Relic account where you can safely do tests. If that is not an option, then AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream filters are available to include or exclude certain namespaces that can cause trouble. Alternatively, you can use filtering on queries to distinguish between metrics that come from Metric Streams and those that come through polling. All metrics coming from Metric Streams are tagged with collector.name='cloudwatch-metric-streams'. Migration steps On a typical deployment, migrating from API polling to metric stream involves the following steps (we recommend trying this on a dev / staging environment first): Go through the AWS UI in New Relic (or use NerdGraph APIs) to link your AWS account with New Relic. This is currently needed even if your AWS account is already linked with polling integrations. Make sure you complete the last step in the onboarding, which involves enabling AWS CloudWatch metric stream and the AWS Kinesis Data Firehose to push metrics to New Relic. Complete this step for any additional AWS region you want to monitor, since AWS CloudWatch requires one stream per region. Ensure metrics are received from all connected regions and namespaces. This may take several minutes. Disable all unnecessary polling integrations in the previous AWS provider account. The following integrations still need to be enabled since they aren't fully replaced by metric streams: AWS Billing, AWS CloudTrail, AWS Health, AWS Trusted Advisor. Query, dashboard, alert and inventory considerations AWS Metric Streams integration uses the Metric API to push metrics in the dimensional metric format. Poll-based integrations push metrics based on events (for example, ComputeSample event), and will be migrated to dimensional metrics in the future. To assist in this transition, New Relic provides a mechanism (known as shimming) that transparently lets you write queries in any format. Then these queries are processed as expected based on the source that's available (metrics or events). This mechanism works both ways, from events to metrics, and viceversa. Please consider the following when migrating from poll-based integrations: Dashboards: Custom dashboards that use poll-based AWS integration events will still work as expected. Alerts: Alert conditions that use poll-based AWS events will still work. We recommend adapting those to the dimensional metric format (using NRQL as source). Entities: New Relic Explorer might show duplicated entities for up to 24 hours. Inventory: the Inventory page is not supported with AWS CloudWatch metric streams (inventory telemetry is not included in the stream). Integrations not fully replaced by metric streams The AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration only collects CloudWatch metrics, resource metadata and custom tags. The following API polling integrations still need to be enabled to get complete visibility from AWS: AWS Billing AWS CloudTrail AWS Health AWS Trusted Advisor AWS VPC Infrastructure Agent metrics and EC2 metadata decoration As with the EC2 API polling integration, when the infrastructure agent is installed on a host and the EC2 namespace is active via AWS CloudWatch metric stream integration, then all the infrastructure agent events and metrics are decorated with additional metadata. The following attributes will decorate infrastructure samples (some might not be applicable on all environments): awsAvailabilityZone, ec2InstanceId, ec2PublicDnsName, ec2State, ec2EbsOptimized, ec2PublicIpAddress, ec2PrivateIpAddress, ec2VpcId, ec2AmiId, ec2PrivateDnsName, ec2KeyName, ec2SubnetId, ec2InstanceType, ec2Hypervisor, ec2Architecture, ec2RootDeviceType, ec2RootDeviceName, ec2VirtualizationType, ec2PlacementGroupName, ec2PlacementGroupTenancy.",

      "body": "The New Relic Lambda monitoring stack There are several important parts to Lambda monitoring: Your function The New Relic agent or SDK The New Relic Lambda Extension New Relic's backend The New Relic One Lambda UI Your function Your function is the code you want to understand. You want to know when it's encountering errors, why it's slow, or how often it gets invoked. New Relic agent or SDK This is a library that New Relic provides for the language that your function is written in. Its job is to do the actual monitoring of your code. It measures the duration of your function invocations, notes errors that occur, records details about the source events, and your functions responses. To do this, it needs to wrap around your Lambda invocation handler function. With a bit more work on your part, you can break your invocation into interesting segments, and tie together the interaction of your function with other functions and services, providing a holistic view of your serverless application. New Relic Lambda Extension This sidecar process runs inside the Lambda execution environment, alongside your code. It enhances the telemetry that the agent collects, and sends it to New Relic's back end in batches. It can also send your function's logs to New Relic. The extension is a small application that integrates tightly with the AWS Lambda lifecycle, and works to minimize both the time it takes your telemetry to arrive at New Relic, and the impact that instrumentation has on your function's latency and throughput. See more about our Lambda extension. New Relic's backend The New Relic service receives your telemetry, processes it into AwsLambdaInvocation, AwsLambdaInvocationError, Span, and custom events, and stores all that in our telemetry database: NRDB. Lambda UI in New Relic One Lambda functions aren't quite like traditional services, so the experience of managing them is a little different from the classic APM experience. Inside New Relic One, Lambda functions have a custom UI, which quickly surfaces the most important information about your function, and integrates closely with our logging and distributed tracing features. Backed by NRDB and NRQL, you can also write custom dashboards and alerts for your functions. The legacy CloudWatch path Older integrations send telemetry in a slightly different way. Instead of passing telemetry off to the extension, the agent writes it out to CloudWatch as a log line. By adding a log subscription filter to pipe your function logs into the aws-log-ingestion Lambda function, we can recover that Cloudwatch log line, and forward it on to New Relic, along with some other platform telemetry. In the past, we've seen that this approach has some considerable drawbacks. The AWS CloudWatch service can generate a lot of data. If you're on the free tier, you may hit your data limit pretty quickly. If you're paying for data, you may find this service making up the largest share of the data you're sending to New Relic.",

Attribute name Definition Data types category A New Relic category used to organize events in the UI. For example: automation, notification, and service. InfrastructureEvent changeType A simple classification of the type of change made to the entity: added, modified, or removed. InfrastructureEvent changedPath The fully specified name of the item that changed. This is constructed by taking the source and adding one or more additional path elements that uniquely identify the item that changed. InfrastructureEvent deltaId Delta refers to a recorded change in the system. The deltaId is a number used by New Relic to organize incoming inventory change data. InfrastructureEvent eventId The unique ID of the event, generated by New Relic. InfrastructureEvent format The type of infrastructure event. Each format type includes attributes that may be used to render the event in the UI. InfrastructureEvent newStatus The new agent status: disconnected or connected. InfrastructureEvent newValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the new value of the inventory that was changed. This will have no value if no change has been made. The value will display approximately 4K bytes of data. InfrastructureEvent oldValue If a change is made to the entity, this attribute contains the old value of the inventory that was changed. This will be blank if no change has been made. InfrastructureEvent provider For integrations that use generic event types (like the DatastoreSample event), the provider value specifies the source of the data (the service, or a sub-category of data from that service). Some Insights events are generic and are used by several integrations. For example, the DatastoreSample event is used by several integrations, including the AWS DynamoDB integration and the AWS RDS integration. In these cases, the provider attribute value represents the source of that attribute. This will usually be the service that data comes from or, for integrations that use several provider values, a certain sub-category of data from that service. When a provider value is present for a generic event, that event will have additional integration-specific attributes attached to it. Here’s an example of an Insights NRQL query that returns the attributes present for a DatastoreSample event reported by the AWS RDS integration: SELECT * from DatastoreSample where provider = 'RdsDbCluster' InfrastructureEvent source The fully specified origin of this inventory item. This is typically in the form category/plugin, where plugin is the generic word used for the tool that gathered this data. InfrastructureEvent summary A summary of the change that happened. Uses a human-friendly string, such as Agent disconnected. InfrastructureEvent violationUpdateType The type of change to the violation: For example: open or closed.

Recommended AWS Lambda language runtimes NodeJS: nodejs12.x, nodejs14.x Python: python3.7, python3.8, python3.9 Go: provided, provided.al2 Java: java8.al2, java11 .NET Core: dotnetcore3.1 AWS has older runtimes for these languages as well, but AWS has not chosen to support the latest Lambda APIs with those older runtimes. Integration for older runtimes requires a different strategy, but is possible. Python and NodeJS are by far the most popular languages in the Lambda ecosystem. The New Relic Lambda Layers for Node and Python include the very latest New Relic Agent version, and provide rich instrumentation with minimal configuration, right out of the box. Similarly, Go uses the New Relic Go Agent. We recommend building self-hosting Go lambda functions, because the latest AWS Lambda APIs are not supported in the AWS go1.x runtime. Fortunately, this is well supported by the AWS Lambda SDK for Go. New Relic recommends keeping the agent module up to date. Support is limited for agent versions older than 3.9.0. To minimize performance impact, we've taken a different approach with Java and .NET Core. New Relic provides OpenTelemetry SDKs for these runtimes. This approach requires a bit more code to integrate. For complete Lambda instrumentation, some of our agents included in our Lambda layers depend on a language-specific AWS SDK. If an AWS SDK is not used, Lambda data will appear as external service calls in the UI, with minimal detail. In other words, we rely on the AWS SDK to facilitate instrumentation of your function. For the following services, only the \"target\" (Lambda function name, SNS topic ARN, DynamoDB table name, etc.) is reported: Autoscaling, Athena, Batch, Cloud9, CodeBuild, DynamoDB, Greengrass, IoT, Kinesis (Streams, Firehose, Analytics, Video), Lambda, Lex, Machine Learning, MQ, Redshift, Rekognition, S3, SES, SimpleDB, SNS, SQS, Storage Gateway, and STS. About AWS costs Enabling serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda may result in Amazon Web Services charges. Our newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda function, which reports your Lambda data to us, is considered a Third Party Service: AWS charges resulting from your use of it are your responsibility. If you use the Lambda Extension, you can avoid the CloudWatch Logs ingest charge for the telemetry gathered by New Relic.",

      "body": "Problem You’re attempting to enable serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda and are having an issue or error. Solution There are two common problems related to not completing all of the enablement procedures: Not seeing data on CloudWatch metrics UI page. This means the AWS integration step wasn't completed. Not seeing data on Troubleshooting category UI pages. If you aren't seeing data on the Distributed tracing, Errors, and Invocations UI tabs, this means the APM agent instrumentation step wasn't completed. Besides these basic enablement problems, there are some additional problems that may cause an issue: CloudWatch error \"HTTP error 401: unauthorized.\" This is due to an incorrect API Key. The --nr-api-keyargument in the Configure AWS enable step takes your user key, which is different from the REST API key. Custom metrics are missing. Lambda monitoring is not compatible with our custom metrics. Use custom attributes to add metadata. Invocations missing. To see invocation breakdown details, distributed tracing must be enabled as part of the Lambda instrumentation step. Distributed tracing is required so that span details can be displayed in the invocation details pane. You've completed the installation, integration, and instrumentation steps correctly, and your function is sending logs to CloudWatch but you're not seeing traces for specific dependencies (or any traces) in the UI. This may result from the order of layer merging (if you're using our Lambda layers) or from the order of import (if you're instrumenting manually): If you're instrumenting with layers: make sure in your function configuration that the New Relic layer is merged before other layers (though if your function uses webpack, the New Relic layer should be merged after the webpack layer). If you're instrumenting a Node function manually, make sure that your function imports newrelic and @newrelic/aws-sdk before it imports any dependencies you expect to monitor. If none of these solutions help you, contact our support team. The following information will help you when you talk to support technicians: Has the Lambda function appeared in the UI before? If so, what is the name of the function? If some data for the Lambda function is appearing in the UI, what specific data is appearing? What APM language agent are you using to instrument the function? Recommended: Attach your CloudWatch logs to the ticket To provide our support team with logging information when opening a ticket: Invoke the function in AWS Lambda. Click on the logs link after your function runs. This will take you to the CloudWatch logs in AWS. On the left-hand sidebar in AWS, under Logs, click on Insights. Select your function and also the newrelic-log-ingestion stream. Apply an appropriate Time Filter, and a log entry limit (the default of 20 may not be enough). Under Actions select Copy query results (ASCII). Paste the copied text into a new text file, then save and upload the text file to the ticket. Important The NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING payload contains all the information the agent attempts to send up, including metrics, events, some AWS account metadata, invocations and errors data. Note that some of that data (for example, our legacy metrics) will not make it to our UI because our ingest pipeline does not consume them.",

New Relic agent or SDK This is a library that New Relic provides for the language that your function is written in. Its job is to do the actual monitoring of your code. It measures the duration of your function invocations, notes errors that occur, records details about the source events, and your functions responses. To do this, it needs to wrap around your Lambda invocation handler function.

New Relic Lambda Extension This sidecar process runs inside the Lambda execution environment, alongside your code. It enhances the telemetry that the agent collects, and sends it to New Relic's back end in batches. It can also send your function's logs to New Relic.

Instead of passing telemetry off to the extension, the agent writes it out to CloudWatch as a log line. By adding a log subscription filter to pipe your function logs into the aws-log-ingestion Lambda function, we can recover that Cloudwatch log line, and forward it on to New Relic, along with some other platform telemetry. In the past, we've seen that this approach has some considerable drawbacks. The AWS CloudWatch service can generate a lot of data.

Recommended AWS Lambda language runtimes NodeJS: nodejs12.x, nodejs14.x Python: python3.7, python3.8, python3.9 Go: provided, provided.al2 Java: java8.al2, java11 .NET Core: dotnetcore3.1 AWS has older runtimes for these languages as well, but AWS has not chosen to support the latest Lambda APIs with those older runtimes. Integration for older runtimes requires a different strategy, but is possible. Python and NodeJS are by far the most popular languages in the Lambda ecosystem. The New Relic Lambda Layers for Node and Python include the very latest New Relic Agent version, and provide rich instrumentation with minimal configuration, right out of the box. Similarly, Go uses the New Relic Go Agent. We recommend building self-hosting Go lambda functions, because the latest AWS Lambda APIs are not supported in the AWS go1.x runtime. Fortunately, this is well supported by the AWS Lambda SDK for Go. New Relic recommends keeping the agent module up to date. Support is limited for agent versions older than 3.9.0. To minimize performance impact, we've taken a different approach with Java and .NET Core. New Relic provides OpenTelemetry SDKs for these runtimes. This approach requires a bit more code to integrate. For complete Lambda instrumentation, some of our agents included in our Lambda layers depend on a language-specific AWS SDK. If an AWS SDK is not used, Lambda data will appear as external service calls in the UI, with minimal detail. In other words, we rely on the AWS SDK to facilitate instrumentation of your function. For the following services, only the \"target\" (Lambda function name, SNS topic ARN, DynamoDB table name, etc.) is reported: Autoscaling, Athena, Batch, Cloud9, CodeBuild, DynamoDB, Greengrass, IoT, Kinesis (Streams, Firehose, Analytics, Video), Lambda, Lex, Machine Learning, MQ, Redshift, Rekognition, S3, SES, SimpleDB, SNS, SQS, Storage Gateway, and STS. About AWS costs Enabling serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda may result in Amazon Web Services charges. Our newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda function, which reports your Lambda data to us, is considered a Third Party Service: AWS charges resulting from your use of it are your responsibility. If you use the Lambda Extension, you can avoid the CloudWatch Logs ingest charge for the telemetry gathered by New Relic.",

Backed by NRDB and NRQL, you can also write custom dashboards and alerts for your functions. The legacy CloudWatch path Older integrations send telemetry in a slightly different way. Instead of passing telemetry off to the extension, the agent writes it out to CloudWatch as a log line. By adding a log subscription filter to pipe your function logs into the aws-log-ingestion Lambda function, we can recover that Cloudwatch log line, and forward it on to New Relic, along with some other platform telemetry. In the past, we've seen that this approach has some considerable drawbacks. The AWS CloudWatch service can generate a lot of data.

This Lambda monitoring feature is not the same as the Lambda monitoring integration, which only uses CloudWatch data. Serverless Lambda monitoring is more extensive and uses both CloudWatch data and code-level instrumentation to deliver more in-depth monitoring. Why it matters Do you need to rapidly instrument monitoring and observability to your serverless functions without resorting to code changes? Our Lambda layer provides unified visibility into the most detailed behaviors of your Lambda functions so you can understand what's going on in your serverless applications. Use all this information to troubleshoot your systems and optimize your functions so they can function faster and deliver with confidence on serverless architectures. Spend less time instrumenting, and more time building. Lambda monitoring gives you: Every invocation of your Lambda functions, including performance data like detailed duration, cold starts, exceptions, and tracebacks. AWS Lambda event source information, which provides context and attributes about events that triggered each AWS Lambda invocation, such as API Gateway, ALB SNS, SQS, DynamoDB, and more. Visibility into your entire ecosystem with distributed tracing: see the path of requests that led to your Lambda, and see Lambda spans in your other distributed traces. Logs in context, which provides full invocation and function level logs right along side the metrics, attributes, and trace data. Inventoried tags and metadata. We retrieve information from your AWS entities, giving you the ability to filter and facet down to the team, or specific metadata attributes on the function configuration or invocation itself. Easy ability to query your data with an automatic facet builder, which instantly facets your dashboards and charts by attribute or function to explore custom data, without having to write queries. Lambda data is displayed in its own dedicated UI in New Relic One. Access and requirements See Compatibility and requirements of AWS Lambda monitoring. Next steps: Enable and use Lambda monitoring To get started using our Lambda monitoring, see the installation and enablement instructions.

Integration for older runtimes requires a different strategy, but is possible. Python and NodeJS are by far the most popular languages in the Lambda ecosystem. The New Relic Lambda Layers for Node and Python include the very latest New Relic Agent version, and provide rich instrumentation with minimal configuration, right out of the box. Similarly, Go uses the New Relic Go Agent. We recommend building self-hosting Go lambda functions, because the latest AWS Lambda APIs are not supported in the AWS go1.x runtime. Fortunately, this is well supported by the AWS Lambda SDK for Go. New Relic recommends keeping the agent module up to date. Support is limited for agent versions older than 3.9.0. To minimize performance impact, we've taken a different approach with Java and .NET Core. New Relic provides OpenTelemetry SDKs for these runtimes. This approach requires a bit more code to integrate. For complete Lambda instrumentation, some of our agents included in our Lambda layers depend on a language-specific AWS SDK. If an AWS SDK is not used, Lambda data will appear as external service calls in the UI, with minimal detail. In other words, we rely on the AWS SDK to facilitate instrumentation of your function. For the following services, only the \"target\" (Lambda function name, SNS topic ARN, DynamoDB table name, etc.) is reported: Autoscaling, Athena, Batch, Cloud9, CodeBuild, DynamoDB, Greengrass, IoT, Kinesis (Streams, Firehose, Analytics, Video), Lambda, Lex, Machine Learning, MQ, Redshift, Rekognition, S3, SES, SimpleDB, SNS, SQS, Storage Gateway, and STS. About AWS costs Enabling serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda may result in Amazon Web Services charges. Our newrelic-log-ingestion Lambda function, which reports your Lambda data to us, is considered a Third Party Service: AWS charges resulting from your use of it are your responsibility.

Charts include: invocation counts, duration, throttles, and error counts. Distributed tracing The Distributed tracing page shows distributed traces that include the monitored Lambda function. For details about this feature, see Distributed tracing. Errors The Errors page displays errors (AwsLambdaInvocationError events). You can filter by error rate, error percentage, or error class. You can drill down into errors and see attributes and, if available, stack traces. Invocations The Invocations page lets you filter your invocations by attribute, and view duration, throughput, external calls, and invocation breakdowns. About invocation breakdowns: Some invocations will generate a breakdown if distributed tracing is enabled during instrumentation. Breakdowns are sampled; approximately 10% of invocations generate a breakdown. This sampling rate may be higher, depending on upstream sampling decisions. Logs The Logs page displays recent log messages from your Lambda function. For details about this feature, see Logs.

      "body": "Problem You’re attempting to enable serverless monitoring for AWS Lambda and are having an issue or error. Solution There are two common problems related to not completing all of the enablement procedures: Not seeing data on CloudWatch metrics UI page. This means the AWS integration step wasn't completed. Not seeing data on Troubleshooting category UI pages. If you aren't seeing data on the Distributed tracing, Errors, and Invocations UI tabs, this means the APM agent instrumentation step wasn't completed. Besides these basic enablement problems, there are some additional problems that may cause an issue: CloudWatch error \"HTTP error 401: unauthorized.\" This is due to an incorrect API Key. The --nr-api-keyargument in the Configure AWS enable step takes your user key, which is different from the REST API key. Custom metrics are missing. Lambda monitoring is not compatible with our custom metrics. Use custom attributes to add metadata. Invocations missing. To see invocation breakdown details, distributed tracing must be enabled as part of the Lambda instrumentation step. Distributed tracing is required so that span details can be displayed in the invocation details pane. You've completed the installation, integration, and instrumentation steps correctly, and your function is sending logs to CloudWatch but you're not seeing traces for specific dependencies (or any traces) in the UI. This may result from the order of layer merging (if you're using our Lambda layers) or from the order of import (if you're instrumenting manually): If you're instrumenting with layers: make sure in your function configuration that the New Relic layer is merged before other layers (though if your function uses webpack, the New Relic layer should be merged after the webpack layer). If you're instrumenting a Node function manually, make sure that your function imports newrelic and @newrelic/aws-sdk before it imports any dependencies you expect to monitor. If none of these solutions help you, contact our support team. The following information will help you when you talk to support technicians: Has the Lambda function appeared in the UI before? If so, what is the name of the function? If some data for the Lambda function is appearing in the UI, what specific data is appearing? What APM language agent are you using to instrument the function? Recommended: Attach your CloudWatch logs to the ticket To provide our support team with logging information when opening a ticket: Invoke the function in AWS Lambda. Click on the logs link after your function runs. This will take you to the CloudWatch logs in AWS. On the left-hand sidebar in AWS, under Logs, click on Insights. Select your function and also the newrelic-log-ingestion stream. Apply an appropriate Time Filter, and a log entry limit (the default of 20 may not be enough). Under Actions select Copy query results (ASCII). Paste the copied text into a new text file, then save and upload the text file to the ticket. Important The NR_LAMBDA_MONITORING payload contains all the information the agent attempts to send up, including metrics, events, some AWS account metadata, invocations and errors data. Note that some of that data (for example, our legacy metrics) will not make it to our UI because our ingest pipeline does not consume them.",
