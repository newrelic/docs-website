Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing New Relic for PHP applications. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Important As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP if that version is PHP 5.1, which is deprecated. If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only found a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. Important If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-nnnn.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install-daemon mode Important Requires PHP agent 9.2 or higher. To install the daemon without the agent, run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This may be useful if the daemon is running on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application (as may happen with agent install on containers). Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in APM, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters that might have been placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. Tip To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling (RedHat and CentOS) or Uninstalling (Ubuntu and Debian).

      "body": "You can install the PHP agent on a Docker container or other container to monitor one or more of your PHP applications. This is supported for containers that meet PHP agent requirements. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values. Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.

This is supported for containers that meet PHP agent requirements. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values. Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various languages, including PHP. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini _ .heroku [ INI | 16KB]. Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values. Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various languages, including PHP. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini _ .heroku [ INI | 16KB]. Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing New Relic for PHP applications. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Tip To use PHP or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Important As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP if that version is PHP 5.1, which is deprecated. If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only found a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. Important If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-nnnn.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install-daemon mode Important Requires PHP agent 9.2 or higher. To install the daemon without the agent, run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This may be useful if the daemon is running on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application (as may happen with agent install on containers). Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in APM, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters that might have been placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. Tip To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling (RedHat and CentOS) or Uninstalling (Ubuntu and Debian).

Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various languages, including PHP. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini _ .heroku [ INI | 16KB]. Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Depending on the language agent, available settings may include: Transaction tracing SQL recording and logging SQL query plans Error collection Thread profiling Distributed tracing Cross application tracing Centralization and security Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic UI. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change automatically applies to all New Relic APM agents, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings not available from the UI. Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly within the New Relic UI, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you utilize environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls. Also, server-side configuration is not supported. However, you can change the app name from the UI or from the C SDK configuration settings.

Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 5.5 or higher (except 5.6) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5.

For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 1.2, 1.3, and 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Silex 1.x and 2.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, 2.x, and 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 1.x, 2.x, 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8.

Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters.

For a more flexible method to create key/value pairs, use newrelic_add_custom_parameter. As of release 4.4, calling newrelic_set_user_attributes(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"); is equivalent to calling newrelic_add_custom_parameter(\"user\", \"a\"); newrelic_add_custom_parameter(\"account\", \"b\"); newrelic_add_custom_parameter(\"product\", \"c\"); All three parameters are required, but they may be empty strings. Parameters Parameter Description $user_value string Required (can be empty string). Specify a name or username to associate with this page view. This value is assigned to the user key. $account_value string Required (can be empty string). Specify the name of a user account to associate with this page view. This value is assigned to the account key. $product_value string Required (can be empty string). Specify the name of a product to associate with this page view. This value is assigned to the product key. Return values This function will return true if the attributes were added successfully.

This also includes a summary of the PHP agent properties that have been deprecated with the release of New Relic agent attributes. Properties Use the following destination properties to open or close the destination to any attribute collection: newrelic.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or turns off all attributes in all destinations. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: False Turns on or turns off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data that gets sent to page views in Insights. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to browser monitoring regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for traced errors. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for transaction events. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or off all attributes for transaction traces. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless of how this property is set. newrelic.span_events.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or off all attributes for Span data. If newrelic.attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to spans regardless of how this property is set. Use the following attribute/destination specific .include or .exclude properties to add or remove specific attributes in specific destinations: newrelic.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic. newrelic.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic Browser in page views. newrelic.browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent to New Relic in page views. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.error_collector.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in traced errors. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction events. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in transaction traces. newrelic.span_events.attributes.include Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty If attributes are enabled for span events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent to New Relic in span events. newrelic.span_events.attributes.exclude Type: Comma-delimited list of strings Default: Empty All attribute keys in this list will not be sent to New Relic in span events. Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters.

Depending on the language agent, available settings may include: Transaction tracing SQL recording and logging SQL query plans Error collection Thread profiling Distributed tracing Cross application tracing Centralization and security Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic UI. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change automatically applies to all New Relic APM agents, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings not available from the UI. Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly within the New Relic UI, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you utilize environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls. Also, server-side configuration is not supported. However, you can change the app name from the UI or from the C SDK configuration settings. Go hierarchy Java hierarchy .NET hierarchy Node.js hierarchy PHP hierarchy (server-side configuration not supported) Python hierarchy Ruby hierarchy Enable server-side configuration Tip Owner, Admins, or Add-on Managers The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration.

After you enable server-side configuration, you can view and change the available settings through the UI. View or change server-side configuration settings Tip Owner, Admins, or Add-on Managers If you use server-side configuration, you must still include your license_key and app_name in the local config file. These settings are required for the agent to communicate with the New Relic collector. The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration.

View or change the available configuration settings for your agent. If you make changes, select Save server-side configuration. Once you set any of these options from the UI, they will override any conflicting options in the agent's configuration file.

      "body": "Our PHP agent has a number of settings to fine-tune the types and amounts of data reported. For most users, the default values produce the best possible mix of overhead and utility. However, you can change the settings for your specific needs. Important Always restart your web server after changing INI settings. Otherwise, they may not take effect immediately. Configuration order of precedence Here is a simple illustration of the order of precedence that the PHP agent follows for configuration. Server-side configuration is not applicable. The only values you can change in the UI for apps using the PHP agent are the app's alias and its Apdex-T value. With New Relic's PHP agent, API settings override per-directory configuration settings. Per-directory settings override the php.ini file settings. Server-side configuration is not applicable. Configuration file variables During installation, the newrelic-install script provides information about the configuration files it created or a list of files you need to edit. By default it will attempt to create a configuration file named newrelic.ini. In some cases, you may be instructed to add configuration options to your php.ini file. Only do this if necessary. Exactly which file you need to edit depends on how your particular version (or versions) of PHP were configured. The two most common configurations are: Use a single newrelic.ini file. This is usually the default if you have installed or compiled PHP yourself with no special options. Scan a given directory for all .ini files. If you are unsure which file to edit: From the command line, review the output of php -i. In a browser, review the output of a page containing the script: <?php phpinfo(); ?> Copy If the newrelic.ini file appears, use it. Variable scope Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined scope. The scope controls where the setting can be established or modified. The two scopes supported for New Relic settings are: SYSTEM: Values set globally in the global newrelic.ini file. PERDIR: Values set on a per-directory basis. Each can also be set at a more general level. Valid locations for each are: Can be set for: SYSTEM PERDIR Set in the global newrelic.ini file. Set on a per-directory basis. Important You cannot use ini_set() for New Relic settings. Variable type Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined type. The type specifies the syntax for the value you use. Variable type Formatting and contents String String values can contain any alphanumeric character and punctuation. The value is delimited by quotes. Boolean A logical true or false setting. Valid values are: For true or enabled: on, true, the number 1. For false or disabled: off, false, the number 0. Number Numeric values can only contain digits, plus a period to indicate floats. Unless otherwise stated, all numbers are integers, not floats. Duration A string value delimited by quotes that represent a time duration. Use character flags to delimit time components. If there are no flags, the time is in milliseconds. w\\ = weeks d\\ = days h\\ = hours m\\ = minutes s\\ = seconds ms\\ = milliseconds us\\ = microseconds Example durations: \"1w3d23h10m\"\\ = 1 week, 3 days, 23 hours, and 10 minutes \"5h30m\"\\ = 5 hours and 30 minutes \"500\"\\ = 500 milliseconds General configuration settings These settings are available in the newrelic.ini file. newrelic.appname (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"PHP Application\" This config option sets the application name that data is reported under in APM. We highly recommends that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in New Relic, so set this carefully. For all application-naming options, including per-directory settings, see Name your PHP application. The setting's value is a semicolon-separated list of up to three application names. The first name in the list is the primary application name. It must be unique for each account. The application name is used as a key into a cache. When using multiple names for an app, New Relic only uses the first name for caching. Therefore, each application name can only appear as the first element once. Caching example If you set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App2\" and later in the code set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App3\", the second one will appear not to work. It will report to App1 and App2 because of the caching. If you need overlapping application names, set the common application name in the second or third positions. For example: newrelic.appname=\"App2;App1\" and newrelic.appname=\"App3;App1\". This is useful, for example, when you want to track a superset of applications. newrelic.capture_params Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. To set this value programmatically, use the newrelic_capture_params() API function. If you pass sensitive information directly in the URL, keep this disabled. If set to true, this will enable the recording of parameters passed to a PHP script via the URL (everything after the ? in the URL) in transaction traces. These will appear under the Parameters dropdown when displaying transaction traces. newrelic.framework Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: (auto-detected) The New Relic PHP agent automatically detects the frameworks it supports, but problems may arise if you are using experimental new versions or if you have customized the framework. This setting disables automatic framework detection, instead telling the agent to attempt to name transactions according to the specified framework. Specifying \"no_framework\" will disable framework-related transaction naming entirely. Use any of the following values, as appropriate: \"cakephp\" \"codeigniter\" \"drupal\" (for Drupal 6 and 7) \"drupal8\" \"joomla\" \"kohana\" \"laravel\" \"magento\" \"magento2\" \"mediawiki\" \"silex\" \"symfony1\" \"symfony2\" (for Symfony 2 and 3) \"symfony4\" \"wordpress\" \"yii\" \"zend\" \"zend2\" (for Zend Framework 2 and 3) \"no_framework\" (to force no framework even if one was detected) If the framework auto-detection fails, this command will also fail. newrelic.ignored_params Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. Use the newrelic.ignored_params setting to specify a comma-separated list of parameter names to be excluded from the list of parameters sent to the New Relic servers. Enclose the string values with quote marks. If you enable parameter capturing with newrelic.capture_params, there may be parameters with sensitive user data you do not want to be captured by New Relic or visible in transaction traces. Use this to block the recording of this data. newrelic.license (REQUIRED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Notes: Introduced in agent version 3.0. Sets the New Relic license key to use. In a multi-tenant system this can be set on a per-directory basis. Tip When you upgrade from an old agent version to 3.0 or higher, the license will be removed from your daemon configuration file (with a comment explaining why) and stored in the file /etc/newrelic/upgrade_please.key. Copy the license out of that file and set it in your newrelic.ini file. Delete the upgrade_please.key file. newrelic.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the level of detail of messages sent to the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, include: error warning info verbose debug verbosedebug When reporting any agent issues to New Relic technical support, verbosedebug is the most useful setting. However, this can generate a lot of information very quickly, so avoid keeping the agent at verbosedebug level for longer than it takes to reproduce the problem you are experiencing. When reporting any agent issues to New Relic Technical Support, you may be asked to set this to a custom level, enabling debugging only for certain subsystems. Custom levels are beyond the scope of this document. newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 1 Notes: This used to be newrelic.transaction_tracer.top100. Sets the level of detail in a transaction trace: When set to 1, all server calls are traced. When set to 0, traces only include internally instrumented calls by New Relic and those defined by the user using newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom. The default level of 1 does have a performance impact. If you need to improve performance, try setting the detail level to 0. When not tracing all server calls, blocks of time in transaction traces will be labeled as uninstrumented time, and only certain functions (defined internally by the agent) are instrumented. Even when reporting all calls, there may be uninstrumented time in the traces. newrelic.high_security Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables high security for all applications. When high security is set to true, the following behaviors take effect: Data will not be sent to New Relic unless the newrelic-daemon is using a secure connection (HTTPS). If the PHP process spawns a newrelic-daemon, it will be configured to use HTTPS regardless of the value of newrelic.daemon.ssl. Raw query strings will never be gathered, regardless of the value of newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql. Request attributes will never be captured, regardless of the newrelic.attributes configuration settings. The newrelic_add_custom_parameter and newrelic_set_user_attributes API function will have no effect, and they will return false. The newrelic_record_custom_event API function will not submit any events to New Relic. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Caution If you change the newrelic.high_security setting, you must also change the security setting in the APM user interface. If the two settings do not match, then no data will be collected. For more information, see High security. newrelic.labels Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Adds tags. Example tags \"Server:One;Data Center:Primary\" Copy newrelic.process_host.display_name Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. Daemon .ini settings The values of these settings control the daemon startup. When the agent detects that the daemon needs to be started, it will convert these options into the appropriate command line options for the daemon. All of these settings mirror the settings in the newrelic.cfg file. They are repeated here to keep all of the .ini settings in one place. Each setting in newrelic.cfg has its counterpart here, with newrelic.daemon. as the prefix. For example, the ssl setting in newrelic.cfg is newrelic.daemon.ssl in an .ini file. Important If the file /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent ignores these settings, and the agent will not start the daemon automatically. For more information about ways to start the daemon and when to use an external configuration file, see PHP daemon startup modes. newrelic.daemon.app_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"5m\" or \"1h20m\" Default: \"10m\" Sets the elapsed time after which an application will be considered inactive. Inactive applications do not count against the maximum limit of 250 applications. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". A value of 0 will be interpreted as \"no timeout.\" This will result in new applications always counting towards the 250 application limit, as well as the daemon being unable to release a small amount of memory per application back to the operating system. Recommendation: Do not use this value unless New Relic Support requests it. Instead, for occasional background transactions, use a value of twice the interval. For example, for an hourly background job, set the timeout to 2 hours. newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon connecting an application. A value of 0 causes the agent to only make one attempt at connecting to the daemon. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". With this timeout set, the agent will not immediately drop a transaction when the daemon hasn't connected to the backend yet, but rather grant the daemon time to establish the connection. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 15s. Only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of connection problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. newrelic.daemon.auditlog Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" The setting specifies the name of an audit log, which will contain all of the data sent from the daemon to the New Relic servers, including the full URL, date, time, and the uncompressed, unencoded data for each request. This file cannot be the same file as the daemon log. Important This audit log can become very large, very quickly. Avoid using the newrelic.daemon.auditlog setting for extended periods of time. Its primary purpose is to allow system administrators to perform security reviews and to observe exactly what data transmits. newrelic.daemon.collector_host Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"collector.newrelic.com\" Sets the name and optional port of the collector host which the daemon will contact to verify your license key and send agent data. This is either just the name of the host or the name and port number in the form \"hostname:port\". Specifying a port number of 0 will use the default port, which is 80. Caution Do not change this value without guidance from New Relic Support. newrelic.daemon.dont_launch Scope: SYSTEM Type: Number Default: 0 If you prefer to have the daemon launched externally before the agent starts up, this value determines when the agent is allowed to start the daemon: 0: No restrictions are placed on daemon startup and the agent can start the daemon any time. 1: Non-command line (such as Apache or php-fpm) agents can start the daemon. 2: Only command line agents can start the daemon. 3: The agent will never start the daemon. Use this setting if you are configuring the daemon via newrelic.cfg and starting it outside of the agent. Important If /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent assumes the daemon is meant to be started by its startup script, not via the agent. This setting has no meaning to and does not appear in newrelic.cfg. newrelic.daemon.location Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/usr/bin/newrelic-daemon\" Sets the name of the daemon executable to launch. This variable identifies the full path to the daemon executable file. If the New Relic system was installed using the standard packages, the default location will be correct. If you have installed to a custom location using the tar distribution (and do not have permission to write to /usr/bin), then the daemon may reside at another location. This setting does not appear in the newrelic.cfg file as it is only relevant to PHP. Important On OpenSolaris, /usr is frequently a read-only file system. The default daemon location for OpenSolaris is /opt/newrelic/bin/newrelic-daemon. newrelic.daemon.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/newrelic-daemon.log\" Sets the name of the log file to record daemon specific log messages. This file must be writable by the daemon. The most common case is that the Apache user will end up starting the daemon when Apache itself starts up, thus you should ensure that the file is writable by whichever user runs the Apache process. Caution If the daemon log file is not writable, the daemon will not start automatically, which will prevent data from reporting. You can use write permissions to this file as a means of restricting who can start the daemon. newrelic.daemon.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the detail level for messages recorded to New Relic's daemon log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: error warning info debug The more verbose settings can generate a lot of information very quickly. When necessary, set debug for short periods of time to identify problems. newrelic.daemon.pidfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: (depends on OS) Sets the name of the file in which the daemon will record its process ID (pid). This file is used by the daemon startup and shutdown script to determine whether or not the daemon is already running. newrelic.daemon.address (alias for newrelic.daemon.port) Scope: SYSTEM Type: String or Number Default: \"@newrelic\" on Linux, \"/tmp/.newrelic.sock\" otherwise Tip From v9.2.0.247, the PHP agent supports a new setting, newrelic.daemon.address,which serves as an alias to newrelic.daemon.port. You can use either to specify the location of the New Relic PHP daemon. If both values are set, newrelic.daemon.address takes precedence. Sets the socket endpoint for agent to daemon communications. This can be specified in four ways. To use a specified file as a UNIX domain socket (UDS), provide an absolute path name as a string. This is the default on non-Linux systems. To use a standard TCP port, specify a number in the range 1 to 65534. To use an abstract socket, use the value @newrelic-daemon (available for agent version 5.2.0.141 or higher). This is the default on Linux systems. To connect to a daemon that is running on a different host (helpful for container environments), set this value to host:port, where host denotes either a host name or an IP, and port denotes a valid port number. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported. This is available for agent version 9.2.0.247 or higher. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. We recommend only using a private network connection between the agent and daemon (this only applies when the agent and daemon are running on different hosts). If you use port numbers, Unix systems require that ports in the range 1 to 1023 require the daemon be run as the super-user. In case the daemon uses a non-standard port, this variable also sets the port number the agent will use for communicating with the daemon. Important If you're using the newrelic.cfg startup mechanism for the daemon, this setting and the address setting in that file must match. newrelic.daemon.proxy Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the host and user credentials to use as an egress proxy. This is only used if your site requires a proxy in order to access the New Relic data collection servers. It can take any of the following forms, depending on the proxy setup: hostname hostname:port user@hostname user@hostname:port user:password@hostname user:password@hostname:port proxytype://user:password@hostname:port A proxy type of HTTP is assumed unless another proxytype is specified. In that case, proxytype can be one of http, socks4, socks4a, or socks5. newrelic.daemon.ssl Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true This setting is ignored on PHP agent versions 8.0 and higher, and HTTPS will always be used to communicate with New Relic. On versions of the PHP agent versions lower than 8.0, controls whether or not communication with New Relic collectors should use a secure HTTP connection. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a file containing CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this file will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA bundle. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path is also set, the certificates in this file will be searched first, followed by the certificates contained in the newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path directory. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a directory containing trusted CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this directory will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA path. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle is also set, it will be searched first followed by the certificates contained in newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.start_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon to start after a daemon launch was triggered. A value of 0 causes the agent to not wait. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\" and \"h\". The specified timeout value will be passed to the daemon via the --wait-for-port flag. This causes daemon startup to block until a socket is acquired or until the timeout is elapsed. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 2s to 5s. It is recommended to only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of daemon start problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. Transaction tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Set this to a comma-separated list of user defined functions or methods to instrument: \"myfunction,myclass::method,otherfunction\" Copy Internal PHP functions cannot have custom tracing. You can add to the list of custom functions with each PERDIR file, but you cannot remove a function or method that has already been added. If you want to programmatically add functions or methods to be instrumented, use the newrelic_add_custom_tracer() API function call. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables the transaction tracer. The tracer creates a detailed transaction trace for transactions that take more time than the threshold, as set by the newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold value. Only one transaction trace per application per harvest cycle is stored and it is always the slowest transaction during that cycle. Transaction traces are useful for diagnosing why a particular transaction was slow. Unless memory and performance are critical, they should almost never be disabled. Enabling this does have a very slight performance impact and does use more memory. For more information, see newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables requesting explain plans from MySQLi and PDO MySQL libraries for slow query calls. Explain plans will only be available when newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql is set to true and newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is not set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" Sets the threshold beyond which queries are considered \"slow\" and thus candidates for the Slow Queries page. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.internal_functions_enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables or disables support for tracing internal functions (that is, functions written in C and provided either via the PHP standard library or PECL extensions). When enabled, internal functions appear in transaction traces like functions written in PHP. Enabling this option may result in transactions being slower, especially when collecting many traces from PHP 5.x. Enabling this option is only recommended when specifically debugging performance issues where an internal function is suspected to be slow. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"obfuscated\" Sets how queries are recorded (if at all). When recording transaction traces internally, the full query for slow query calls is recorded. Sending this query to New Relic can have serious security implications, so by default, all database statements are obfuscated before being sent to New Relic. The obfuscation is not reversible, as it replaces strings and numbers in any query with question marks. The only things that survive intact are field names, not any of their values. If you are testing with data that is not sensitive and you need to see the raw queries in transaction traces, set this to \"raw\". If you do not want queries recorded at all, set this to \"off\". Important Always set this back to \"obfuscated\" or \"off\" in any production environment. newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable the Slow Queries feature. When enabled, it will: Record the top 10 slowest database queries per application per minute. Create a stack trace leading up to the query. If this variable is set to false or SQL recording is disabled, the New Relic agent does not gather any slow query data. newrelic.transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" This sets the threshold above which the agent will record the full PHP stack for transaction traces for which queries are being recorded. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" Stack traces can consume memory, so be careful of setting this value too low. This variable has no meaning if newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"apdex_f\" Use this variable to set the threshold beyond which transactions are eligible for being traced. Available values include: Use \"apdex_f\" to set the threshold to 4 times the application's apdex_t value. For more information, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. Use any other duration string to set a specific time threshold. Specify the duration as an absolute value and the unit of measurement. If none is specified, the unit defaults to millisecond. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.gather_input_queries Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable gathering of DQL input queries with Slow Queries and Transaction Traces. When enabled, these will appear along with slow queries and transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 0 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for web transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP web processes; it will not effect PHP CLI processes. To set a limit for CLI processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 100000 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for CLI transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP CLI processes; it will not effect PHP web processes. To set a limit for web processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web. Other tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control various tracer features. newrelic.cross_application_tracer.enabled Important A distributed tracing feature is available. Distributed tracing improves on cross application tracing and is recommended for monitoring activity in complex distributed systems. Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the cross application tracer. The cross application tracer inserts HTTP headers into outbound requests and the response in order to link together web transaction metrics and transaction traces between applications. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the PHP agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross-application tracing. Before enabling, read the transition guide to understand effects on New Relic features. Enable or disable distributed tracing. When the agent's transaction tracer and distributed tracing features are enabled, the agent will insert headers into outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic distributed tracing header that is attached to outbound requests, and to instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are attached to outbound requests. The New Relic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that do not support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over New Relic headers for distributed tracing. newrelic.span_events_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Span event reporting requires distributed tracing to be enabled. This option enables/disables the reporting of span events. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: \"\" Configures the Trace Observer used for Infinite Tracing. If empty, Infinite Tracing support will be disabled. This requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer Default: 443 Configures the TCP/IP port used to communicate with the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. This setting is ignored if newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host is empty. This setting will not usually need to be changed. newrelic.infinite_tracing.span_events.queue_size Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer (1000 or higher) Default: 100000 Sets the number of span events that can be queued for transmission to the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. The agent internally manages span events for Infinite Tracing in span batches. Those span batches can hold a maximum of 1000 spans. Therefore, the span events queue size cannot be lower than 1000, as otherwise not even a single span batch can be queued. If a queue size lower than 1000 is specified, the minimum size of 1000 is used. newrelic.error_collector.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the error collector. When enabled, the agent collects and reports PHP errors to the New Relic UI. The agent records only the single most severe error for each transaction, and up to 20 errors per harvest cycle. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. newrelic.error_collector.record_database_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When enabled, the agent collects errors returned by MySQL functions as if they were PHP errors. newrelic.error_collector.prioritize_api_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to assign the highest priority to errors identified through the newrelic_notice_error() API function. newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) A comma separated list of fully-qualified exception class names that the agent should ignore. When an unhandled exception occurs, the agent will perform the equivalent of $exception instanceof Class for each of the classes listed. If any of those checks returns true, the agent will not record an exception. Depending on the supported PHP release, these values are equivalent to disabling exception reporting: Supported PHP 5 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Exceptions Supported PHP 7 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Throwable newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer or a bitwise expression of PHP-defined error constants Default: 0 Sets the error levels for the PHP agent to ignore. The value for this setting uses similar syntax to PHP's error_reporting option. For example, to configure the PHP agent to ignore E_WARNING and E_ERROR level errors, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_WARNING | E_ERROR or newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = 3 To configure the PHP agent to ignore everything but E_WARNING, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_ALL & ~E_WARNING newrelic.framework.drupal.modules Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: In agents prior to version 3.0 the default for this value was false. Setting this option implied newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail = 1. To enable Drupal module tracking, set this to true. This option has the same performance impact as newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. It will enable the recording of Drupal module functions and call counts, and they will display under the Modules tab, much like web transactions. newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true To enable WordPress hook tracking, set this to true. It will enable the recording of WordPress hooks, plugins, and themes, and they will display under the WordPress tab in the New Relic UI. newrelic.webtransaction.name.files Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" This is the same as newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions, except it uses file names to name the web transaction. The file names can be standard POSIX regular expression to be used with PCRE; for example, \"controllers/actions/.*\". newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Unless the New Relic agent detects a specific framework, such as Drupal or Wordpress, web transactions are named after the initial PHP file; for example, article.php. When the initial file is a dispatcher, this naming scheme produces less than useful data. Use this variable to specify a list of functions that are the \"actions\" generated by the dispatcher. The name of the web transaction will be the first action function executed. Example dispatch function naming If index.php dispatches to functions named: login, logout, admin, show, and edit You would set this value to \"login,logout,admin,show,edit\". The web transactions will be named login, logout, etc. instead of /index.php (the initial file name). newrelic.webtransaction.name.remove_trailing_path Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false When enabled,this removes any content in the request URI after the script name. For example, this would remove the trailing /xyz/zy from /path/to/foo.php/xyz/zy. newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow sql traces. newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. Attribute settings This section lists the settings that affect attribute collection and reporting. newrelic.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the collection of attributes generated by the PHP agent or generated by the user through newrelic_add_custom_parameter(). This setting will take precedence over all other attribute configuration settings. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: True, except for browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Control which destinations receive attributes. These configuration settings will override the .include and .exclude settings. For more information on the destinations available, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.attributes.{include|exclude} Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) This is a family of configuration options that allow fine control over the destinations of attributes. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. Other .ini settings This section lists the remaining newrelic.ini settings. newrelic.enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: (none) Enable or disable the New Relic agent. By default the New Relic PHP agent is enabled for all directories. If you have multiple sites on your web server but only want the PHP agent to monitor specific ones: Make sure newrelic.enabled is set to true at the global (SYSTEM) level in your newrelic.ini file. Set newrelic.enabled to false for one or more specific sites on a per-directory basis (PERDIR). If you need to disable the agent globally, set the newrelic.enabled value to false in the newrelic.ini file. When the agent is globally disabled, it does not initialize completely. It assumes you are globally disabling it for a critical reason, and the agent will attempt to have as close to zero impact on PHP as possible. Important You cannot globally disable the agent and then selectively enable it on a per-directory basis by using .htaccess. newrelic.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/php_agent.log\" This identifies the file name for logging messages. This is useful for debugging any issues with the agent. Whatever you set this to, ensure that: The permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. The user that PHP runs as can write to the file. Usually this is the same user as the web server. newrelic.transaction_events.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report analytics event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. newrelic.error_collector.capture_events Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report error event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show Error analytics. newrelic.feature_flag Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This setting enables new and experimental features within the PHP agent. These flags are used to selectively enable features that are intended to be enabled by default in later versions of the PHP agent. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This enables auto-insertion of the JavaScript fragments for browser monitoring. When enabled will cause the agent to insert a header and a footer in HTML output that will generate metrics on page load timing for the end-user experience. For more information, see Page load timing in PHP. newrelic.guzzle.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables support for the Guzzle library when used with New Relic. PHP agent version 6.4 or higher: This setting is set to true by default. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: Introduced in PHP agent version 9.4 Enables the detection of frameworks and libraries when preloading is enabled. Preloading was introduced in PHP version 7.4. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection will only take effect when opcache.preload is set in the php.ini file.

      "body": "The daemon (newrelic-daemon) acts as a proxy between the PHP agent and the New Relic collector to reduce network traffic and to improve response time for instrumented applications. The daemon process starts when your system starts, and must be running for data to be sent to New Relic. Recommended configuration Beginning with version 3.0 of the PHP agent, the daemon can be automatically configured and started by the agent. Auto-configuration does not require the newrelic.cfg file. This is the recommended configuration. However, there are still some cases where manually starting the daemon is useful. For more information about the startup process, see New Relic daemon startup modes. Manual configuration A sample daemon configuration file was created during installation. To manually configure the daemon, copy and rename newrelic.cfg.template from /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg.template to /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg and edit the file. All settings are optional and most have default values. Important The agent will not automatically start the daemon if it finds a newrelic.cfg file in the /etc/newrelic/ directory. logfile Default: [none] Sets the name of the log file to use. Can be set on the command line by the daemon -l option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg Although the daemon itself provides no default name for the log file, the daemon startup scripts use the -l option to set the default location and name to /var/log/newrelic/newrelic-daemon.log. loglevel Default: info Sets the level of detail for messages sent to the log file. This field has the same possible values as the agent, which are, in increasing order of detail: error warning info debug If you are encountering problems with the daemon, set the log level debug for at least long enough to reproduce the problem. A debug log file is often necessary to debug issues with the proxy daemon. Can be set on the command line using the daemon --loglevel option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg ssl Default: yes This configuration setting is only available in PHP agent versions lower than 8.0. Versions 8.0 and higher will ignore this setting and always use HTTPS encryption to communicate with New Relic. When set to yes, the proxy will only use a secure connection to communicate with the collector. While the setting specifies SSL, the setting refers to HTTPS encryption to the latest industry standards. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to New Relic and the New Relic REST API. Can be enabled or disabled on the command line by the daemon --tls option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg ssl_ca_bundle Default: \"\" Sets the location of a file containing CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this file will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA bundle. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If ssl_ca_path is also set (see below), the certificates in this file will be searched first, followed by the certificates contained in the ssl_ca_path directory. This setting has no effect when ssl is set to false. ssl_ca_path Default: \"\" Sets the location of a directory containing trusted CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this directory will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA path. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If ssl_ca_bundle is also set (see above), it will be searched first followed by the certificates contained in ssl_ca_path. This setting has no effect when ssl is set to false. proxy Default: [none] Certain sites have very restrictive egress firewalls and require you to use a proxy in order to communicate with the outside world. If this applies to your site, you will need to set this value. The value is in the form scheme://user:password@hostname:port. The values scheme, user, password, and port may be omitted depending on your proxy configuration. For example, if you are using a HTTP proxy that does not require a user name and password, you could just use hostname:port. The port defaults to 1080 for most proxies. Can be set on the command line using the daemon --proxy option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg address (alias for port) Default: /tmp/.newrelic.sock Sets the socket endpoint the daemon will listen on. This endpoint allows agents to communicate with the daemon. This must be the same value as the agent's newrelic.daemon.address setting. This can be specified in these ways: Recommended. To use a specified file as a UNIX domain socket (UDS), provide an absolute path name as a string. To use a standard TCP port, specify a number in the range 1 to 65534. To use an abstract socket, use the value @newrelic-daemon (available for agent version 5.2.0.141 or higher). To enable connections from applications that are running on different hosts (helpful for container environments), set this value to host:port, where host denotes the host name or IP address of the local host, and port denotes a valid port number. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported. This is available for PHP agent version 9.2.0.247 or higher. These options may also be set via the command line using the daemon --address option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg. pidfile Default: /tmp/newrelic.pid Sets the name of the file in which the daemon will record its process ID (pid). Although the daemon sets this to a default value of /tmp/newrelic.pid, the startup script almost always uses the --pidfile option to set it to /var/run/newrelic-daemon.pid. Can be set on the command line using the daemon --pidfile option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg auditlog Default: [none] This feature was introduced in version 3.4. When enabled, the agent will create an audit log, which contains all of the data sent from the daemon to New Relic. This data includes the full URL, date, time, and the uncompressed, un-encoded data for each request. This allows you to observe exactly what data is sent to New Relic in order to ensure no sensitive data is included. The file specified can not be the same file as the daemon log, as described above. This audit log can become very large very quickly, so New Relic recommends that you do not use it for extended periods of time. Can be set on the command line using the daemon --auditlog option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Depending on the language agent, available settings may include: Transaction tracing SQL recording and logging SQL query plans Error collection Thread profiling Distributed tracing Cross application tracing Centralization and security Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic UI. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change automatically applies to all New Relic APM agents, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings not available from the UI. Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly within the New Relic UI, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you utilize environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls. Also, server-side configuration is not supported. However, you can change the app name from the UI or from the C SDK configuration settings.

After you enable server-side configuration, you can view and change the available settings through the UI. View or change server-side configuration settings Tip Owner, Admins, or Add-on Managers If you use server-side configuration, you must still include your license_key and app_name in the local config file.

View or change the available configuration settings for your agent. If you make changes, select Save server-side configuration. Once you set any of these options from the UI, they will override any conflicting options in the agent's configuration file. Disable server-side configuration Once you enable server-side configuration for an account, server-side configuration cannot be turned off without assistance from New Relic Support.

This option is often used when there is a single web server serving multiple applications, and you want to adjust settings (for example, the app name) on an application-by-application basis. The process for setting per-directory values depends on the environment. This document describes the three most common environments: Apache PHP-FPM NGINX For other app naming options, see Name your PHP application. Another option: API calls If you are trying to change the name the application reports as, you can use the newrelic_set_appname() API call instead of per-directory settings. For other settings that you can modify with the API, see PHP agent API. If you do not have access to the code for your application, or if you need to isolate your applications to their own virtual hosts for other reasons, then use the following per-directory settings to override any configuration file settings. Apache per-directory settings for PHP When using the PHP module, Apache provides two mechanisms for setting PHP variables outside the INI file: Edit the httpd.conf file or one of the files it includes. Use the syntax from the INI file examples when your web server serves up multiple domains. To view each of these domains separately in New Relic: For your main domain, set newrelic.appname = \"My Main Domain\" in your global INI file. Override the value for each of the virtual hosts by adding php_value entries as part of your virtual host configuration. Important Ensure you use the proper module name for your PHP install. Replace PHP_MODULE in the examples below with the name of the installed PHP5 module. This name depends on the Linux and/or PHP distribution being used. For example, common names include php5_module, mod_php5, php_module, etc. Capitalization may vary. For Apache servers, you can find the module names in one of the following ways. Each will generate a list of installed modules. From the command line, run: apachectl -t -D DUMP_MODULES Copy OR From within a webpage, use: <?php print_r(apache_get_modules()); ?> Copy Setting appname by domain Here is an example of separating domains, where PHP_MODULE is the name of your PHP5 module. <VirtualHost 192.168.42.43> ServerName www.myvhost1.com DocumentRoot \"/path/to/vhost1/\" ... <IfModule PHP_MODULE> php_value newrelic.appname \"Virtual Host 1\" </IfModule> </VirtualHost> <VirtualHost 192.168.123.45> ServerName www.myvhost2.com DocumentRoot \"/path/to/vhost2/\" ... <IfModule PHP_MODULE> php_value newrelic.appname \"Virtual Host 2\" </IfModule> </VirtualHost> Copy In the above example, newrelic.appname is set to a different value for each virtual host. For string and number values, use php_value name VALUE, where: name is the name of the INI setting to modify as listed in the PHP INI settings. VALUE is the value you want to set to for that particular virtual host. Be sure to surround string values in quotes marks \". If you want to change a boolean setting, use the syntax php_flag name VALUE, where name is the variable name as listed in the PHP INI settings, and VALUE is either on or off. To disable the New Relic agent completely for a virtual host, use a boolean flag: <VirtualHost 192.168.56.78> ServerName www.myvhost3.com DocumentRoot \"/path/to/vhost3/\" ... <IfModule PHP_MODULE> php_flag newrelic.enabled off </IfModule> </VirtualHost> Copy Edit the .htaccess file. Use the syntax from the INI file examples inside an .htaccess file. For example: php_value newrelic.appname \"My Blog App\" Copy This allows you to control settings on a per-directory basis from within the directories. In this example, your web server has its document root at /data/webroot. You also have two sub-directories for specialized applications: Your /data/webroot/blog contains a blog application. Your /data/webroot/shop contains a shopping cart application. To have all three portions of your site reported as distinct applications in the New Relic UI: Set the name of your main application in your INI file. Override that name using an .htaccess file in each of the specialized directories. Any part of your web server (for example, /data/webroot/something) that does not have a specific .htaccess file will use the global application name defined in the INI file. Important The .htaccess file must be in the top-level directory for that application. Objects in that directory, or its subdirectories, will use the value specified in the .htaccess file. For more information about using and securing .htaccess files, see the Apache HTTP server tutorial. PHP-FPM per-directory settings The FastCGI Process Manager (PHP-FPM) is dedicated to PHP. It spawns a number of worker processes that wait for requests. It increases performance by not re-initializing the PHP engine on each invocation, allowing each process to deal with a number of requests before it recycles. For more information on PHP-FPM, see PHP-FPM's about page and FastCGI Process Manager on php.net. When using PHP-FPM, there are two mechanisms for setting PHP variables outside the INI file and one special technique for NGINX: Edit the PHP-FPM pool per-directory settings Important Changing variables on a per-directory basis can be more difficult if you use PHP-FPM. You must use multiple PHP-FPM pools, one for each virtual host or unique application. A pool is a dedicated set of worker children that will only serve requests for that pool. Because it requires dedicated worker children, PHP-FPM scales poorly if you have a large number of virtual hosts or applications for which you want to set individual options. To configure PHP-FPM on a per-directory basis: Set the main application name in the INI file. Set up two pools for the two additional applications. Override the application name setting in those pools. Each pool has to have a unique connection mechanism (so you can identify which pool to use in your web server configuration file). Here is an example of php-fpm.conf: [app1] listen=/tmp/pool-app1.sock php_value[newrelic.appname] = \"My App 1\" [app2] listen=/tmp/pool-app2.sock php_value[newrelic.appname] = \"My App 2\" [app3] listen=/tmp/pool-app3.sock php_flag[newrelic.enabled] = off Copy The general format of the per-pool variable settings is php_value[name] = VALUE for string or numeric variables, or php_flag[name] = VALUE for boolean values. Always surround string values with quote marks \". Boolean values must be either on or off. Once the configuration file is set up, the web server must be instructed to use the different pools for different parts of the website. For more information, refer to the documentation for your web server. Create a .user.ini file. You can use the syntax from the INI file example for CGI/FastCGI in a .user.ini file. This is similar to a .htaccess file for Apache but is unique to PHP-FPM. The directory that PHP is executed in is scanned for a .user.ini file. More information about this feature is available in the PHP user.ini files documentation. Change the name of the app using the following steps In the root directory of the web page. Create the .user.ini file Add the setting you wish to change newrelic.appname = \"New Appname\" Save the file. By default, the .user.ini file is read every five minutes so no restart is necessary This is useful in the following scenarios: The server config doesn't work. In NGINX/PHP-FPM setup, there can be a lack of communication between FastCGI and PHP and the information from fastcgi_param PHP_VALUE newrelic.appname=\"Appname\" never reaches PHP. The .htaccess doesn't work, such as where PHP is implemented with suPHP Edit the NGINX config file. Important This section applies only to PHP 5.3.3 or higher. Here is a small fragment of an NGINX config file showing the general procedure to pass values to your FastCGI manager based on an NGINX location. location /blog { fastcgi_param PHP_VALUE \"newrelic.appname=My Blog\"; ... } location /shop { fastcgi_param PHP_VALUE \"newrelic.appname=Shopping Cart\"; ... } location /admin{ fastcgi_param PHP_VALUE \"newrelic.enabled=false\"; ... } Copy Tip A better approach for NGINX may be to use API calls. The following code snippet (for PHP agent 2.7 or higher) is an example. if (extension_loaded ('newrelic')) { newrelic_set_appname (\"My App 1\"); } Copy Roll-up application names If you want to have an overall view of how the server is performing across all virtual hosts or all applications, it is convenient to be able to report to more than one application at a time. For example, report to a virtual host specific application as well as a roll-up application. To do this, set more than one application name for the newrelic.appname parameter by separating each application name with a semicolon. The primary application name is first, and the secondary application names next. You can define up to two extra application names. For example: newrelic.appname=\"Virtual Host 1;All Virtual Hosts\" Copy This will report to two New Relic applications: \"Virtual Host 1\" and \"All Virtual Hosts\". Important This feature is only available in versions 2.4 or higher of the PHP agent.

      "body": "Our PHP agent has a number of settings to fine-tune the types and amounts of data reported. For most users, the default values produce the best possible mix of overhead and utility. However, you can change the settings for your specific needs. Important Always restart your web server after changing INI settings. Otherwise, they may not take effect immediately. Configuration order of precedence Here is a simple illustration of the order of precedence that the PHP agent follows for configuration. Server-side configuration is not applicable. The only values you can change in the UI for apps using the PHP agent are the app's alias and its Apdex-T value. With New Relic's PHP agent, API settings override per-directory configuration settings. Per-directory settings override the php.ini file settings. Server-side configuration is not applicable. Configuration file variables During installation, the newrelic-install script provides information about the configuration files it created or a list of files you need to edit. By default it will attempt to create a configuration file named newrelic.ini. In some cases, you may be instructed to add configuration options to your php.ini file. Only do this if necessary. Exactly which file you need to edit depends on how your particular version (or versions) of PHP were configured. The two most common configurations are: Use a single newrelic.ini file. This is usually the default if you have installed or compiled PHP yourself with no special options. Scan a given directory for all .ini files. If you are unsure which file to edit: From the command line, review the output of php -i. In a browser, review the output of a page containing the script: <?php phpinfo(); ?> Copy If the newrelic.ini file appears, use it. Variable scope Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined scope. The scope controls where the setting can be established or modified. The two scopes supported for New Relic settings are: SYSTEM: Values set globally in the global newrelic.ini file. PERDIR: Values set on a per-directory basis. Each can also be set at a more general level. Valid locations for each are: Can be set for: SYSTEM PERDIR Set in the global newrelic.ini file. Set on a per-directory basis. Important You cannot use ini_set() for New Relic settings. Variable type Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined type. The type specifies the syntax for the value you use. Variable type Formatting and contents String String values can contain any alphanumeric character and punctuation. The value is delimited by quotes. Boolean A logical true or false setting. Valid values are: For true or enabled: on, true, the number 1. For false or disabled: off, false, the number 0. Number Numeric values can only contain digits, plus a period to indicate floats. Unless otherwise stated, all numbers are integers, not floats. Duration A string value delimited by quotes that represent a time duration. Use character flags to delimit time components. If there are no flags, the time is in milliseconds. w\\ = weeks d\\ = days h\\ = hours m\\ = minutes s\\ = seconds ms\\ = milliseconds us\\ = microseconds Example durations: \"1w3d23h10m\"\\ = 1 week, 3 days, 23 hours, and 10 minutes \"5h30m\"\\ = 5 hours and 30 minutes \"500\"\\ = 500 milliseconds General configuration settings These settings are available in the newrelic.ini file. newrelic.appname (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"PHP Application\" This config option sets the application name that data is reported under in APM. We highly recommends that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in New Relic, so set this carefully. For all application-naming options, including per-directory settings, see Name your PHP application. The setting's value is a semicolon-separated list of up to three application names. The first name in the list is the primary application name. It must be unique for each account. The application name is used as a key into a cache. When using multiple names for an app, New Relic only uses the first name for caching. Therefore, each application name can only appear as the first element once. Caching example If you set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App2\" and later in the code set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App3\", the second one will appear not to work. It will report to App1 and App2 because of the caching. If you need overlapping application names, set the common application name in the second or third positions. For example: newrelic.appname=\"App2;App1\" and newrelic.appname=\"App3;App1\". This is useful, for example, when you want to track a superset of applications. newrelic.capture_params Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. To set this value programmatically, use the newrelic_capture_params() API function. If you pass sensitive information directly in the URL, keep this disabled. If set to true, this will enable the recording of parameters passed to a PHP script via the URL (everything after the ? in the URL) in transaction traces. These will appear under the Parameters dropdown when displaying transaction traces. newrelic.framework Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: (auto-detected) The New Relic PHP agent automatically detects the frameworks it supports, but problems may arise if you are using experimental new versions or if you have customized the framework. This setting disables automatic framework detection, instead telling the agent to attempt to name transactions according to the specified framework. Specifying \"no_framework\" will disable framework-related transaction naming entirely. Use any of the following values, as appropriate: \"cakephp\" \"codeigniter\" \"drupal\" (for Drupal 6 and 7) \"drupal8\" \"joomla\" \"kohana\" \"laravel\" \"magento\" \"magento2\" \"mediawiki\" \"silex\" \"symfony1\" \"symfony2\" (for Symfony 2 and 3) \"symfony4\" \"wordpress\" \"yii\" \"zend\" \"zend2\" (for Zend Framework 2 and 3) \"no_framework\" (to force no framework even if one was detected) If the framework auto-detection fails, this command will also fail. newrelic.ignored_params Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. Use the newrelic.ignored_params setting to specify a comma-separated list of parameter names to be excluded from the list of parameters sent to the New Relic servers. Enclose the string values with quote marks. If you enable parameter capturing with newrelic.capture_params, there may be parameters with sensitive user data you do not want to be captured by New Relic or visible in transaction traces. Use this to block the recording of this data. newrelic.license (REQUIRED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Notes: Introduced in agent version 3.0. Sets the New Relic license key to use. In a multi-tenant system this can be set on a per-directory basis. Tip When you upgrade from an old agent version to 3.0 or higher, the license will be removed from your daemon configuration file (with a comment explaining why) and stored in the file /etc/newrelic/upgrade_please.key. Copy the license out of that file and set it in your newrelic.ini file. Delete the upgrade_please.key file. newrelic.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the level of detail of messages sent to the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, include: error warning info verbose debug verbosedebug When reporting any agent issues to New Relic technical support, verbosedebug is the most useful setting. However, this can generate a lot of information very quickly, so avoid keeping the agent at verbosedebug level for longer than it takes to reproduce the problem you are experiencing. When reporting any agent issues to New Relic Technical Support, you may be asked to set this to a custom level, enabling debugging only for certain subsystems. Custom levels are beyond the scope of this document. newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 1 Notes: This used to be newrelic.transaction_tracer.top100. Sets the level of detail in a transaction trace: When set to 1, all server calls are traced. When set to 0, traces only include internally instrumented calls by New Relic and those defined by the user using newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom. The default level of 1 does have a performance impact. If you need to improve performance, try setting the detail level to 0. When not tracing all server calls, blocks of time in transaction traces will be labeled as uninstrumented time, and only certain functions (defined internally by the agent) are instrumented. Even when reporting all calls, there may be uninstrumented time in the traces. newrelic.high_security Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables high security for all applications. When high security is set to true, the following behaviors take effect: Data will not be sent to New Relic unless the newrelic-daemon is using a secure connection (HTTPS). If the PHP process spawns a newrelic-daemon, it will be configured to use HTTPS regardless of the value of newrelic.daemon.ssl. Raw query strings will never be gathered, regardless of the value of newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql. Request attributes will never be captured, regardless of the newrelic.attributes configuration settings. The newrelic_add_custom_parameter and newrelic_set_user_attributes API function will have no effect, and they will return false. The newrelic_record_custom_event API function will not submit any events to New Relic. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Caution If you change the newrelic.high_security setting, you must also change the security setting in the APM user interface. If the two settings do not match, then no data will be collected. For more information, see High security. newrelic.labels Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Adds tags. Example tags \"Server:One;Data Center:Primary\" Copy newrelic.process_host.display_name Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. Daemon .ini settings The values of these settings control the daemon startup. When the agent detects that the daemon needs to be started, it will convert these options into the appropriate command line options for the daemon. All of these settings mirror the settings in the newrelic.cfg file. They are repeated here to keep all of the .ini settings in one place. Each setting in newrelic.cfg has its counterpart here, with newrelic.daemon. as the prefix. For example, the ssl setting in newrelic.cfg is newrelic.daemon.ssl in an .ini file. Important If the file /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent ignores these settings, and the agent will not start the daemon automatically. For more information about ways to start the daemon and when to use an external configuration file, see PHP daemon startup modes. newrelic.daemon.app_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"5m\" or \"1h20m\" Default: \"10m\" Sets the elapsed time after which an application will be considered inactive. Inactive applications do not count against the maximum limit of 250 applications. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". A value of 0 will be interpreted as \"no timeout.\" This will result in new applications always counting towards the 250 application limit, as well as the daemon being unable to release a small amount of memory per application back to the operating system. Recommendation: Do not use this value unless New Relic Support requests it. Instead, for occasional background transactions, use a value of twice the interval. For example, for an hourly background job, set the timeout to 2 hours. newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon connecting an application. A value of 0 causes the agent to only make one attempt at connecting to the daemon. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". With this timeout set, the agent will not immediately drop a transaction when the daemon hasn't connected to the backend yet, but rather grant the daemon time to establish the connection. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 15s. Only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of connection problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. newrelic.daemon.auditlog Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" The setting specifies the name of an audit log, which will contain all of the data sent from the daemon to the New Relic servers, including the full URL, date, time, and the uncompressed, unencoded data for each request. This file cannot be the same file as the daemon log. Important This audit log can become very large, very quickly. Avoid using the newrelic.daemon.auditlog setting for extended periods of time. Its primary purpose is to allow system administrators to perform security reviews and to observe exactly what data transmits. newrelic.daemon.collector_host Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"collector.newrelic.com\" Sets the name and optional port of the collector host which the daemon will contact to verify your license key and send agent data. This is either just the name of the host or the name and port number in the form \"hostname:port\". Specifying a port number of 0 will use the default port, which is 80. Caution Do not change this value without guidance from New Relic Support. newrelic.daemon.dont_launch Scope: SYSTEM Type: Number Default: 0 If you prefer to have the daemon launched externally before the agent starts up, this value determines when the agent is allowed to start the daemon: 0: No restrictions are placed on daemon startup and the agent can start the daemon any time. 1: Non-command line (such as Apache or php-fpm) agents can start the daemon. 2: Only command line agents can start the daemon. 3: The agent will never start the daemon. Use this setting if you are configuring the daemon via newrelic.cfg and starting it outside of the agent. Important If /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent assumes the daemon is meant to be started by its startup script, not via the agent. This setting has no meaning to and does not appear in newrelic.cfg. newrelic.daemon.location Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/usr/bin/newrelic-daemon\" Sets the name of the daemon executable to launch. This variable identifies the full path to the daemon executable file. If the New Relic system was installed using the standard packages, the default location will be correct. If you have installed to a custom location using the tar distribution (and do not have permission to write to /usr/bin), then the daemon may reside at another location. This setting does not appear in the newrelic.cfg file as it is only relevant to PHP. Important On OpenSolaris, /usr is frequently a read-only file system. The default daemon location for OpenSolaris is /opt/newrelic/bin/newrelic-daemon. newrelic.daemon.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/newrelic-daemon.log\" Sets the name of the log file to record daemon specific log messages. This file must be writable by the daemon. The most common case is that the Apache user will end up starting the daemon when Apache itself starts up, thus you should ensure that the file is writable by whichever user runs the Apache process. Caution If the daemon log file is not writable, the daemon will not start automatically, which will prevent data from reporting. You can use write permissions to this file as a means of restricting who can start the daemon. newrelic.daemon.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the detail level for messages recorded to New Relic's daemon log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: error warning info debug The more verbose settings can generate a lot of information very quickly. When necessary, set debug for short periods of time to identify problems. newrelic.daemon.pidfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: (depends on OS) Sets the name of the file in which the daemon will record its process ID (pid). This file is used by the daemon startup and shutdown script to determine whether or not the daemon is already running. newrelic.daemon.address (alias for newrelic.daemon.port) Scope: SYSTEM Type: String or Number Default: \"@newrelic\" on Linux, \"/tmp/.newrelic.sock\" otherwise Tip From v9.2.0.247, the PHP agent supports a new setting, newrelic.daemon.address,which serves as an alias to newrelic.daemon.port. You can use either to specify the location of the New Relic PHP daemon. If both values are set, newrelic.daemon.address takes precedence. Sets the socket endpoint for agent to daemon communications. This can be specified in four ways. To use a specified file as a UNIX domain socket (UDS), provide an absolute path name as a string. This is the default on non-Linux systems. To use a standard TCP port, specify a number in the range 1 to 65534. To use an abstract socket, use the value @newrelic-daemon (available for agent version 5.2.0.141 or higher). This is the default on Linux systems. To connect to a daemon that is running on a different host (helpful for container environments), set this value to host:port, where host denotes either a host name or an IP, and port denotes a valid port number. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported. This is available for agent version 9.2.0.247 or higher. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. We recommend only using a private network connection between the agent and daemon (this only applies when the agent and daemon are running on different hosts). If you use port numbers, Unix systems require that ports in the range 1 to 1023 require the daemon be run as the super-user. In case the daemon uses a non-standard port, this variable also sets the port number the agent will use for communicating with the daemon. Important If you're using the newrelic.cfg startup mechanism for the daemon, this setting and the address setting in that file must match. newrelic.daemon.proxy Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the host and user credentials to use as an egress proxy. This is only used if your site requires a proxy in order to access the New Relic data collection servers. It can take any of the following forms, depending on the proxy setup: hostname hostname:port user@hostname user@hostname:port user:password@hostname user:password@hostname:port proxytype://user:password@hostname:port A proxy type of HTTP is assumed unless another proxytype is specified. In that case, proxytype can be one of http, socks4, socks4a, or socks5. newrelic.daemon.ssl Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true This setting is ignored on PHP agent versions 8.0 and higher, and HTTPS will always be used to communicate with New Relic. On versions of the PHP agent versions lower than 8.0, controls whether or not communication with New Relic collectors should use a secure HTTP connection. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a file containing CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this file will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA bundle. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path is also set, the certificates in this file will be searched first, followed by the certificates contained in the newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path directory. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a directory containing trusted CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this directory will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA path. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle is also set, it will be searched first followed by the certificates contained in newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.start_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon to start after a daemon launch was triggered. A value of 0 causes the agent to not wait. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\" and \"h\". The specified timeout value will be passed to the daemon via the --wait-for-port flag. This causes daemon startup to block until a socket is acquired or until the timeout is elapsed. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 2s to 5s. It is recommended to only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of daemon start problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. Transaction tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Set this to a comma-separated list of user defined functions or methods to instrument: \"myfunction,myclass::method,otherfunction\" Copy Internal PHP functions cannot have custom tracing. You can add to the list of custom functions with each PERDIR file, but you cannot remove a function or method that has already been added. If you want to programmatically add functions or methods to be instrumented, use the newrelic_add_custom_tracer() API function call. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables the transaction tracer. The tracer creates a detailed transaction trace for transactions that take more time than the threshold, as set by the newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold value. Only one transaction trace per application per harvest cycle is stored and it is always the slowest transaction during that cycle. Transaction traces are useful for diagnosing why a particular transaction was slow. Unless memory and performance are critical, they should almost never be disabled. Enabling this does have a very slight performance impact and does use more memory. For more information, see newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables requesting explain plans from MySQLi and PDO MySQL libraries for slow query calls. Explain plans will only be available when newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql is set to true and newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is not set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" Sets the threshold beyond which queries are considered \"slow\" and thus candidates for the Slow Queries page. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.internal_functions_enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables or disables support for tracing internal functions (that is, functions written in C and provided either via the PHP standard library or PECL extensions). When enabled, internal functions appear in transaction traces like functions written in PHP. Enabling this option may result in transactions being slower, especially when collecting many traces from PHP 5.x. Enabling this option is only recommended when specifically debugging performance issues where an internal function is suspected to be slow. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"obfuscated\" Sets how queries are recorded (if at all). When recording transaction traces internally, the full query for slow query calls is recorded. Sending this query to New Relic can have serious security implications, so by default, all database statements are obfuscated before being sent to New Relic. The obfuscation is not reversible, as it replaces strings and numbers in any query with question marks. The only things that survive intact are field names, not any of their values. If you are testing with data that is not sensitive and you need to see the raw queries in transaction traces, set this to \"raw\". If you do not want queries recorded at all, set this to \"off\". Important Always set this back to \"obfuscated\" or \"off\" in any production environment. newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable the Slow Queries feature. When enabled, it will: Record the top 10 slowest database queries per application per minute. Create a stack trace leading up to the query. If this variable is set to false or SQL recording is disabled, the New Relic agent does not gather any slow query data. newrelic.transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" This sets the threshold above which the agent will record the full PHP stack for transaction traces for which queries are being recorded. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" Stack traces can consume memory, so be careful of setting this value too low. This variable has no meaning if newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"apdex_f\" Use this variable to set the threshold beyond which transactions are eligible for being traced. Available values include: Use \"apdex_f\" to set the threshold to 4 times the application's apdex_t value. For more information, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. Use any other duration string to set a specific time threshold. Specify the duration as an absolute value and the unit of measurement. If none is specified, the unit defaults to millisecond. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.gather_input_queries Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable gathering of DQL input queries with Slow Queries and Transaction Traces. When enabled, these will appear along with slow queries and transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 0 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for web transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP web processes; it will not effect PHP CLI processes. To set a limit for CLI processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 100000 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for CLI transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP CLI processes; it will not effect PHP web processes. To set a limit for web processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web. Other tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control various tracer features. newrelic.cross_application_tracer.enabled Important A distributed tracing feature is available. Distributed tracing improves on cross application tracing and is recommended for monitoring activity in complex distributed systems. Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the cross application tracer. The cross application tracer inserts HTTP headers into outbound requests and the response in order to link together web transaction metrics and transaction traces between applications. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the PHP agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross-application tracing. Before enabling, read the transition guide to understand effects on New Relic features. Enable or disable distributed tracing. When the agent's transaction tracer and distributed tracing features are enabled, the agent will insert headers into outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic distributed tracing header that is attached to outbound requests, and to instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are attached to outbound requests. The New Relic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that do not support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over New Relic headers for distributed tracing. newrelic.span_events_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Span event reporting requires distributed tracing to be enabled. This option enables/disables the reporting of span events. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: \"\" Configures the Trace Observer used for Infinite Tracing. If empty, Infinite Tracing support will be disabled. This requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer Default: 443 Configures the TCP/IP port used to communicate with the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. This setting is ignored if newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host is empty. This setting will not usually need to be changed. newrelic.infinite_tracing.span_events.queue_size Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer (1000 or higher) Default: 100000 Sets the number of span events that can be queued for transmission to the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. The agent internally manages span events for Infinite Tracing in span batches. Those span batches can hold a maximum of 1000 spans. Therefore, the span events queue size cannot be lower than 1000, as otherwise not even a single span batch can be queued. If a queue size lower than 1000 is specified, the minimum size of 1000 is used. newrelic.error_collector.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the error collector. When enabled, the agent collects and reports PHP errors to the New Relic UI. The agent records only the single most severe error for each transaction, and up to 20 errors per harvest cycle. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. newrelic.error_collector.record_database_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When enabled, the agent collects errors returned by MySQL functions as if they were PHP errors. newrelic.error_collector.prioritize_api_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to assign the highest priority to errors identified through the newrelic_notice_error() API function. newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) A comma separated list of fully-qualified exception class names that the agent should ignore. When an unhandled exception occurs, the agent will perform the equivalent of $exception instanceof Class for each of the classes listed. If any of those checks returns true, the agent will not record an exception. Depending on the supported PHP release, these values are equivalent to disabling exception reporting: Supported PHP 5 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Exceptions Supported PHP 7 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Throwable newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer or a bitwise expression of PHP-defined error constants Default: 0 Sets the error levels for the PHP agent to ignore. The value for this setting uses similar syntax to PHP's error_reporting option. For example, to configure the PHP agent to ignore E_WARNING and E_ERROR level errors, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_WARNING | E_ERROR or newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = 3 To configure the PHP agent to ignore everything but E_WARNING, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_ALL & ~E_WARNING newrelic.framework.drupal.modules Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: In agents prior to version 3.0 the default for this value was false. Setting this option implied newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail = 1. To enable Drupal module tracking, set this to true. This option has the same performance impact as newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. It will enable the recording of Drupal module functions and call counts, and they will display under the Modules tab, much like web transactions. newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true To enable WordPress hook tracking, set this to true. It will enable the recording of WordPress hooks, plugins, and themes, and they will display under the WordPress tab in the New Relic UI. newrelic.webtransaction.name.files Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" This is the same as newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions, except it uses file names to name the web transaction. The file names can be standard POSIX regular expression to be used with PCRE; for example, \"controllers/actions/.*\". newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Unless the New Relic agent detects a specific framework, such as Drupal or Wordpress, web transactions are named after the initial PHP file; for example, article.php. When the initial file is a dispatcher, this naming scheme produces less than useful data. Use this variable to specify a list of functions that are the \"actions\" generated by the dispatcher. The name of the web transaction will be the first action function executed. Example dispatch function naming If index.php dispatches to functions named: login, logout, admin, show, and edit You would set this value to \"login,logout,admin,show,edit\". The web transactions will be named login, logout, etc. instead of /index.php (the initial file name). newrelic.webtransaction.name.remove_trailing_path Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false When enabled,this removes any content in the request URI after the script name. For example, this would remove the trailing /xyz/zy from /path/to/foo.php/xyz/zy. newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow sql traces. newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. Attribute settings This section lists the settings that affect attribute collection and reporting. newrelic.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the collection of attributes generated by the PHP agent or generated by the user through newrelic_add_custom_parameter(). This setting will take precedence over all other attribute configuration settings. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: True, except for browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Control which destinations receive attributes. These configuration settings will override the .include and .exclude settings. For more information on the destinations available, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.attributes.{include|exclude} Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) This is a family of configuration options that allow fine control over the destinations of attributes. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. Other .ini settings This section lists the remaining newrelic.ini settings. newrelic.enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: (none) Enable or disable the New Relic agent. By default the New Relic PHP agent is enabled for all directories. If you have multiple sites on your web server but only want the PHP agent to monitor specific ones: Make sure newrelic.enabled is set to true at the global (SYSTEM) level in your newrelic.ini file. Set newrelic.enabled to false for one or more specific sites on a per-directory basis (PERDIR). If you need to disable the agent globally, set the newrelic.enabled value to false in the newrelic.ini file. When the agent is globally disabled, it does not initialize completely. It assumes you are globally disabling it for a critical reason, and the agent will attempt to have as close to zero impact on PHP as possible. Important You cannot globally disable the agent and then selectively enable it on a per-directory basis by using .htaccess. newrelic.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/php_agent.log\" This identifies the file name for logging messages. This is useful for debugging any issues with the agent. Whatever you set this to, ensure that: The permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. The user that PHP runs as can write to the file. Usually this is the same user as the web server. newrelic.transaction_events.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report analytics event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. newrelic.error_collector.capture_events Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report error event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show Error analytics. newrelic.feature_flag Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This setting enables new and experimental features within the PHP agent. These flags are used to selectively enable features that are intended to be enabled by default in later versions of the PHP agent. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This enables auto-insertion of the JavaScript fragments for browser monitoring. When enabled will cause the agent to insert a header and a footer in HTML output that will generate metrics on page load timing for the end-user experience. For more information, see Page load timing in PHP. newrelic.guzzle.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables support for the Guzzle library when used with New Relic. PHP agent version 6.4 or higher: This setting is set to true by default. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: Introduced in PHP agent version 9.4 Enables the detection of frameworks and libraries when preloading is enabled. Preloading was introduced in PHP version 7.4. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection will only take effect when opcache.preload is set in the php.ini file.

      "body": "The daemon (newrelic-daemon) acts as a proxy between the PHP agent and the New Relic collector to reduce network traffic and to improve response time for instrumented applications. The daemon process starts when your system starts, and must be running for data to be sent to New Relic. Recommended configuration Beginning with version 3.0 of the PHP agent, the daemon can be automatically configured and started by the agent. Auto-configuration does not require the newrelic.cfg file. This is the recommended configuration. However, there are still some cases where manually starting the daemon is useful. For more information about the startup process, see New Relic daemon startup modes. Manual configuration A sample daemon configuration file was created during installation. To manually configure the daemon, copy and rename newrelic.cfg.template from /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg.template to /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg and edit the file. All settings are optional and most have default values. Important The agent will not automatically start the daemon if it finds a newrelic.cfg file in the /etc/newrelic/ directory. logfile Default: [none] Sets the name of the log file to use. Can be set on the command line by the daemon -l option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg Although the daemon itself provides no default name for the log file, the daemon startup scripts use the -l option to set the default location and name to /var/log/newrelic/newrelic-daemon.log. loglevel Default: info Sets the level of detail for messages sent to the log file. This field has the same possible values as the agent, which are, in increasing order of detail: error warning info debug If you are encountering problems with the daemon, set the log level debug for at least long enough to reproduce the problem. A debug log file is often necessary to debug issues with the proxy daemon. Can be set on the command line using the daemon --loglevel option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg ssl Default: yes This configuration setting is only available in PHP agent versions lower than 8.0. Versions 8.0 and higher will ignore this setting and always use HTTPS encryption to communicate with New Relic. When set to yes, the proxy will only use a secure connection to communicate with the collector. While the setting specifies SSL, the setting refers to HTTPS encryption to the latest industry standards. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to New Relic and the New Relic REST API. Can be enabled or disabled on the command line by the daemon --tls option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg ssl_ca_bundle Default: \"\" Sets the location of a file containing CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this file will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA bundle. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If ssl_ca_path is also set (see below), the certificates in this file will be searched first, followed by the certificates contained in the ssl_ca_path directory. This setting has no effect when ssl is set to false. ssl_ca_path Default: \"\" Sets the location of a directory containing trusted CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this directory will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA path. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If ssl_ca_bundle is also set (see above), it will be searched first followed by the certificates contained in ssl_ca_path. This setting has no effect when ssl is set to false. proxy Default: [none] Certain sites have very restrictive egress firewalls and require you to use a proxy in order to communicate with the outside world. If this applies to your site, you will need to set this value. The value is in the form scheme://user:password@hostname:port. The values scheme, user, password, and port may be omitted depending on your proxy configuration. For example, if you are using a HTTP proxy that does not require a user name and password, you could just use hostname:port. The port defaults to 1080 for most proxies. Can be set on the command line using the daemon --proxy option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg address (alias for port) Default: /tmp/.newrelic.sock Sets the socket endpoint the daemon will listen on. This endpoint allows agents to communicate with the daemon. This must be the same value as the agent's newrelic.daemon.address setting. This can be specified in these ways: Recommended. To use a specified file as a UNIX domain socket (UDS), provide an absolute path name as a string. To use a standard TCP port, specify a number in the range 1 to 65534. To use an abstract socket, use the value @newrelic-daemon (available for agent version 5.2.0.141 or higher). To enable connections from applications that are running on different hosts (helpful for container environments), set this value to host:port, where host denotes the host name or IP address of the local host, and port denotes a valid port number. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported. This is available for PHP agent version 9.2.0.247 or higher. These options may also be set via the command line using the daemon --address option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg. pidfile Default: /tmp/newrelic.pid Sets the name of the file in which the daemon will record its process ID (pid). Although the daemon sets this to a default value of /tmp/newrelic.pid, the startup script almost always uses the --pidfile option to set it to /var/run/newrelic-daemon.pid. Can be set on the command line using the daemon --pidfile option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg auditlog Default: [none] This feature was introduced in version 3.4. When enabled, the agent will create an audit log, which contains all of the data sent from the daemon to New Relic. This data includes the full URL, date, time, and the uncompressed, un-encoded data for each request. This allows you to observe exactly what data is sent to New Relic in order to ensure no sensitive data is included. The file specified can not be the same file as the daemon log, as described above. This audit log can become very large very quickly, so New Relic recommends that you do not use it for extended periods of time. Can be set on the command line using the daemon --auditlog option. Setting this value on the command line will override the value set in newrelic.cfg For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Depending on the language agent, available settings may include: Transaction tracing SQL recording and logging SQL query plans Error collection Thread profiling Distributed tracing Cross application tracing Centralization and security Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic UI. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change automatically applies to all New Relic APM agents, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings not available from the UI. Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly within the New Relic UI, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you utilize environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls. Also, server-side configuration is not supported. However, you can change the app name from the UI or from the C SDK configuration settings.

View or change the available configuration settings for your agent. If you make changes, select Save server-side configuration. Once you set any of these options from the UI, they will override any conflicting options in the agent's configuration file. Disable server-side configuration Once you enable server-side configuration for an account, server-side configuration cannot be turned off without assistance from New Relic Support.

      "body": "Our PHP agent has a number of settings to fine-tune the types and amounts of data reported. For most users, the default values produce the best possible mix of overhead and utility. However, you can change the settings for your specific needs. Important Always restart your web server after changing INI settings. Otherwise, they may not take effect immediately. Configuration order of precedence Here is a simple illustration of the order of precedence that the PHP agent follows for configuration. Server-side configuration is not applicable. The only values you can change in the UI for apps using the PHP agent are the app's alias and its Apdex-T value. With New Relic's PHP agent, API settings override per-directory configuration settings. Per-directory settings override the php.ini file settings. Server-side configuration is not applicable. Configuration file variables During installation, the newrelic-install script provides information about the configuration files it created or a list of files you need to edit. By default it will attempt to create a configuration file named newrelic.ini. In some cases, you may be instructed to add configuration options to your php.ini file. Only do this if necessary. Exactly which file you need to edit depends on how your particular version (or versions) of PHP were configured. The two most common configurations are: Use a single newrelic.ini file. This is usually the default if you have installed or compiled PHP yourself with no special options. Scan a given directory for all .ini files. If you are unsure which file to edit: From the command line, review the output of php -i. In a browser, review the output of a page containing the script: <?php phpinfo(); ?> Copy If the newrelic.ini file appears, use it. Variable scope Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined scope. The scope controls where the setting can be established or modified. The two scopes supported for New Relic settings are: SYSTEM: Values set globally in the global newrelic.ini file. PERDIR: Values set on a per-directory basis. Each can also be set at a more general level. Valid locations for each are: Can be set for: SYSTEM PERDIR Set in the global newrelic.ini file. Set on a per-directory basis. Important You cannot use ini_set() for New Relic settings. Variable type Each variable for your newrelic.ini file has a defined type. The type specifies the syntax for the value you use. Variable type Formatting and contents String String values can contain any alphanumeric character and punctuation. The value is delimited by quotes. Boolean A logical true or false setting. Valid values are: For true or enabled: on, true, the number 1. For false or disabled: off, false, the number 0. Number Numeric values can only contain digits, plus a period to indicate floats. Unless otherwise stated, all numbers are integers, not floats. Duration A string value delimited by quotes that represent a time duration. Use character flags to delimit time components. If there are no flags, the time is in milliseconds. w\\ = weeks d\\ = days h\\ = hours m\\ = minutes s\\ = seconds ms\\ = milliseconds us\\ = microseconds Example durations: \"1w3d23h10m\"\\ = 1 week, 3 days, 23 hours, and 10 minutes \"5h30m\"\\ = 5 hours and 30 minutes \"500\"\\ = 500 milliseconds General configuration settings These settings are available in the newrelic.ini file. newrelic.appname (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"PHP Application\" This config option sets the application name that data is reported under in APM. We highly recommends that you replace the default name with a descriptive name to avoid confusion and unintended aggregation of data. Data for all applications with the same name will be merged in New Relic, so set this carefully. For all application-naming options, including per-directory settings, see Name your PHP application. The setting's value is a semicolon-separated list of up to three application names. The first name in the list is the primary application name. It must be unique for each account. The application name is used as a key into a cache. When using multiple names for an app, New Relic only uses the first name for caching. Therefore, each application name can only appear as the first element once. Caching example If you set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App2\" and later in the code set newrelic.appname=\"App1;App3\", the second one will appear not to work. It will report to App1 and App2 because of the caching. If you need overlapping application names, set the common application name in the second or third positions. For example: newrelic.appname=\"App2;App1\" and newrelic.appname=\"App3;App1\". This is useful, for example, when you want to track a superset of applications. newrelic.capture_params Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. To set this value programmatically, use the newrelic_capture_params() API function. If you pass sensitive information directly in the URL, keep this disabled. If set to true, this will enable the recording of parameters passed to a PHP script via the URL (everything after the ? in the URL) in transaction traces. These will appear under the Parameters dropdown when displaying transaction traces. newrelic.framework Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: (auto-detected) The New Relic PHP agent automatically detects the frameworks it supports, but problems may arise if you are using experimental new versions or if you have customized the framework. This setting disables automatic framework detection, instead telling the agent to attempt to name transactions according to the specified framework. Specifying \"no_framework\" will disable framework-related transaction naming entirely. Use any of the following values, as appropriate: \"cakephp\" \"codeigniter\" \"drupal\" (for Drupal 6 and 7) \"drupal8\" \"joomla\" \"kohana\" \"laravel\" \"magento\" \"magento2\" \"mediawiki\" \"silex\" \"symfony1\" \"symfony2\" (for Symfony 2 and 3) \"symfony4\" \"wordpress\" \"yii\" \"zend\" \"zend2\" (for Zend Framework 2 and 3) \"no_framework\" (to force no framework even if one was detected) If the framework auto-detection fails, this command will also fail. newrelic.ignored_params Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Caution This setting has been deprecated and may not behave as expected. Instead, use attribute properties. Use the newrelic.ignored_params setting to specify a comma-separated list of parameter names to be excluded from the list of parameters sent to the New Relic servers. Enclose the string values with quote marks. If you enable parameter capturing with newrelic.capture_params, there may be parameters with sensitive user data you do not want to be captured by New Relic or visible in transaction traces. Use this to block the recording of this data. newrelic.license (REQUIRED) Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Notes: Introduced in agent version 3.0. Sets the New Relic license key to use. In a multi-tenant system this can be set on a per-directory basis. Tip When you upgrade from an old agent version to 3.0 or higher, the license will be removed from your daemon configuration file (with a comment explaining why) and stored in the file /etc/newrelic/upgrade_please.key. Copy the license out of that file and set it in your newrelic.ini file. Delete the upgrade_please.key file. newrelic.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the level of detail of messages sent to the log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, include: error warning info verbose debug verbosedebug When reporting any agent issues to New Relic technical support, verbosedebug is the most useful setting. However, this can generate a lot of information very quickly, so avoid keeping the agent at verbosedebug level for longer than it takes to reproduce the problem you are experiencing. When reporting any agent issues to New Relic Technical Support, you may be asked to set this to a custom level, enabling debugging only for certain subsystems. Custom levels are beyond the scope of this document. newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 1 Notes: This used to be newrelic.transaction_tracer.top100. Sets the level of detail in a transaction trace: When set to 1, all server calls are traced. When set to 0, traces only include internally instrumented calls by New Relic and those defined by the user using newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom. The default level of 1 does have a performance impact. If you need to improve performance, try setting the detail level to 0. When not tracing all server calls, blocks of time in transaction traces will be labeled as uninstrumented time, and only certain functions (defined internally by the agent) are instrumented. Even when reporting all calls, there may be uninstrumented time in the traces. newrelic.high_security Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables high security for all applications. When high security is set to true, the following behaviors take effect: Data will not be sent to New Relic unless the newrelic-daemon is using a secure connection (HTTPS). If the PHP process spawns a newrelic-daemon, it will be configured to use HTTPS regardless of the value of newrelic.daemon.ssl. Raw query strings will never be gathered, regardless of the value of newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql. Request attributes will never be captured, regardless of the newrelic.attributes configuration settings. The newrelic_add_custom_parameter and newrelic_set_user_attributes API function will have no effect, and they will return false. The newrelic_record_custom_event API function will not submit any events to New Relic. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Caution If you change the newrelic.high_security setting, you must also change the security setting in the APM user interface. If the two settings do not match, then no data will be collected. For more information, see High security. newrelic.labels Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Adds tags. Example tags \"Server:One;Data Center:Primary\" Copy newrelic.process_host.display_name Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the hostname to be displayed in the APM UI. If set, this overrides the default hostname that the agent captures automatically. Daemon .ini settings The values of these settings control the daemon startup. When the agent detects that the daemon needs to be started, it will convert these options into the appropriate command line options for the daemon. All of these settings mirror the settings in the newrelic.cfg file. They are repeated here to keep all of the .ini settings in one place. Each setting in newrelic.cfg has its counterpart here, with newrelic.daemon. as the prefix. For example, the ssl setting in newrelic.cfg is newrelic.daemon.ssl in an .ini file. Important If the file /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent ignores these settings, and the agent will not start the daemon automatically. For more information about ways to start the daemon and when to use an external configuration file, see PHP daemon startup modes. newrelic.daemon.app_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"5m\" or \"1h20m\" Default: \"10m\" Sets the elapsed time after which an application will be considered inactive. Inactive applications do not count against the maximum limit of 250 applications. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". A value of 0 will be interpreted as \"no timeout.\" This will result in new applications always counting towards the 250 application limit, as well as the daemon being unable to release a small amount of memory per application back to the operating system. Recommendation: Do not use this value unless New Relic Support requests it. Instead, for occasional background transactions, use a value of twice the interval. For example, for an hourly background job, set the timeout to 2 hours. newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon connecting an application. A value of 0 causes the agent to only make one attempt at connecting to the daemon. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\", and \"h\". With this timeout set, the agent will not immediately drop a transaction when the daemon hasn't connected to the backend yet, but rather grant the daemon time to establish the connection. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 15s. Only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of connection problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. newrelic.daemon.auditlog Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" The setting specifies the name of an audit log, which will contain all of the data sent from the daemon to the New Relic servers, including the full URL, date, time, and the uncompressed, unencoded data for each request. This file cannot be the same file as the daemon log. Important This audit log can become very large, very quickly. Avoid using the newrelic.daemon.auditlog setting for extended periods of time. Its primary purpose is to allow system administrators to perform security reviews and to observe exactly what data transmits. newrelic.daemon.collector_host Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"collector.newrelic.com\" Sets the name and optional port of the collector host which the daemon will contact to verify your license key and send agent data. This is either just the name of the host or the name and port number in the form \"hostname:port\". Specifying a port number of 0 will use the default port, which is 80. Caution Do not change this value without guidance from New Relic Support. newrelic.daemon.dont_launch Scope: SYSTEM Type: Number Default: 0 If you prefer to have the daemon launched externally before the agent starts up, this value determines when the agent is allowed to start the daemon: 0: No restrictions are placed on daemon startup and the agent can start the daemon any time. 1: Non-command line (such as Apache or php-fpm) agents can start the daemon. 2: Only command line agents can start the daemon. 3: The agent will never start the daemon. Use this setting if you are configuring the daemon via newrelic.cfg and starting it outside of the agent. Important If /etc/newrelic/newrelic.cfg exists, the agent assumes the daemon is meant to be started by its startup script, not via the agent. This setting has no meaning to and does not appear in newrelic.cfg. newrelic.daemon.location Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/usr/bin/newrelic-daemon\" Sets the name of the daemon executable to launch. This variable identifies the full path to the daemon executable file. If the New Relic system was installed using the standard packages, the default location will be correct. If you have installed to a custom location using the tar distribution (and do not have permission to write to /usr/bin), then the daemon may reside at another location. This setting does not appear in the newrelic.cfg file as it is only relevant to PHP. Important On OpenSolaris, /usr is frequently a read-only file system. The default daemon location for OpenSolaris is /opt/newrelic/bin/newrelic-daemon. newrelic.daemon.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/newrelic-daemon.log\" Sets the name of the log file to record daemon specific log messages. This file must be writable by the daemon. The most common case is that the Apache user will end up starting the daemon when Apache itself starts up, thus you should ensure that the file is writable by whichever user runs the Apache process. Caution If the daemon log file is not writable, the daemon will not start automatically, which will prevent data from reporting. You can use write permissions to this file as a means of restricting who can start the daemon. newrelic.daemon.loglevel Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"info\" Sets the detail level for messages recorded to New Relic's daemon log file. Possible values, in increasing order of detail, are: error warning info debug The more verbose settings can generate a lot of information very quickly. When necessary, set debug for short periods of time to identify problems. newrelic.daemon.pidfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: (depends on OS) Sets the name of the file in which the daemon will record its process ID (pid). This file is used by the daemon startup and shutdown script to determine whether or not the daemon is already running. newrelic.daemon.address (alias for newrelic.daemon.port) Scope: SYSTEM Type: String or Number Default: \"@newrelic\" on Linux, \"/tmp/.newrelic.sock\" otherwise Tip From v9.2.0.247, the PHP agent supports a new setting, newrelic.daemon.address,which serves as an alias to newrelic.daemon.port. You can use either to specify the location of the New Relic PHP daemon. If both values are set, newrelic.daemon.address takes precedence. Sets the socket endpoint for agent to daemon communications. This can be specified in four ways. To use a specified file as a UNIX domain socket (UDS), provide an absolute path name as a string. This is the default on non-Linux systems. To use a standard TCP port, specify a number in the range 1 to 65534. To use an abstract socket, use the value @newrelic-daemon (available for agent version 5.2.0.141 or higher). This is the default on Linux systems. To connect to a daemon that is running on a different host (helpful for container environments), set this value to host:port, where host denotes either a host name or an IP, and port denotes a valid port number. Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported. This is available for agent version 9.2.0.247 or higher. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. We recommend only using a private network connection between the agent and daemon (this only applies when the agent and daemon are running on different hosts). If you use port numbers, Unix systems require that ports in the range 1 to 1023 require the daemon be run as the super-user. In case the daemon uses a non-standard port, this variable also sets the port number the agent will use for communicating with the daemon. Important If you're using the newrelic.cfg startup mechanism for the daemon, this setting and the address setting in that file must match. newrelic.daemon.proxy Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the host and user credentials to use as an egress proxy. This is only used if your site requires a proxy in order to access the New Relic data collection servers. It can take any of the following forms, depending on the proxy setup: hostname hostname:port user@hostname user@hostname:port user:password@hostname user:password@hostname:port proxytype://user:password@hostname:port A proxy type of HTTP is assumed unless another proxytype is specified. In that case, proxytype can be one of http, socks4, socks4a, or socks5. newrelic.daemon.ssl Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true This setting is ignored on PHP agent versions 8.0 and higher, and HTTPS will always be used to communicate with New Relic. On versions of the PHP agent versions lower than 8.0, controls whether or not communication with New Relic collectors should use a secure HTTP connection. The agent communicates with New Relic via HTTPS by default, and New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the New Relic REST API. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a file containing CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this file will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA bundle. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path is also set, the certificates in this file will be searched first, followed by the certificates contained in the newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path directory. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Sets the location of a directory containing trusted CA certificates in PEM format. When set, the certificates in this directory will be used to authenticate the New Relic collector. In most cases it should not be necessary to configure a CA path. The New Relic PHP agent comes bundled with the necessary CA certificates. If newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_bundle is also set, it will be searched first followed by the certificates contained in newrelic.daemon.ssl_ca_path. This setting has no effect when newrelic.daemon.ssl is set to false. newrelic.daemon.start_timeout Scope: SYSTEM Type: Time specification string; for example, \"1s\" or \"5m\" Default: \"0\" Sets the maximum time the agent should wait for the daemon to start after a daemon launch was triggered. A value of 0 causes the agent to not wait. Allowed units are \"ns\", \"us\", \"ms\", \"s\", \"m\" and \"h\". The specified timeout value will be passed to the daemon via the --wait-for-port flag. This causes daemon startup to block until a socket is acquired or until the timeout is elapsed. Recommendation: If setting a timeout, the recommended value is 2s to 5s. It is recommended to only set this timeout when instrumenting long-lived background tasks, as in case of daemon start problems the agent will block for the given timeout at every transaction start. Transaction tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Set this to a comma-separated list of user defined functions or methods to instrument: \"myfunction,myclass::method,otherfunction\" Copy Internal PHP functions cannot have custom tracing. You can add to the list of custom functions with each PERDIR file, but you cannot remove a function or method that has already been added. If you want to programmatically add functions or methods to be instrumented, use the newrelic_add_custom_tracer() API function call. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables the transaction tracer. The tracer creates a detailed transaction trace for transactions that take more time than the threshold, as set by the newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold value. Only one transaction trace per application per harvest cycle is stored and it is always the slowest transaction during that cycle. Transaction traces are useful for diagnosing why a particular transaction was slow. Unless memory and performance are critical, they should almost never be disabled. Enabling this does have a very slight performance impact and does use more memory. For more information, see newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables requesting explain plans from MySQLi and PDO MySQL libraries for slow query calls. Explain plans will only be available when newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql is set to true and newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is not set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.explain_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" Sets the threshold beyond which queries are considered \"slow\" and thus candidates for the Slow Queries page. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.internal_functions_enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: false Enables or disables support for tracing internal functions (that is, functions written in C and provided either via the PHP standard library or PECL extensions). When enabled, internal functions appear in transaction traces like functions written in PHP. Enabling this option may result in transactions being slower, especially when collecting many traces from PHP 5.x. Enabling this option is only recommended when specifically debugging performance issues where an internal function is suspected to be slow. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"obfuscated\" Sets how queries are recorded (if at all). When recording transaction traces internally, the full query for slow query calls is recorded. Sending this query to New Relic can have serious security implications, so by default, all database statements are obfuscated before being sent to New Relic. The obfuscation is not reversible, as it replaces strings and numbers in any query with question marks. The only things that survive intact are field names, not any of their values. If you are testing with data that is not sensitive and you need to see the raw queries in transaction traces, set this to \"raw\". If you do not want queries recorded at all, set this to \"off\". Important Always set this back to \"obfuscated\" or \"off\" in any production environment. newrelic.transaction_tracer.slow_sql Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable the Slow Queries feature. When enabled, it will: Record the top 10 slowest database queries per application per minute. Create a stack trace leading up to the query. If this variable is set to false or SQL recording is disabled, the New Relic agent does not gather any slow query data. newrelic.transaction_tracer.stack_trace_threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"500\" This sets the threshold above which the agent will record the full PHP stack for transaction traces for which queries are being recorded. Specify duration as an absolute value with units. Default unit is in milliseconds if none is specified. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" Stack traces can consume memory, so be careful of setting this value too low. This variable has no meaning if newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to \"off\". newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold Scope: PERDIR Type: Duration Default: \"apdex_f\" Use this variable to set the threshold beyond which transactions are eligible for being traced. Available values include: Use \"apdex_f\" to set the threshold to 4 times the application's apdex_t value. For more information, see Apdex: Measuring user satisfaction. Use any other duration string to set a specific time threshold. Specify the duration as an absolute value and the unit of measurement. If none is specified, the unit defaults to millisecond. Example durations \"200ms\" \"1s250ms\" \"1h30m\" \"750us\" newrelic.transaction_tracer.gather_input_queries Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Use this setting to enable or disable gathering of DQL input queries with Slow Queries and Transaction Traces. When enabled, these will appear along with slow queries and transaction traces. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 0 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for web transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP web processes; it will not effect PHP CLI processes. To set a limit for CLI processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli. newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_cli Scope: PERDIR Type: Number Default: 100000 Specifies the maximum number of segments the PHP agent shall record for CLI transactions. Once that maximum is reached sampling will occur. The PHP agent reports transaction traces and distributed traces as a collection of segments. Each segment represents a method or a function call in a transaction trace. The default value for this configuration is 0, indicating that the PHP agent shall capture all segments during a web transaction. At the end of a transaction, it assembles the highest priority segments to report in a transaction trace. For long-running PHP processes with hundreds of thousands or millions of function calls, setting this to a value greater than 1 prevents the PHP agent from exhausting system memory when recording segments. Segment size can vary based upon the length of the corresponding method's name, the length of its class name, and the number of subsequent calls made by the method. That said, a conservative estimate is 400 bytes per segment. To limit the PHP agent to 40 MB for segment capture, set this value to 100000. If this value is set lower than 2000, it further limits the total number of segments reported for transaction traces. This configuration setting is only for PHP CLI processes; it will not effect PHP web processes. To set a limit for web processes use newrelic.transaction_tracer.max_segments_web. Other tracer .ini settings The values of these settings are used to control various tracer features. newrelic.cross_application_tracer.enabled Important A distributed tracing feature is available. Distributed tracing improves on cross application tracing and is recommended for monitoring activity in complex distributed systems. Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the cross application tracer. The cross application tracer inserts HTTP headers into outbound requests and the response in order to link together web transaction metrics and transaction traces between applications. Distributed tracing and cross application tracing cannot be used simultaneously. The default configuration for the PHP agent disables distributed tracing and enables cross application tracing. newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Important Enabling distributed tracing disables cross-application tracing. Before enabling, read the transition guide to understand effects on New Relic features. Enable or disable distributed tracing. When the agent's transaction tracer and distributed tracing features are enabled, the agent will insert headers into outbound requests, and scan incoming requests for distributed tracing headers. newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to exclude the New Relic distributed tracing header that is attached to outbound requests, and to instead only rely on W3C Trace Context Headers for distributed tracing. If this is false then both types of headers are attached to outbound requests. The New Relic distributed tracing header allows interoperability with older agents that do not support W3C Trace Context headers. Agent versions that support W3C Trace Context headers will prioritize them over New Relic headers for distributed tracing. newrelic.span_events_enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Span events are reported for distributed tracing. Span event reporting requires distributed tracing to be enabled. This option enables/disables the reporting of span events. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: \"\" Configures the Trace Observer used for Infinite Tracing. If empty, Infinite Tracing support will be disabled. This requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.port Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer Default: 443 Configures the TCP/IP port used to communicate with the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. This setting is ignored if newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host is empty. This setting will not usually need to be changed. newrelic.infinite_tracing.span_events.queue_size Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer (1000 or higher) Default: 100000 Sets the number of span events that can be queued for transmission to the Infinite Tracing Trace Observer. The agent internally manages span events for Infinite Tracing in span batches. Those span batches can hold a maximum of 1000 spans. Therefore, the span events queue size cannot be lower than 1000, as otherwise not even a single span batch can be queued. If a queue size lower than 1000 is specified, the minimum size of 1000 is used. newrelic.error_collector.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the error collector. When enabled, the agent collects and reports PHP errors to the New Relic UI. The agent records only the single most severe error for each transaction, and up to 20 errors per harvest cycle. Tip For an overview of error configuration in APM, see Manage errors in APM. newrelic.error_collector.record_database_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When enabled, the agent collects errors returned by MySQL functions as if they were PHP errors. newrelic.error_collector.prioritize_api_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false Set this to true to assign the highest priority to errors identified through the newrelic_notice_error() API function. newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) A comma separated list of fully-qualified exception class names that the agent should ignore. When an unhandled exception occurs, the agent will perform the equivalent of $exception instanceof Class for each of the classes listed. If any of those checks returns true, the agent will not record an exception. Depending on the supported PHP release, these values are equivalent to disabling exception reporting: Supported PHP 5 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Exceptions Supported PHP 7 versions: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_exceptions = Throwable newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors Scope: PERDIR Type: Integer or a bitwise expression of PHP-defined error constants Default: 0 Sets the error levels for the PHP agent to ignore. The value for this setting uses similar syntax to PHP's error_reporting option. For example, to configure the PHP agent to ignore E_WARNING and E_ERROR level errors, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_WARNING | E_ERROR or newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = 3 To configure the PHP agent to ignore everything but E_WARNING, use: newrelic.error_collector.ignore_errors = E_ALL & ~E_WARNING newrelic.framework.drupal.modules Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: In agents prior to version 3.0 the default for this value was false. Setting this option implied newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail = 1. To enable Drupal module tracking, set this to true. This option has the same performance impact as newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail. It will enable the recording of Drupal module functions and call counts, and they will display under the Modules tab, much like web transactions. newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true To enable WordPress hook tracking, set this to true. It will enable the recording of WordPress hooks, plugins, and themes, and they will display under the WordPress tab in the New Relic UI. newrelic.webtransaction.name.files Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" This is the same as newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions, except it uses file names to name the web transaction. The file names can be standard POSIX regular expression to be used with PCRE; for example, \"controllers/actions/.*\". newrelic.webtransaction.name.functions Scope: PERDIR Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"\" Unless the New Relic agent detects a specific framework, such as Drupal or Wordpress, web transactions are named after the initial PHP file; for example, article.php. When the initial file is a dispatcher, this naming scheme produces less than useful data. Use this variable to specify a list of functions that are the \"actions\" generated by the dispatcher. The name of the web transaction will be the first action function executed. Example dispatch function naming If index.php dispatches to functions named: login, logout, admin, show, and edit You would set this value to \"login,logout,admin,show,edit\". The web transactions will be named login, logout, etc. instead of /index.php (the initial file name). newrelic.webtransaction.name.remove_trailing_path Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: false When enabled,this removes any content in the request URI after the script name. For example, this would remove the trailing /xyz/zy from /path/to/foo.php/xyz/zy. newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not report datastore instance metrics, nor add host or port_path_or_id parameters to transaction or slow sql traces. newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true If false, the agent will not add database_name parameter to transaction or slow sql traces. Attribute settings This section lists the settings that affect attribute collection and reporting. newrelic.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enable or disable the collection of attributes generated by the PHP agent or generated by the user through newrelic_add_custom_parameter(). This setting will take precedence over all other attribute configuration settings. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: True, except for browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Control which destinations receive attributes. These configuration settings will override the .include and .exclude settings. For more information on the destinations available, see Enabling and disabling attributes. newrelic.attributes.{include|exclude} Scope: PERDIR Type: String Default: (none) This is a family of configuration options that allow fine control over the destinations of attributes. For more information, see Enabling and disabling attributes. Other .ini settings This section lists the remaining newrelic.ini settings. newrelic.enabled Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: (none) Enable or disable the New Relic agent. By default the New Relic PHP agent is enabled for all directories. If you have multiple sites on your web server but only want the PHP agent to monitor specific ones: Make sure newrelic.enabled is set to true at the global (SYSTEM) level in your newrelic.ini file. Set newrelic.enabled to false for one or more specific sites on a per-directory basis (PERDIR). If you need to disable the agent globally, set the newrelic.enabled value to false in the newrelic.ini file. When the agent is globally disabled, it does not initialize completely. It assumes you are globally disabling it for a critical reason, and the agent will attempt to have as close to zero impact on PHP as possible. Important You cannot globally disable the agent and then selectively enable it on a per-directory basis by using .htaccess. newrelic.logfile Scope: SYSTEM Type: String (use quotes) Default: \"/var/log/newrelic/php_agent.log\" This identifies the file name for logging messages. This is useful for debugging any issues with the agent. Whatever you set this to, ensure that: The permissions for the containing directory and the file itself are correct. The user that PHP runs as can write to the file. Usually this is the same user as the web server. newrelic.transaction_events.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report analytics event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show additional information such as histograms and percentiles. newrelic.error_collector.capture_events Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true When set to true, the agent will collect and report error event data. Event data allows the New Relic UI to show Error analytics. newrelic.feature_flag Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This setting enables new and experimental features within the PHP agent. These flags are used to selectively enable features that are intended to be enabled by default in later versions of the PHP agent. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true This enables auto-insertion of the JavaScript fragments for browser monitoring. When enabled will cause the agent to insert a header and a footer in HTML output that will generate metrics on page load timing for the end-user experience. For more information, see Page load timing in PHP. newrelic.guzzle.enabled Scope: PERDIR Type: Boolean Default: true Enables or disables support for the Guzzle library when used with New Relic. PHP agent version 6.4 or higher: This setting is set to true by default. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection Scope: SYSTEM Type: Boolean Default: true Notes: Introduced in PHP agent version 9.4 Enables the detection of frameworks and libraries when preloading is enabled. Preloading was introduced in PHP version 7.4. newrelic.preload_framework_library_detection will only take effect when opcache.preload is set in the php.ini file.

      "body": "Most PHP agent configuration variables can be set on a per-directory basis. This option is often used when there is a single web server serving multiple applications, and you want to adjust settings (for example, the app name) on an application-by-application basis. The process for setting per-directory values depends on the environment. This document describes the three most common environments: Apache PHP-FPM NGINX For other app naming options, see Name your PHP application. Another option: API calls If you are trying to change the name the application reports as, you can use the newrelic_set_appname() API call instead of per-directory settings. For other settings that you can modify with the API, see PHP agent API. If you do not have access to the code for your application, or if you need to isolate your applications to their own virtual hosts for other reasons, then use the following per-directory settings to override any configuration file settings. Apache per-directory settings for PHP When using the PHP module, Apache provides two mechanisms for setting PHP variables outside the INI file: Edit the httpd.conf file or one of the files it includes. Use the syntax from the INI file examples when your web server serves up multiple domains. To view each of these domains separately in New Relic: For your main domain, set newrelic.appname = \"My Main Domain\" in your global INI file. Override the value for each of the virtual hosts by adding php_value entries as part of your virtual host configuration. Important Ensure you use the proper module name for your PHP install. Replace PHP_MODULE in the examples below with the name of the installed PHP5 module. This name depends on the Linux and/or PHP distribution being used. For example, common names include php5_module, mod_php5, php_module, etc. Capitalization may vary. For Apache servers, you can find the module names in one of the following ways. Each will generate a list of installed modules. From the command line, run: apachectl -t -D DUMP_MODULES Copy OR From within a webpage, use: <?php print_r(apache_get_modules()); ?> Copy Setting appname by domain Here is an example of separating domains, where PHP_MODULE is the name of your PHP5 module. <VirtualHost 192.168.42.43> ServerName www.myvhost1.com DocumentRoot \"/path/to/vhost1/\" ... <IfModule PHP_MODULE> php_value newrelic.appname \"Virtual Host 1\" </IfModule> </VirtualHost> <VirtualHost 192.168.123.45> ServerName www.myvhost2.com DocumentRoot \"/path/to/vhost2/\" ... <IfModule PHP_MODULE> php_value newrelic.appname \"Virtual Host 2\" </IfModule> </VirtualHost> Copy In the above example, newrelic.appname is set to a different value for each virtual host. For string and number values, use php_value name VALUE, where: name is the name of the INI setting to modify as listed in the PHP INI settings. VALUE is the value you want to set to for that particular virtual host. Be sure to surround string values in quotes marks \". If you want to change a boolean setting, use the syntax php_flag name VALUE, where name is the variable name as listed in the PHP INI settings, and VALUE is either on or off. To disable the New Relic agent completely for a virtual host, use a boolean flag: <VirtualHost 192.168.56.78> ServerName www.myvhost3.com DocumentRoot \"/path/to/vhost3/\" ... <IfModule PHP_MODULE> php_flag newrelic.enabled off </IfModule> </VirtualHost> Copy Edit the .htaccess file. Use the syntax from the INI file examples inside an .htaccess file. For example: php_value newrelic.appname \"My Blog App\" Copy This allows you to control settings on a per-directory basis from within the directories. In this example, your web server has its document root at /data/webroot. You also have two sub-directories for specialized applications: Your /data/webroot/blog contains a blog application. Your /data/webroot/shop contains a shopping cart application. To have all three portions of your site reported as distinct applications in the New Relic UI: Set the name of your main application in your INI file. Override that name using an .htaccess file in each of the specialized directories. Any part of your web server (for example, /data/webroot/something) that does not have a specific .htaccess file will use the global application name defined in the INI file. Important The .htaccess file must be in the top-level directory for that application. Objects in that directory, or its subdirectories, will use the value specified in the .htaccess file. For more information about using and securing .htaccess files, see the Apache HTTP server tutorial. PHP-FPM per-directory settings The FastCGI Process Manager (PHP-FPM) is dedicated to PHP. It spawns a number of worker processes that wait for requests. It increases performance by not re-initializing the PHP engine on each invocation, allowing each process to deal with a number of requests before it recycles. For more information on PHP-FPM, see PHP-FPM's about page and FastCGI Process Manager on php.net. When using PHP-FPM, there are two mechanisms for setting PHP variables outside the INI file and one special technique for NGINX: Edit the PHP-FPM pool per-directory settings Important Changing variables on a per-directory basis can be more difficult if you use PHP-FPM. You must use multiple PHP-FPM pools, one for each virtual host or unique application. A pool is a dedicated set of worker children that will only serve requests for that pool. Because it requires dedicated worker children, PHP-FPM scales poorly if you have a large number of virtual hosts or applications for which you want to set individual options. To configure PHP-FPM on a per-directory basis: Set the main application name in the INI file. Set up two pools for the two additional applications. Override the application name setting in those pools. Each pool has to have a unique connection mechanism (so you can identify which pool to use in your web server configuration file). Here is an example of php-fpm.conf: [app1] listen=/tmp/pool-app1.sock php_value[newrelic.appname] = \"My App 1\" [app2] listen=/tmp/pool-app2.sock php_value[newrelic.appname] = \"My App 2\" [app3] listen=/tmp/pool-app3.sock php_flag[newrelic.enabled] = off Copy The general format of the per-pool variable settings is php_value[name] = VALUE for string or numeric variables, or php_flag[name] = VALUE for boolean values. Always surround string values with quote marks \". Boolean values must be either on or off. Once the configuration file is set up, the web server must be instructed to use the different pools for different parts of the website. For more information, refer to the documentation for your web server. Create a .user.ini file. You can use the syntax from the INI file example for CGI/FastCGI in a .user.ini file. This is similar to a .htaccess file for Apache but is unique to PHP-FPM. The directory that PHP is executed in is scanned for a .user.ini file. More information about this feature is available in the PHP user.ini files documentation. Change the name of the app using the following steps In the root directory of the web page. Create the .user.ini file Add the setting you wish to change newrelic.appname = \"New Appname\" Save the file. By default, the .user.ini file is read every five minutes so no restart is necessary This is useful in the following scenarios: The server config doesn't work. In NGINX/PHP-FPM setup, there can be a lack of communication between FastCGI and PHP and the information from fastcgi_param PHP_VALUE newrelic.appname=\"Appname\" never reaches PHP. The .htaccess doesn't work, such as where PHP is implemented with suPHP Edit the NGINX config file. Important This section applies only to PHP 5.3.3 or higher. Here is a small fragment of an NGINX config file showing the general procedure to pass values to your FastCGI manager based on an NGINX location. location /blog { fastcgi_param PHP_VALUE \"newrelic.appname=My Blog\"; ... } location /shop { fastcgi_param PHP_VALUE \"newrelic.appname=Shopping Cart\"; ... } location /admin{ fastcgi_param PHP_VALUE \"newrelic.enabled=false\"; ... } Copy Tip A better approach for NGINX may be to use API calls. The following code snippet (for PHP agent 2.7 or higher) is an example. if (extension_loaded ('newrelic')) { newrelic_set_appname (\"My App 1\"); } Copy Roll-up application names If you want to have an overall view of how the server is performing across all virtual hosts or all applications, it is convenient to be able to report to more than one application at a time. For example, report to a virtual host specific application as well as a roll-up application. To do this, set more than one application name for the newrelic.appname parameter by separating each application name with a semicolon. The primary application name is first, and the secondary application names next. You can define up to two extra application names. For example: newrelic.appname=\"Virtual Host 1;All Virtual Hosts\" Copy This will report to two New Relic applications: \"Virtual Host 1\" and \"All Virtual Hosts\". Important This feature is only available in versions 2.4 or higher of the PHP agent.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent supports distributed tracing (including W3C Trace Context, as of PHP Agent version 9.8), which lets you see the path that requests take as they travel through a distributed system. This document contains PHP-specific tips to enable distributed tracing for a PHP application or service. Enable distributed tracing for PHP Important When distributed tracing is enabled, it implicitly disables cross application tracing. The PHP agent will ignore the cross application tracing configuration value, and act as though this value is set to false. To enable or disable distributed tracing for the PHP agent: If applicable, update your PHP agent to support distributed tracing (version 8.4 or higher, although we recommend version 9.8 or higher for the most complete functionality). Make sure that the transaction tracer configuration option is enabled (default is true): newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true Copy Enable (or disable) distributed tracing for the PHP agent with the distributed_tracing_enabled configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy Set the transaction tracer threshold value to a suitable value. Recommendation: If you want to make all transactions eligible for a distributed trace, set this value to 0 seconds. If you are only interested in traces for longer running transactions, or if generating a trace for every transaction creates unacceptable application performance, set this value higher than 0 seconds. For example: newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold = 0 Copy Optionally, if only W3C Trace Context tracing is desired, the New Relic Distributed Tracing headers can be disabled with the newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header = 1 Enable spans with the configuration setting: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true Be sure to restart your web server (or other PHP SAPI) so the agent will pick up the newly configured values. Enable Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing (PHP agent version 9.12 or later) extends distributed tracing to collect your span data in a trace observer, which runs in a cluster of services in AWS called New Relic Edge. The PHP agent sends all your spans to the trace observer so they can be assembled into traces for you to view in New Relic. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and configure the additional settings below: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host= \"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" Leverage automatic distributed tracing instrumentation The PHP agent automatically will instrument a number of native PHP functions, as well as some third party HTTP clients, with distributed trace information. These include: PHP function file_get_contents PHP functions curl_exec and curl_multi_exec Guzzle 4, Guzzle 5, Guzzle 6 Drupal's drupal_http_request function Laravel's queue jobs Set trace detail level Distributed tracing support depends on the PHP agent's transaction tracer. When distributed tracing is enabled, a span is created for each segment seen by the transaction tracer. As spans are sampled, the PHP agent will prioritize spans related to external calls above other spans, which are then recorded in descending order of their duration. If you find that there are too many unimportant spans being reported for PHP function calls, you can reduce the detail of the transaction tracer by setting newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail to 0. You may then use the newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom configuration setting or the newrelic_add_custom_tracer API method to add trace segments and spans for the specific PHP function or methods you want to add to your traces. Important For PHP agent versions 8.4 to 8.7: When distributed tracing is enabled, these versions behave as if newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail is set to 0 (as described above), which results in PHP function calls not generating spans. To get spans related to PHP function calls, update to version 9.0 or higher. Manually instrument applications and services Important W3C Trace Context support was added in version 9.8. With this, the API for manually instrumenting applications has changed from the JSON payload related functions newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload), to the header array forms newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers) and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers). The JSON functions are now considered deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. If you're using an unsupported library, or have a non-HTTP based distributed system component (such as messaging queues), you can use the PHP agent API to manually identify transactions to be included in a distributed trace. This is a two step process: Modify your service or application to create or insert the distributed tracing data Modify your service or application to accept distributed trace data created by other transactions or requests. The following example uses a generic message/job queue. While the actual details will vary depending on what sort of system you're trying to add to a distributed trace, the core concepts are the same. Also, while we've used a job queue as an example, you can use these methods with any distributed system component. Tip When you create a payload or insert headers, you're telling New Relic you want this request or transaction or request to participate in a distributed trace. When you accept them, you're linking the current request or transaction with its parent request or transaction. For more information about using manual instrumentation to get more detail or to see connections between services, see the documentation about distributed tracing APIs. Header API Insert distributed trace headers Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to insert distributed trace headers into an array by using newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers, and then add those headers to the job's data: $outbound_headers = array(); if (newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers)) { // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the headers to the job data $job->setData('nr_dt_headers', $outbound_headers); // save the job $job->save(); } else { echo \"Unable to obtain distributed tracing headers\"; } Copy Tip Tip: The headers created via newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() are HTTP safe. This is step one: You've inserted the distributed trace headers. Accept the distributed tracing headers Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept distributed trace headers, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $inbound_headers = $job->getData('nr_dt_headers'); if($inbound_headers) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers); } $job->run(); } Copy Payload API (deprecated) Create a distributed trace payload Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to create a distributed trace payload using newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload, and then add that payload to the job's data: $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the payload data to the job data as a text json string $job->setData('dt_payload', $payload->Text()); // save the job $job->save(); Copy This is step one: You've created a distributed trace payload. Accept the distributed tracing payload Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept a distributed trace payload, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $payload = $job->getData('dt_payload'); if($payload) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload); } $job->run(); } Copy Optional: Use HTTP safe payload strings If you need to transport the payload via a mechanism that requires HTTP safe strings, (HTTP headers, URL query strings, POST fields, etc.), the API includes distributed tracing methods and functions that will create and accept HTTP safe versions of the strings. // create the HTTP safe payload string $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); $httpSafePayload = $payload->httpSafe(); // ... // accept the HTTP safe payload string newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload_httpsafe($httpSafePayload); Copy Command line PHP programs PHP programs run from the PHP command line are always sampled by the agent's distributed tracer. Depending on the programs you run, these processes could see an over-representation in your collection of distributed traces. In these situations, you can opt to disable command line instrumentation by using the per-directory newrelic.enabled setting in your newrelic.ini files.

To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the PHP agent. To use browser monitoring with your PHP agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Use auto-instrumentation To configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with the browser monitoring script, add or edit the auto-instrumentation flag in your INI file. The PHP agent will automatically inject the browser monitoring's JS snippet into your pages. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument=1 Copy Auto-instrumentation does not work when the HTTP header field Content-Length is set. To use browser monitoring in this situation, disable auto-instrumentation and manually insert the JavaScript header and footer into your templates. Manually instrument via agent API To manually configure browser monitoring, include the appropriate scripts in your pages. The New Relic PHP agent has an API to automatically generate the required JavaScript header and footer in place. Important Calls to the PHP agent API are conditional on the newrelic extension being loaded so that the PHP agent is running. If the agent is not running, calls to generate the JavaScript header and footer will result in errors, as the functions will not be defined. For more information, see: auto_instrument agent settings newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer() Manually instrument for various frameworks This document does not provide detailed procedures to manually insert the Browser agent via the agent API. This is because there too many possible ways to construct a framework. The manual instrumentation examples show how to add instrumentation to frameworks that already support auto-instrumentation. If you are using another framework or modified versions of Drupal or WordPress, be sure to call the API functions for instrumentation at the right place. Insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() as part of the output page's <head> tag, preferably as the very first thing. As the very last thing before the closing </body> tag in the document, or as close to it as possible, insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(). Here are some basic examples.

If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the JavaScript (newrelic.js) is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. View Browser data Once you enable browser monitoring and generate traffic for your app, data will appear in your app's Browser Summary page. There is a short delay the first time you start the daemon (or when the PHP agent encounters a new application) while the daemon verifies the settings. After that, the New Relic JavaScript snippet is available. Disable auto-instrumentation For how to disable browser monitoring with the PHP agent config, see Browser monitoring config option.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent supports distributed tracing (including W3C Trace Context, as of PHP Agent version 9.8), which lets you see the path that requests take as they travel through a distributed system. This document contains PHP-specific tips to enable distributed tracing for a PHP application or service. Enable distributed tracing for PHP Important When distributed tracing is enabled, it implicitly disables cross application tracing. The PHP agent will ignore the cross application tracing configuration value, and act as though this value is set to false. To enable or disable distributed tracing for the PHP agent: If applicable, update your PHP agent to support distributed tracing (version 8.4 or higher, although we recommend version 9.8 or higher for the most complete functionality). Make sure that the transaction tracer configuration option is enabled (default is true): newrelic.transaction_tracer.enabled = true Copy Enable (or disable) distributed tracing for the PHP agent with the distributed_tracing_enabled configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_enabled = true Copy Set the transaction tracer threshold value to a suitable value. Recommendation: If you want to make all transactions eligible for a distributed trace, set this value to 0 seconds. If you are only interested in traces for longer running transactions, or if generating a trace for every transaction creates unacceptable application performance, set this value higher than 0 seconds. For example: newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold = 0 Copy Optionally, if only W3C Trace Context tracing is desired, the New Relic Distributed Tracing headers can be disabled with the newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header = 1 Enable spans with the configuration setting: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true Be sure to restart your web server (or other PHP SAPI) so the agent will pick up the newly configured values. Enable Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing (PHP agent version 9.12 or later) extends distributed tracing to collect your span data in a trace observer, which runs in a cluster of services in AWS called New Relic Edge. The PHP agent sends all your spans to the trace observer so they can be assembled into traces for you to view in New Relic. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and configure the additional settings below: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host= \"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" Leverage automatic distributed tracing instrumentation The PHP agent automatically will instrument a number of native PHP functions, as well as some third party HTTP clients, with distributed trace information. These include: PHP function file_get_contents PHP functions curl_exec and curl_multi_exec Guzzle 4, Guzzle 5, Guzzle 6 Drupal's drupal_http_request function Laravel's queue jobs Set trace detail level Distributed tracing support depends on the PHP agent's transaction tracer. When distributed tracing is enabled, a span is created for each segment seen by the transaction tracer. As spans are sampled, the PHP agent will prioritize spans related to external calls above other spans, which are then recorded in descending order of their duration. If you find that there are too many unimportant spans being reported for PHP function calls, you can reduce the detail of the transaction tracer by setting newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail to 0. You may then use the newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom configuration setting or the newrelic_add_custom_tracer API method to add trace segments and spans for the specific PHP function or methods you want to add to your traces. Important For PHP agent versions 8.4 to 8.7: When distributed tracing is enabled, these versions behave as if newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail is set to 0 (as described above), which results in PHP function calls not generating spans. To get spans related to PHP function calls, update to version 9.0 or higher. Manually instrument applications and services Important W3C Trace Context support was added in version 9.8. With this, the API for manually instrumenting applications has changed from the JSON payload related functions newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload), to the header array forms newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers) and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers). The JSON functions are now considered deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. If you're using an unsupported library, or have a non-HTTP based distributed system component (such as messaging queues), you can use the PHP agent API to manually identify transactions to be included in a distributed trace. This is a two step process: Modify your service or application to create or insert the distributed tracing data Modify your service or application to accept distributed trace data created by other transactions or requests. The following example uses a generic message/job queue. While the actual details will vary depending on what sort of system you're trying to add to a distributed trace, the core concepts are the same. Also, while we've used a job queue as an example, you can use these methods with any distributed system component. Tip When you create a payload or insert headers, you're telling New Relic you want this request or transaction or request to participate in a distributed trace. When you accept them, you're linking the current request or transaction with its parent request or transaction. For more information about using manual instrumentation to get more detail or to see connections between services, see the documentation about distributed tracing APIs. Header API Insert distributed trace headers Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to insert distributed trace headers into an array by using newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers, and then add those headers to the job's data: $outbound_headers = array(); if (newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers)) { // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the headers to the job data $job->setData('nr_dt_headers', $outbound_headers); // save the job $job->save(); } else { echo \"Unable to obtain distributed tracing headers\"; } Copy Tip Tip: The headers created via newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() are HTTP safe. This is step one: You've inserted the distributed trace headers. Accept the distributed tracing headers Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept distributed trace headers, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $inbound_headers = $job->getData('nr_dt_headers'); if($inbound_headers) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers); } $job->run(); } Copy Payload API (deprecated) Create a distributed trace payload Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to create a distributed trace payload using newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload, and then add that payload to the job's data: $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the payload data to the job data as a text json string $job->setData('dt_payload', $payload->Text()); // save the job $job->save(); Copy This is step one: You've created a distributed trace payload. Accept the distributed tracing payload Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept a distributed trace payload, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $payload = $job->getData('dt_payload'); if($payload) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload); } $job->run(); } Copy Optional: Use HTTP safe payload strings If you need to transport the payload via a mechanism that requires HTTP safe strings, (HTTP headers, URL query strings, POST fields, etc.), the API includes distributed tracing methods and functions that will create and accept HTTP safe versions of the strings. // create the HTTP safe payload string $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); $httpSafePayload = $payload->httpSafe(); // ... // accept the HTTP safe payload string newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload_httpsafe($httpSafePayload); Copy Command line PHP programs PHP programs run from the PHP command line are always sampled by the agent's distributed tracer. Depending on the programs you run, these processes could see an over-representation in your collection of distributed traces. In these situations, you can opt to disable command line instrumentation by using the per-directory newrelic.enabled setting in your newrelic.ini files.

To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the PHP agent. To use browser monitoring with your PHP agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Use auto-instrumentation To configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with the browser monitoring script, add or edit the auto-instrumentation flag in your INI file. The PHP agent will automatically inject the browser monitoring's JS snippet into your pages. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument=1 Copy Auto-instrumentation does not work when the HTTP header field Content-Length is set. To use browser monitoring in this situation, disable auto-instrumentation and manually insert the JavaScript header and footer into your templates. Manually instrument via agent API To manually configure browser monitoring, include the appropriate scripts in your pages. The New Relic PHP agent has an API to automatically generate the required JavaScript header and footer in place. Important Calls to the PHP agent API are conditional on the newrelic extension being loaded so that the PHP agent is running. If the agent is not running, calls to generate the JavaScript header and footer will result in errors, as the functions will not be defined. For more information, see: auto_instrument agent settings newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer() Manually instrument for various frameworks This document does not provide detailed procedures to manually insert the Browser agent via the agent API. This is because there too many possible ways to construct a framework. The manual instrumentation examples show how to add instrumentation to frameworks that already support auto-instrumentation. If you are using another framework or modified versions of Drupal or WordPress, be sure to call the API functions for instrumentation at the right place. Insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() as part of the output page's <head> tag, preferably as the very first thing. As the very last thing before the closing </body> tag in the document, or as close to it as possible, insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(). Here are some basic examples. WordPress This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a WordPress installation using the default twentyten theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/header.php. <body <?php body_class(); ?>> <div id=\"wrapper\" class=\"hfeed\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"masthead\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the end user monitoring footer in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/footer.php. ... </div><!-- #site-generator --> </div><!-- #colophon --> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> </div><!-- #footer --> Copy Drupal This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a Drupal installation using the default garland theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header right after the opening header tag in website home dir/drupal/themes/garland/page.tpl.php. <div id=\"container\" class=\"clear-block\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"logo-floater\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the footer right before the last closing layout tag: ... </div> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> <!-- /layout --> <?php print $closure ?> </body> </html> Copy Important In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the JavaScript (newrelic.js) is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. View Browser data Once you enable browser monitoring and generate traffic for your app, data will appear in your app's Browser Summary page. There is a short delay the first time you start the daemon (or when the PHP agent encounters a new application) while the daemon verifies the settings. After that, the New Relic JavaScript snippet is available. Disable auto-instrumentation For how to disable browser monitoring with the PHP agent config, see Browser monitoring config option. For how to use the API to disable browser monitoring, see newrelic_disable_autorum().

For example: newrelic.transaction_tracer.threshold = 0 Copy Optionally, if only W3C Trace Context tracing is desired, the New Relic Distributed Tracing headers can be disabled with the newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header configuration option: newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header = 1 Enable spans with the configuration setting: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true Be sure to restart your web server (or other PHP SAPI) so the agent will pick up the newly configured values. Enable Infinite Tracing Infinite Tracing (PHP agent version 9.12 or later) extends distributed tracing to collect your span data in a trace observer, which runs in a cluster of services in AWS called New Relic Edge. The PHP agent sends all your spans to the trace observer so they can be assembled into traces for you to view in New Relic. To turn on Infinite Tracing, enable distributed tracing and configure the additional settings below: newrelic.span_events_enabled = true newrelic.infinite_tracing.trace_observer.host= \"YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_HOST\" Leverage automatic distributed tracing instrumentation The PHP agent automatically will instrument a number of native PHP functions, as well as some third party HTTP clients, with distributed trace information. These include: PHP function file_get_contents PHP functions curl_exec and curl_multi_exec Guzzle 4, Guzzle 5, Guzzle 6 Drupal's drupal_http_request function Laravel's queue jobs Set trace detail level Distributed tracing support depends on the PHP agent's transaction tracer. When distributed tracing is enabled, a span is created for each segment seen by the transaction tracer. As spans are sampled, the PHP agent will prioritize spans related to external calls above other spans, which are then recorded in descending order of their duration. If you find that there are too many unimportant spans being reported for PHP function calls, you can reduce the detail of the transaction tracer by setting newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail to 0. You may then use the newrelic.transaction_tracer.custom configuration setting or the newrelic_add_custom_tracer API method to add trace segments and spans for the specific PHP function or methods you want to add to your traces. Important For PHP agent versions 8.4 to 8.7: When distributed tracing is enabled, these versions behave as if newrelic.transaction_tracer.detail is set to 0 (as described above), which results in PHP function calls not generating spans. To get spans related to PHP function calls, update to version 9.0 or higher. Manually instrument applications and services Important W3C Trace Context support was added in version 9.8. With this, the API for manually instrumenting applications has changed from the JSON payload related functions newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload), to the header array forms newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers) and newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers). The JSON functions are now considered deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. If you're using an unsupported library, or have a non-HTTP based distributed system component (such as messaging queues), you can use the PHP agent API to manually identify transactions to be included in a distributed trace. This is a two step process: Modify your service or application to create or insert the distributed tracing data Modify your service or application to accept distributed trace data created by other transactions or requests. The following example uses a generic message/job queue. While the actual details will vary depending on what sort of system you're trying to add to a distributed trace, the core concepts are the same. Also, while we've used a job queue as an example, you can use these methods with any distributed system component. Tip When you create a payload or insert headers, you're telling New Relic you want this request or transaction or request to participate in a distributed trace. When you accept them, you're linking the current request or transaction with its parent request or transaction. For more information about using manual instrumentation to get more detail or to see connections between services, see the documentation about distributed tracing APIs. Header API Insert distributed trace headers Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to insert distributed trace headers into an array by using newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers, and then add those headers to the job's data: $outbound_headers = array(); if (newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers)) { // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the headers to the job data $job->setData('nr_dt_headers', $outbound_headers); // save the job $job->save(); } else { echo \"Unable to obtain distributed tracing headers\"; } Copy Tip Tip: The headers created via newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() are HTTP safe. This is step one: You've inserted the distributed trace headers. Accept the distributed tracing headers Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept distributed trace headers, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $inbound_headers = $job->getData('nr_dt_headers'); if($inbound_headers) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers); } $job->run(); } Copy Payload API (deprecated) Create a distributed trace payload Somewhere in your application you'll have code that looks or acts like the following: // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // save the job $job->save(); Copy If you want this job to appear in a distributed trace, you need to create a distributed trace payload using newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload, and then add that payload to the job's data: $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); // create a job object $job = new \\Generic\\Queue\\Job; // set the information needed to run the queue job $job->setData('info', $info); // add the payload data to the job data as a text json string $job->setData('dt_payload', $payload->Text()); // save the job $job->save(); Copy This is step one: You've created a distributed trace payload. Accept the distributed tracing payload Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept a distributed trace payload, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $payload = $job->getData('dt_payload'); if($payload) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload); } $job->run(); } Copy Optional: Use HTTP safe payload strings If you need to transport the payload via a mechanism that requires HTTP safe strings, (HTTP headers, URL query strings, POST fields, etc.), the API includes distributed tracing methods and functions that will create and accept HTTP safe versions of the strings. // create the HTTP safe payload string $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); $httpSafePayload = $payload->httpSafe(); // ... // accept the HTTP safe payload string newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload_httpsafe($httpSafePayload); Copy Command line PHP programs PHP programs run from the PHP command line are always sampled by the agent's distributed tracer. Depending on the programs you run, these processes could see an over-representation in your collection of distributed traces. In these situations, you can opt to disable command line instrumentation by using the per-directory newrelic.enabled setting in your newrelic.ini files.

      "body": "With the PHP agent, you can add browser monitoring to your pages either automatically or manually. To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the PHP agent. To use browser monitoring with your PHP agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Use auto-instrumentation To configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with the browser monitoring script, add or edit the auto-instrumentation flag in your INI file. The PHP agent will automatically inject the browser monitoring's JS snippet into your pages. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument=1 Copy Auto-instrumentation does not work when the HTTP header field Content-Length is set. To use browser monitoring in this situation, disable auto-instrumentation and manually insert the JavaScript header and footer into your templates. Manually instrument via agent API To manually configure browser monitoring, include the appropriate scripts in your pages. The New Relic PHP agent has an API to automatically generate the required JavaScript header and footer in place. Important Calls to the PHP agent API are conditional on the newrelic extension being loaded so that the PHP agent is running. If the agent is not running, calls to generate the JavaScript header and footer will result in errors, as the functions will not be defined. For more information, see: auto_instrument agent settings newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer() Manually instrument for various frameworks This document does not provide detailed procedures to manually insert the Browser agent via the agent API. This is because there too many possible ways to construct a framework. The manual instrumentation examples show how to add instrumentation to frameworks that already support auto-instrumentation. If you are using another framework or modified versions of Drupal or WordPress, be sure to call the API functions for instrumentation at the right place. Insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() as part of the output page's <head> tag, preferably as the very first thing. As the very last thing before the closing </body> tag in the document, or as close to it as possible, insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(). Here are some basic examples. WordPress This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a WordPress installation using the default twentyten theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/header.php. <body <?php body_class(); ?>> <div id=\"wrapper\" class=\"hfeed\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"masthead\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the end user monitoring footer in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/footer.php. ... </div><!-- #site-generator --> </div><!-- #colophon --> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> </div><!-- #footer --> Copy Drupal This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a Drupal installation using the default garland theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header right after the opening header tag in website home dir/drupal/themes/garland/page.tpl.php. <div id=\"container\" class=\"clear-block\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"logo-floater\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the footer right before the last closing layout tag: ... </div> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> <!-- /layout --> <?php print $closure ?> </body> </html> Copy Important In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the JavaScript (newrelic.js) is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. View Browser data Once you enable browser monitoring and generate traffic for your app, data will appear in your app's Browser Summary page. There is a short delay the first time you start the daemon (or when the PHP agent encounters a new application) while the daemon verifies the settings. After that, the New Relic JavaScript snippet is available. Disable auto-instrumentation For how to disable browser monitoring with the PHP agent config, see Browser monitoring config option. For how to use the API to disable browser monitoring, see newrelic_disable_autorum().

Enable distributed tracing for PHP Important When distributed tracing is enabled, it implicitly disables cross application tracing. The PHP agent will ignore the cross application tracing configuration value, and act as though this value is set to false. To enable or disable distributed tracing for the PHP agent: If applicable, update your PHP agent to support distributed tracing (version 8.4 or higher, although we recommend version 9.8 or higher for the most complete functionality).

Accept the distributed tracing payload Next, somewhere in your application stack you'll have a queue runner that looks or acts like the following: // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; // grab jobs until there aren't any while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { // run the job $job->run(); } Copy In order to accept a distributed trace payload, use the newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload function // create the job runner $jobRunner = \\Generic\\Queue\\Runner; while($job = $jobRunner->next()) { $payload = $job->getData('dt_payload'); if($payload) { newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload); } $job->run(); } Copy Optional: Use HTTP safe payload strings If you need to transport the payload via a mechanism that requires HTTP safe strings, (HTTP headers, URL query strings, POST fields, etc.), the API includes distributed tracing methods and functions that will create and accept HTTP safe versions of the strings. // create the HTTP safe payload string $payload = newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload(); $httpSafePayload = $payload->httpSafe(); // ... // accept the HTTP safe payload string newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload_httpsafe($httpSafePayload); Copy Command line PHP programs PHP programs run from the PHP command line are always sampled by the agent's distributed tracer. Depending on the programs you run, these processes could see an over-representation in your collection of distributed traces. In these situations, you can opt to disable command line instrumentation by using the per-directory newrelic.enabled setting in your newrelic.ini files.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent includes support for automatic transaction naming for the Community and Enterprise editions of Magento 1 and 2. This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.

When these metrics are collected, a Drupal tab appears in the New Relic user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select a Drupal app).

It is enabled by default (in versions 3.0 or higher), and can be disabled with: newrelic.framework.drupal.modules = 0 Copy Though this setting uses the word \"modules,\" it controls the collection of all Drupal metrics: modules, views, and hooks. Metrics The PHP agent collects metrics for the following: Modules: Versions 2.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within each Drupal module. In versions 3.5 or higher, time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions module_invoke and module_invoke_all. In previous versions, time was calculated from functions from a file with the \".module\" extension where the file name and function prefix were a match. Hooks: Versions 3.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within each Drupal hook. Time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions module_invoke and module_invoke_all. Views: Versions 3.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within a view's view::execute method. Drupal and Browser instrumentation In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the New Relic Browser JavaScript is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. For more information, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Cron tasks Drupal supports periodically executing tasks to perform routine maintenance or similar work on behalf of installed Drupal modules. These tasks can be run without any manual involvement beyond the initial configuration. Commonly, these are referred to as cron tasks. Starting in version 4.3, the New Relic PHP agent detects the execution of these tasks and automatically marks them as background transactions regardless of how they were started.

Metrics The PHP agent collects metrics for the following: Modules: Versions 2.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within each Drupal module. In versions 3.5 or higher, time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions module_invoke and module_invoke_all. In previous versions, time was calculated from functions from a file with the \".module\" extension where the file name and function prefix were a match. Hooks: Versions 3.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within each Drupal hook. Time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions module_invoke and module_invoke_all. Views: Versions 3.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within a view's view::execute method. Drupal and Browser instrumentation In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the New Relic Browser JavaScript is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. For more information, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Cron tasks Drupal supports periodically executing tasks to perform routine maintenance or similar work on behalf of installed Drupal modules. These tasks can be run without any manual involvement beyond the initial configuration. Commonly, these are referred to as cron tasks. Starting in version 4.3, the New Relic PHP agent detects the execution of these tasks and automatically marks them as background transactions regardless of how they were started.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent includes support for automatic transaction naming for the Community and Enterprise editions of Magento 1 and 2. This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.

Metrics The PHP agent collects metrics for the following: Modules: Versions 2.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within each Drupal module. In versions 3.5 or higher, time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions module_invoke and module_invoke_all. In previous versions, time was calculated from functions from a file with the \".module\" extension where the file name and function prefix were a match. Hooks: Versions 3.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within each Drupal hook. Time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions module_invoke and module_invoke_all. Views: Versions 3.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within a view's view::execute method. Drupal and Browser instrumentation In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the New Relic Browser JavaScript is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. For more information, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Cron tasks Drupal supports periodically executing tasks to perform routine maintenance or similar work on behalf of installed Drupal modules. These tasks can be run without any manual involvement beyond the initial configuration. Commonly, these are referred to as cron tasks. Starting in version 4.3, the New Relic PHP agent detects the execution of these tasks and automatically marks them as background transactions regardless of how they were started.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent includes support for automatic transaction naming for the Community and Enterprise editions of Magento 1 and 2. This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent includes support for automatic transaction naming for the Community and Enterprise editions of Magento 1 and 2. This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.

The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP) For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "The PHP agent consists of two parts: The PHP extension module, newrelic.so The agent daemon, newrelic-daemon The daemon acts as a proxy between the PHP agent and the New Relic collector to reduce network traffic and to improve response time for instrumented applications. If the daemon is not running, no data is reported to New Relic. PHP daemon initial or idle states When the daemon is in an initial or idle state, two transactions must occur before it will start reporting. In an initial state: With the first transaction, the daemon adds your newly-reporting application to its own application information table. Once the application is added, the daemon reports the second transaction to New Relic. In an idle state: The first transaction wakes up the daemon and re-establishes the connection to New Relic. The second transaction reports data to New Relic. Watchdog and worker processes If you do a process listing, you will see that there are always two daemon processes running: $ ps -ef | grep newrelic-daemon newrelic 1368 1 0 00:28 ? 00:00:00 /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon ... newrelic 1370 1368 0 00:28 ? 00:00:00 /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon ... Copy Having two processes running is normal behavior. The first column is the process owner, the second is the process ID (PID), and the third is the parent process ID (PPID). Daemon processes Comments Watchdog (first process) The first process, the one owned by PID 1, is the \"watchdog\" process. It watches the second process, which is the \"worker\" process. Worker (second process) The worker process does the following: Accepts connections from the PHP agent Gathers metrics Communicates with the New Relic collector Terminating processes When the daemon is being gracefully terminated (usually by running /etc/init.d/newrelic-daemon stop), it will send a termination signal to the watchdog process. This will cleanly terminate the worker process and give it a chance to send any pending data to New Relic. Important If you need to manually terminate the daemon, always terminate the watchdog, not the worker. If the worker process encounters a fatal error and terminates unexpectedly, the watchdog process will immediately re-spawn a new worker process. This helps to ensure that the daemon experiences absolute minimum downtime. Stop the daemon The following methods can be used to kill the daemon: Recommended process: Use /etc/init.d/newrelic-daemon stop. This is the preferred method for interacting with the daemon. Kill the process directly with its process ID: kill 1368 Copy Use the watchdog PID file: kill `cat /var/run/newrelic-daemon.pid` Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "The PHP agent consists of two parts: The PHP extension module, newrelic.so The agent daemon, newrelic-daemon The daemon acts as a proxy between the PHP agent and the New Relic collector to reduce network traffic and to improve response time for instrumented applications. If the daemon is not running, no data is reported to New Relic. PHP daemon initial or idle states When the daemon is in an initial or idle state, two transactions must occur before it will start reporting. In an initial state: With the first transaction, the daemon adds your newly-reporting application to its own application information table. Once the application is added, the daemon reports the second transaction to New Relic. In an idle state: The first transaction wakes up the daemon and re-establishes the connection to New Relic. The second transaction reports data to New Relic. Watchdog and worker processes If you do a process listing, you will see that there are always two daemon processes running: $ ps -ef | grep newrelic-daemon newrelic 1368 1 0 00:28 ? 00:00:00 /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon ... newrelic 1370 1368 0 00:28 ? 00:00:00 /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon ... Copy Having two processes running is normal behavior. The first column is the process owner, the second is the process ID (PID), and the third is the parent process ID (PPID). Daemon processes Comments Watchdog (first process) The first process, the one owned by PID 1, is the \"watchdog\" process. It watches the second process, which is the \"worker\" process. Worker (second process) The worker process does the following: Accepts connections from the PHP agent Gathers metrics Communicates with the New Relic collector Terminating processes When the daemon is being gracefully terminated (usually by running /etc/init.d/newrelic-daemon stop), it will send a termination signal to the watchdog process. This will cleanly terminate the worker process and give it a chance to send any pending data to New Relic. Important If you need to manually terminate the daemon, always terminate the watchdog, not the worker. If the worker process encounters a fatal error and terminates unexpectedly, the watchdog process will immediately re-spawn a new worker process. This helps to ensure that the daemon experiences absolute minimum downtime. Stop the daemon The following methods can be used to kill the daemon: Recommended process: Use /etc/init.d/newrelic-daemon stop. This is the preferred method for interacting with the daemon. Kill the process directly with its process ID: kill 1368 Copy Use the watchdog PID file: kill `cat /var/run/newrelic-daemon.pid` Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Insights custom events API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Insights custom events API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw.

Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions.

      "body": "The PHP agent consists of two parts: The PHP extension module, newrelic.so The agent daemon, newrelic-daemon The daemon acts as a proxy between the PHP agent and the New Relic collector to reduce network traffic and to improve response time for instrumented applications. If the daemon is not running, no data is reported to New Relic. PHP daemon initial or idle states When the daemon is in an initial or idle state, two transactions must occur before it will start reporting. In an initial state: With the first transaction, the daemon adds your newly-reporting application to its own application information table. Once the application is added, the daemon reports the second transaction to New Relic. In an idle state: The first transaction wakes up the daemon and re-establishes the connection to New Relic. The second transaction reports data to New Relic. Watchdog and worker processes If you do a process listing, you will see that there are always two daemon processes running: $ ps -ef | grep newrelic-daemon newrelic 1368 1 0 00:28 ? 00:00:00 /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon ... newrelic 1370 1368 0 00:28 ? 00:00:00 /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon ... Copy Having two processes running is normal behavior. The first column is the process owner, the second is the process ID (PID), and the third is the parent process ID (PPID). Daemon processes Comments Watchdog (first process) The first process, the one owned by PID 1, is the \"watchdog\" process. It watches the second process, which is the \"worker\" process. Worker (second process) The worker process does the following: Accepts connections from the PHP agent Gathers metrics Communicates with the New Relic collector Terminating processes When the daemon is being gracefully terminated (usually by running /etc/init.d/newrelic-daemon stop), it will send a termination signal to the watchdog process. This will cleanly terminate the worker process and give it a chance to send any pending data to New Relic. Important If you need to manually terminate the daemon, always terminate the watchdog, not the worker. If the worker process encounters a fatal error and terminates unexpectedly, the watchdog process will immediately re-spawn a new worker process. This helps to ensure that the daemon experiences absolute minimum downtime. Stop the daemon The following methods can be used to kill the daemon: Recommended process: Use /etc/init.d/newrelic-daemon stop. This is the preferred method for interacting with the daemon. Kill the process directly with its process ID: kill 1368 Copy Use the watchdog PID file: kill `cat /var/run/newrelic-daemon.pid` Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

View or change server-side configuration settings Tip Owner, Admins, or Add-on Managers If you use server-side configuration, you must still include your license_key and app_name in the local config file. These settings are required for the agent to communicate with the New Relic collector. The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To view or change the available server-side configuration settings through the UI for apps that use other New Relic agents: Go to rpm.newrelic.com/apm > (select an app) > Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. OR Go to rpm.newrelic.com/apm. Next, from the index of applications, select the app's gear icon, then select View settings > Server-side agent configuration. View or change the available configuration settings for your agent. If you make changes, select Save server-side configuration. Once you set any of these options from the UI, they will override any conflicting options in the agent's configuration file. Disable server-side configuration Once you enable server-side configuration for an account, server-side configuration cannot be turned off without assistance from New Relic Support. This helps mitigate issues that could arise from conflicts with configuration settings if you need to transition back to a local configuration setup.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements. PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 5.5 or higher (except 5.6) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. Debian 5.0 (\"lenny\") or higher Ubuntu 9.10 (\"Karmic Koala\") or higher Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 1.2, 1.3, and 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Silex 1.x and 2.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, 2.x, and 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 1.x, 2.x, 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis.

You can use our launcher, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic PHP agent installation.

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Add PHP data PHP components Our PHP agent consists of two basic components: A PHP extension, which collects data from your application A local proxy daemon, which transmits the data to New Relic Your system's configuration components, including the web server, operating system, system permissions, PHP installation itself, package manager, etc., are all important factors during installation and configuration, because the agent is a part of that. For more information about supported PHP releases, frameworks, and other system requirements, see PHP compatibility and requirements. Install the agent Follow this general process to install the agent on your system. The agent installation package or tar archive includes the interactive newrelic-install script, which automates some installation tasks. Tip If your application is frequently inactive, we recommend you generate some data by interacting with the application or site. This will help ensure the agent initially connects. Ensure your system meets the agent's requirements, including appropriate system permissions. If you do not already have a New Relic account, create one. From your Account settings, copy your license key information. Install the agent package or tar archive on your system. RedHat or CentOS The most common way to install the agent on RedHat or CentOS is with the installation package (.rpm) and the package manager. You can tell the package manager to get it from the New Relic repository, or you can download the .rpm file directly from the New Relic website. Install the package with your preferred package manager (yum or rpm) and then run the newrelic-install script. Ubuntu or Debian Install the package either with apt-get or with dpkg commands. Typically, running the newrelic-install script is not required. Tar archive The .tar archive method is the most generic method you can use on all supported operating systems. Download the compressed tar archive for your system if any of these situations apply to you: Your operating system is not listed here. You are not using a package manager. Other methods are unsuccessful. Install the tar archive of the agent on any supported platform. Change the default application name to a meaningful name. Optional: Change other agent configuration settings to further customize your installation. Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.). Recommendation: To help ensure the PHP agent is initiated, especially if your application has infrequent activity, generate some data by using the app for a few seconds. Wait a few minutes for your application to send data to New Relic. Then, check your app's performance in the New Relic UI. Install PHP with partnership accounts Installation procedures may be different for admins who install the PHP agent through a New Relic partnership. For more information, see: AWS Heroku Magento Shared hosting providers Other partnership installation procedures Not all partners support PHP agents.

Other methods are unsuccessful. Install the tar archive of the agent on any supported platform. Change the default application name to a meaningful name. Optional: Change other agent configuration settings to further customize your installation. Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.). Recommendation: To help ensure the PHP agent is initiated, especially if your application has infrequent activity, generate some data by using the app for a few seconds. Wait a few minutes for your application to send data to New Relic. Then, check your app's performance in the New Relic UI. Install PHP with partnership accounts Installation procedures may be different for admins who install the PHP agent through a New Relic partnership. For more information, see: AWS Heroku Magento Shared hosting providers Other partnership installation procedures Not all partners support PHP agents.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements. PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 5.5 or higher (except 5.6) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. Debian 5.0 (\"lenny\") or higher Ubuntu 9.10 (\"Karmic Koala\") or higher Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 1.2, 1.3, and 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Silex 1.x and 2.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, 2.x, and 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 1.x, 2.x, 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

If necessary, contact your website developer/hosting provider for technical assistance. Shared hosting services In general, shared hosting providers (who do not provide root command line access) and hosting providers that do not have traditional operating systems (such as PaaS) do not allow users to install New Relic agents through typical channels. For example, these hosting providers do not support New Relic integrations for certain subscription levels: DreamHost: Shared Web Hosting WordPress.com hosted blog GoDaddy: Economy, Deluxe, Ultimate, WordPress Blog Hosting HostGator Web Hosting Before you install New Relic's PHP agent, make sure your hosting service level is compatible with New Relic. Also make sure you have administrator permissions for installation procedures from the command line at the root level. Installation and troubleshooting tips To help ensure that your application can integrate successfully with New Relic: Make sure your system meets New Relic's PHP compatibility requirements.

Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 5.5 or higher (except 5.6) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5.

For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 1.2, 1.3, and 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Silex 1.x and 2.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, 2.x, and 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 1.x, 2.x, 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8.

Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

If necessary, contact your website developer/hosting provider for technical assistance. Shared hosting services In general, shared hosting providers (who do not provide root command line access) and hosting providers that do not have traditional operating systems (such as PaaS) do not allow users to install New Relic agents through typical channels. For example, these hosting providers do not support New Relic integrations for certain subscription levels: DreamHost: Shared Web Hosting WordPress.com hosted blog GoDaddy: Economy, Deluxe, Ultimate, WordPress Blog Hosting HostGator Web Hosting Before you install New Relic's PHP agent, make sure your hosting service level is compatible with New Relic. Also make sure you have administrator permissions for installation procedures from the command line at the root level. Installation and troubleshooting tips To help ensure that your application can integrate successfully with New Relic: Make sure your system meets New Relic's PHP compatibility requirements. Important Windows operating systems are not supported. Follow New Relic's PHP installation procedures.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements. PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 5.5 or higher (except 5.6) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. Debian 5.0 (\"lenny\") or higher Ubuntu 9.10 (\"Karmic Koala\") or higher Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 1.2, 1.3, and 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Silex 1.x and 2.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, 2.x, and 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 1.x, 2.x, 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

It also, by default, inserts the New Relic Distributed Tracing header, but this can be disabled via the newrelic.distributed_tracing_exclude_newrelic_header INI setting. Parameters Parameter Description $headers array Required. An (optionally empty) array of outbound headers. This argument is passed by reference, and therefore must be a variable as opposed to a literal. Return values True if any headers were successfully inserted into the provided array, otherwise returns False Examples For examples of how and when to use this API method, see the documentation to manually instrument applications and services.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements. PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 5.5 or higher (except 5.6) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. Debian 5.0 (\"lenny\") or higher Ubuntu 9.10 (\"Karmic Koala\") or higher Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 1.2, 1.3, and 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Silex 1.x and 2.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, 2.x, and 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 1.x, 2.x, 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements. PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 5.5 or higher (except 5.6) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. Debian 5.0 (\"lenny\") or higher Ubuntu 9.10 (\"Karmic Koala\") or higher Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 1.2, 1.3, and 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Silex 1.x and 2.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, 2.x, and 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 1.x, 2.x, 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

Solution If no data appears after you generate traffic to your app and wait at least five minutes, use New Relic Diagnostics to automatically detect common problems and suggest troubleshooting. If that does not solve the problem, try the following: PHP agent troubleshooting Comments Compatibility Make sure your system meets the PHP agent's compatibility and requirements. Non-standard PHP version If you are using a non-standard version of PHP, follow the advanced installation procedures to make sure the default installer can find your version of PHP. App name Make sure your apps have a descriptive, unique name. For example, if you have multiple apps with the same name, such as the default app name PHP Application, data from each of these apps rolls up into the default app name, and it may appear as if an individual app is not reporting. Web server Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.), and wait a few minutes for data to appear. phpinfo() Check phpinfo() to verify that you installed the PHP agent and that the license key in it is correct. SELinux If your system uses SELinux, configure SELinux to work with the PHP agent. Log files Verify that both the agent and the daemon are writing to their log files. If not, reinstall the agent. Verify the log file permissions to make sure the log owner is the same as the New Relic user. PHP agent permissions Make sure you have the correct permissions to use the PHP agent. Other If none of these solutions solve the problem, see the troubleshooting procedures for: Agent stops after you update PHP After previously reporting data, the PHP agent stops reporting For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Solution If no data appears after you generate traffic to your app and wait at least five minutes, use New Relic Diagnostics to automatically detect common problems and suggest troubleshooting. If that does not solve the problem, try the following: PHP agent troubleshooting Comments Compatibility Make sure your system meets the PHP agent's compatibility and requirements. Non-standard PHP version If you are using a non-standard version of PHP, follow the advanced installation procedures to make sure the default installer can find your version of PHP. App name Make sure your apps have a descriptive, unique name. For example, if you have multiple apps with the same name, such as the default app name PHP Application, data from each of these apps rolls up into the default app name, and it may appear as if an individual app is not reporting. Web server Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.), and wait a few minutes for data to appear. phpinfo() Check phpinfo() to verify that you installed the PHP agent and that the license key in it is correct. SELinux If your system uses SELinux, configure SELinux to work with the PHP agent. Log files Verify that both the agent and the daemon are writing to their log files. If not, reinstall the agent. Verify the log file permissions to make sure the log owner is the same as the New Relic user. PHP agent permissions Make sure you have the correct permissions to use the PHP agent.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements. PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 5.5 or higher (except 5.6) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. Debian 5.0 (\"lenny\") or higher Ubuntu 9.10 (\"Karmic Koala\") or higher Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 1.2, 1.3, and 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Silex 1.x and 2.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, 2.x, and 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 1.x, 2.x, 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements. PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 5.5 or higher (except 5.6) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. Debian 5.0 (\"lenny\") or higher Ubuntu 9.10 (\"Karmic Koala\") or higher Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 1.2, 1.3, and 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Silex 1.x and 2.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, 2.x, and 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 1.x, 2.x, 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

Solution If no data appears after you generate traffic to your app and wait at least five minutes, use New Relic Diagnostics to automatically detect common problems and suggest troubleshooting. If that does not solve the problem, try the following: PHP agent troubleshooting Comments Compatibility Make sure your system meets the PHP agent's compatibility and requirements. Non-standard PHP version If you are using a non-standard version of PHP, follow the advanced installation procedures to make sure the default installer can find your version of PHP. App name Make sure your apps have a descriptive, unique name. For example, if you have multiple apps with the same name, such as the default app name PHP Application, data from each of these apps rolls up into the default app name, and it may appear as if an individual app is not reporting. Web server Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.), and wait a few minutes for data to appear. phpinfo() Check phpinfo() to verify that you installed the PHP agent and that the license key in it is correct. SELinux If your system uses SELinux, configure SELinux to work with the PHP agent. Log files Verify that both the agent and the daemon are writing to their log files. If not, reinstall the agent. Verify the log file permissions to make sure the log owner is the same as the New Relic user. PHP agent permissions Make sure you have the correct permissions to use the PHP agent. Other If none of these solutions solve the problem, see the troubleshooting procedures for: Agent stops after you update PHP After previously reporting data, the PHP agent stops reporting For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "Problem After installing the New Relic PHP agent, generating some traffic, and waiting at least five minutes, no data appears in your New Relic UI. Solution If no data appears after you generate traffic to your app and wait at least five minutes, use New Relic Diagnostics to automatically detect common problems and suggest troubleshooting. If that does not solve the problem, try the following: PHP agent troubleshooting Comments Compatibility Make sure your system meets the PHP agent's compatibility and requirements. Non-standard PHP version If you are using a non-standard version of PHP, follow the advanced installation procedures to make sure the default installer can find your version of PHP. App name Make sure your apps have a descriptive, unique name. For example, if you have multiple apps with the same name, such as the default app name PHP Application, data from each of these apps rolls up into the default app name, and it may appear as if an individual app is not reporting. Web server Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.), and wait a few minutes for data to appear. phpinfo() Check phpinfo() to verify that you installed the PHP agent and that the license key in it is correct. SELinux If your system uses SELinux, configure SELinux to work with the PHP agent. Log files Verify that both the agent and the daemon are writing to their log files. If not, reinstall the agent. Verify the log file permissions to make sure the log owner is the same as the New Relic user. PHP agent permissions Make sure you have the correct permissions to use the PHP agent. Other If none of these solutions solve the problem, see the troubleshooting procedures for: Agent stops after you update PHP After previously reporting data, the PHP agent stops reporting For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements. PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 5.5 or higher (except 5.6) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. Debian 5.0 (\"lenny\") or higher Ubuntu 9.10 (\"Karmic Koala\") or higher Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 1.2, 1.3, and 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Silex 1.x and 2.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, 2.x, and 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 1.x, 2.x, 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

If that does not solve the problem, try the following: PHP agent troubleshooting Comments Compatibility Make sure your system meets the PHP agent's compatibility and requirements. Non-standard PHP version If you are using a non-standard version of PHP, follow the advanced installation procedures to make sure the default installer can find your version of PHP. App name Make sure your apps have a descriptive, unique name. For example, if you have multiple apps with the same name, such as the default app name PHP Application, data from each of these apps rolls up into the default app name, and it may appear as if an individual app is not reporting. Web server Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.), and wait a few minutes for data to appear. phpinfo() Check phpinfo() to verify that you installed the PHP agent and that the license key in it is correct. SELinux If your system uses SELinux, configure SELinux to work with the PHP agent. Log files Verify that both the agent and the daemon are writing to their log files. If not, reinstall the agent. Verify the log file permissions to make sure the log owner is the same as the New Relic user. PHP agent permissions Make sure you have the correct permissions to use the PHP agent.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements. PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 5.5 or higher (except 5.6) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. Debian 5.0 (\"lenny\") or higher Ubuntu 9.10 (\"Karmic Koala\") or higher Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 1.2, 1.3, and 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Silex 1.x and 2.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, 2.x, and 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 1.x, 2.x, 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements. PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 5.5 or higher (except 5.6) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. Debian 5.0 (\"lenny\") or higher Ubuntu 9.10 (\"Karmic Koala\") or higher Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 1.2, 1.3, and 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Silex 1.x and 2.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, 2.x, and 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 1.x, 2.x, 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

Solution If no data appears after you generate traffic to your app and wait at least five minutes, use New Relic Diagnostics to automatically detect common problems and suggest troubleshooting. If that does not solve the problem, try the following: PHP agent troubleshooting Comments Compatibility Make sure your system meets the PHP agent's compatibility and requirements. Non-standard PHP version If you are using a non-standard version of PHP, follow the advanced installation procedures to make sure the default installer can find your version of PHP. App name Make sure your apps have a descriptive, unique name. For example, if you have multiple apps with the same name, such as the default app name PHP Application, data from each of these apps rolls up into the default app name, and it may appear as if an individual app is not reporting. Web server Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.), and wait a few minutes for data to appear. phpinfo() Check phpinfo() to verify that you installed the PHP agent and that the license key in it is correct. SELinux If your system uses SELinux, configure SELinux to work with the PHP agent. Log files Verify that both the agent and the daemon are writing to their log files. If not, reinstall the agent. Verify the log file permissions to make sure the log owner is the same as the New Relic user. PHP agent permissions Make sure you have the correct permissions to use the PHP agent. Other If none of these solutions solve the problem, see the troubleshooting procedures for: Agent stops after you update PHP After previously reporting data, the PHP agent stops reporting For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Solution If no data appears after you generate traffic to your app and wait at least five minutes, use New Relic Diagnostics to automatically detect common problems and suggest troubleshooting. If that does not solve the problem, try the following: PHP agent troubleshooting Comments Compatibility Make sure your system meets the PHP agent's compatibility and requirements. Non-standard PHP version If you are using a non-standard version of PHP, follow the advanced installation procedures to make sure the default installer can find your version of PHP. App name Make sure your apps have a descriptive, unique name. For example, if you have multiple apps with the same name, such as the default app name PHP Application, data from each of these apps rolls up into the default app name, and it may appear as if an individual app is not reporting. Web server Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.), and wait a few minutes for data to appear. phpinfo() Check phpinfo() to verify that you installed the PHP agent and that the license key in it is correct. SELinux If your system uses SELinux, configure SELinux to work with the PHP agent. Log files Verify that both the agent and the daemon are writing to their log files. If not, reinstall the agent. Verify the log file permissions to make sure the log owner is the same as the New Relic user. PHP agent permissions Make sure you have the correct permissions to use the PHP agent.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements. PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 5.5 or higher (except 5.6) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. Debian 5.0 (\"lenny\") or higher Ubuntu 9.10 (\"Karmic Koala\") or higher Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 1.2, 1.3, and 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Silex 1.x and 2.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, 2.x, and 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 1.x, 2.x, 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements. PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 5.5 or higher (except 5.6) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. Debian 5.0 (\"lenny\") or higher Ubuntu 9.10 (\"Karmic Koala\") or higher Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 1.2, 1.3, and 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Silex 1.x and 2.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, 2.x, and 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 1.x, 2.x, 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

If that does not solve the problem, try the following: PHP agent troubleshooting Comments Compatibility Make sure your system meets the PHP agent's compatibility and requirements. Non-standard PHP version If you are using a non-standard version of PHP, follow the advanced installation procedures to make sure the default installer can find your version of PHP. App name Make sure your apps have a descriptive, unique name. For example, if you have multiple apps with the same name, such as the default app name PHP Application, data from each of these apps rolls up into the default app name, and it may appear as if an individual app is not reporting. Web server Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.), and wait a few minutes for data to appear. phpinfo() Check phpinfo() to verify that you installed the PHP agent and that the license key in it is correct. SELinux If your system uses SELinux, configure SELinux to work with the PHP agent. Log files Verify that both the agent and the daemon are writing to their log files. If not, reinstall the agent.

If that does not solve the problem, try the following: PHP agent troubleshooting Comments Compatibility Make sure your system meets the PHP agent's compatibility and requirements. Non-standard PHP version If you are using a non-standard version of PHP, follow the advanced installation procedures to make sure the default installer can find your version of PHP. App name Make sure your apps have a descriptive, unique name. For example, if you have multiple apps with the same name, such as the default app name PHP Application, data from each of these apps rolls up into the default app name, and it may appear as if an individual app is not reporting. Web server Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.), and wait a few minutes for data to appear. phpinfo() Check phpinfo() to verify that you installed the PHP agent and that the license key in it is correct. SELinux If your system uses SELinux, configure SELinux to work with the PHP agent. Log files Verify that both the agent and the daemon are writing to their log files. If not, reinstall the agent. Verify the log file permissions to make sure the log owner is the same as the New Relic user. PHP agent permissions Make sure you have the correct permissions to use the PHP agent.

Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 5.5 or higher (except 5.6) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. Debian 5.0 (\"lenny\") or higher Ubuntu 9.10 (\"Karmic Koala\") or higher Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 1.2, 1.3, and 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Silex 1.x and 2.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, 2.x, and 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 1.x, 2.x, 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 1.2, 1.3, and 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Silex 1.x and 2.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, 2.x, and 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 1.x, 2.x, 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

Solution If no data appears after you generate traffic to your app and wait at least five minutes, use New Relic Diagnostics to automatically detect common problems and suggest troubleshooting. If that does not solve the problem, try the following: PHP agent troubleshooting Comments Compatibility Make sure your system meets the PHP agent's compatibility and requirements. Non-standard PHP version If you are using a non-standard version of PHP, follow the advanced installation procedures to make sure the default installer can find your version of PHP. App name Make sure your apps have a descriptive, unique name. For example, if you have multiple apps with the same name, such as the default app name PHP Application, data from each of these apps rolls up into the default app name, and it may appear as if an individual app is not reporting. Web server Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.), and wait a few minutes for data to appear. phpinfo() Check phpinfo() to verify that you installed the PHP agent and that the license key in it is correct. SELinux If your system uses SELinux, configure SELinux to work with the PHP agent. Log files Verify that both the agent and the daemon are writing to their log files. If not, reinstall the agent. Verify the log file permissions to make sure the log owner is the same as the New Relic user. PHP agent permissions Make sure you have the correct permissions to use the PHP agent.

Report an error the agent does not report automatically See newrelic_notice_error(). Ignore an error Edit error_collector.ignore_exceptions or error_collector.ignore_errors in thenewrelic.ini file. Enhance the metadata of a transaction Sometimes the code you target is visible in New Relic, but some details of the method are not useful. For example: The default name is not helpful, or it is causing a metric grouping issue. You want to add custom attributes to your transactions or spans so you can filter them with NRQL queries. Use these methods when you want to change how New Relic instruments a transaction that's already visible in New Relic: If you want to... Do this... Change the name of a transaction See newrelic_name_transaction(). Add metadata (such as your customer's account name or subscription level) to your transactions or spans Use custom attributes. For custom attributes which will be added to transactions and spans (if enabled), see newrelic_add_custom_parameter(). For custom attributes which will be added only to spans, see newrelic_add_custom_span_parameter(). Mark a transaction as a background job See newrelic_background_job(). Prevent a transaction from affecting your Apdex score See newrelic_ignore_apdex(). Name reporting app The New Relic UI organizes data by how you name your application. Each name appears as a different app. You can rename the reporting app for any part of your code to better help you: Organize and analyze your data on New Relic UI pages (for example, APM's Applications index page, the Summary page, the Transactions page, etc.). Query your data. Create alert policies. This is especially useful if you have a multi-site application or distinct sets of application code using the same PHP installation. Alternatively, you can set the app name at a higher level instead via the newrelic.appname config value, via Apache, or via PHP-FPM. If you want to... Do this... Rename the reporting app for a specific part of your code Set the app name. See newrelic_set_appname(). Instrument missing sections of your code with transactions To instrument your app, New Relic separates each path through your code into its own transaction. New Relic times (or \"instruments\") the parent method in these transactions to measure your app's overall performance, and collects transaction traces from long-running transactions for additional detail. For more information about transactions, see transaction and transaction trace. Use these methods when New Relic is not instrumenting a particular part of your code at all: If you want to... Do this... Start timing a method New Relic is not instrumenting automatically Start a transaction. See newrelic_start_transaction(). Stop timing a method after its work is completed Stop a transaction. See newrelic_end_transaction(). Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic Ignore the transaction. See newrelic_ignore_transaction(). Time specific methods using segments If a transaction is already visible in the New Relic UI, but you don't have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments to time those individual methods in greater detail. For example, you might want to time a particularly critical method with complex logic. Use this methods when you want to instrument a method within an existing transaction: If you want to... Do this... Time a particular method See newrelic_add_custom_tracer(). Instrument asynchronous work The only async work the PHP agent instruments is Guzzle, which is instrumented by default. Send custom event and metric data from your app New Relic includes a number of ways to record arbitrary custom data. For an explanation of New Relic data types, see Data collection. If you want to... Do this... Send data about an event so you can analyze it in New Relic Create a custom event. See Insert custom events via APM agent (PHP). Tag your events with metadata to filter and facet them Add custom attributes. See newrelic_add_custom_parameter(). Report custom performance data Create a custom metric. See newrelic_custom_metric(). Instrument calls to external services Use these methods to collect data about your app's connections to other apps or datastores: If you want to... Do this... Time a call to a datastore not instrumented by default See newrelic_record_datastore_segment(). See the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system For PHP agent versions lower than 9.8, see these API calls: newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload() newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload() newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload_httpsafe() For PHP agent versions 9.8 or higher, see these API calls: newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers() newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers() For examples, see the documentation to manually instrument distributed tracing. Monitor specific browser pages You can install the browser agent by automatically adding it to your pages or by deploying it on specific pages by copying and pasting our JavaScript snippet. You can also control the browser agent by using APM agent API calls. For more information, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent.

      "body": "New Relic offers several tools to help obtain the information needed to provide useful metrics about your Node.js application. These include: Reading the route names (if used) from the Express and Restify routers Using the API to name the current request, either with simple names or groups of controllers with actions Support rules that are stored in your agent's configuration that can mark requests to be renamed or ignored based on regular expressions matched against the request's raw URLs (also available as API calls) The number of names that New Relic tracks needs to be small enough so that the user experience is robust. It also needs to be large enough to provide the right amount of information (without overwhelming you with data) so that you can identify problem spots in your applications more easily. For more information, see the Node.js agent configuration documentation and the Node.js agent API documentation on Github. Request names The Node.js agent captures the HTTP method along with a potentially parameterized path (such as /user/:id) or a regular expression (such as /^/user/([-0-9a-f]+)$/). These pieces of information become part of the request name. If you have support for slow transaction traces and have enabled capture_params in your config file, the transaction trace will also have the request's parameters and their values attached to it. If you are dissatisfied with the request names that the Node.js agent uses, you can use API calls to create more descriptive names. Tip If grouping your requests under the generic name, then /* is sufficient, and you do not need to customize your configuration file or API calls. Requirements New Relic uses request names to group requests for many charts and tables. The value of these visualizations will drop as the number of different request names increases. For example, do not include potentially dynamic data like GUIDs, numerical IDs, or timestamps in the request names you create. If your request is slow enough to generate a transaction trace, that trace will contain the original URL. If you enable parameter capture, the parameters will also be attached to the trace. Tip Avoid having more than 50 different transaction names. For example, if you have more than a couple hundred different request names, rethink your naming strategy. Avoid metric grouping issues The request naming API helps New Relic avoid problems with trying to handle too many metrics, which sometimes is referred to as \"metric explosion.\" New Relic has several strategies to deal with these issues; the most severe is simply to add offending applications to your deny list. The main reason for you to be careful in using these request-naming tools is to prevent that from happening to your applications. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. Guidelines Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general. The first rules listed in your config file or added with the Node.js transaction naming API will be applied first and should be narrowly targeted. More general \"fall-through\" rules should be added toward the end of the list, because they will be evaluated in the order they were configured or added using the Node.js transaction naming API. URL pattern matching An online retailer has a URL pattern like this: /user/customers/all/prospects /user/customers/all/current /user/customers/all/returning /user/customers/John /user/customers/Jane Copy The retailer could create rules like this: // newrelic.js exports.config={ //other configuration rules:{ name:[ { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/prospects/\", name: \"/user/customers/all/prospects\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/all\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/:customer\" } ] } } Copy With these rules, the retailer would create three transaction names: /user/customers/:customer /user/customers/all /user/customers/all/prospects If the retailer reversed the order, the rules would catch all transactions in :customer, which would not be as useful. Load the request naming API Make sure that loading the New Relic module is the first thing your application does, as it needs to bootstrap itself before the rest of your application loads: var newrelic = require('newrelic'); Copy This returns the request naming API. You can safely require the module from multiple modules in your application, as it only initializes itself once. Request API calls Here is a summary of the Request API calls for New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.setTransactionName(name) newrelic.setTransactionName(name) Copy Name the current request, following the request naming requirements. You can call this function anywhere within the context of an HTTP request handler, at any time after handling of the request has started, but before the request has finished. In general, if the request and response objects are in scope, you can set the name. Explicitly calling newrelic.setTransactionName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. newrelic.setControllerName(name, \\[action]) newrelic.setControllerName(name, \\[action]) Copy Name the current request using a controller-style pattern, optionally including the current controller action. If the action is omitted, New Relic will include the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) as the action. The rules for when you can call newrelic.setControllerName() are the same as they are for newrelic.setTransactionName(), including the request naming requirements. Explicitly calling newrelic.setControllerName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. Custom instrumentation API calls Use these API calls to expand your instrumentation with custom instrumentation. newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a specific module. The provided onRequire callback will be fired when the given module is loaded with require. The moduleName parameter should be the string that will be passed to require; for example, 'express' or 'amqplib/callback_api'. The optional onError callback is called if the onRequire parameters throws an error. This is useful for debugging your instrumentation. Use this method to: Add instrumentation for modules not currently instrumented by New Relic. Instrument your own code. Replace the Node.js agent's built-in instrumentation with your own. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a datastore module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a datastore-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js datastore instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) Copy The instrumentLoadedModule method allows you to add stock instrumentation to specific modules in situations where it's impossible to have require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. // load the agent const newrelic = require('newrelic') // module loaded before newrelic const expressModule = require('express') // instrument express _after_ the agent has been loaded newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule( 'express', // the module's name, as a string expressModule // the module instance ); Copy Important This method cannot instrument any arbitrary module. Its purpose is to add modules that were missed because the agent was not loaded as the first thing in your program. The instrumentLoadedModule method can only instrument modules the agent would normally instrument. You can see a list of these modules in the agent's lib/instrumentations module. newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a message service client module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a message-service-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js message service instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a web framework module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a web-framework-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js web framework instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) Copy Instrument the specified web transaction. Using this API call, you can instrument transactions that New Relic does not automatically detect. The url defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The handle defines the function you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startWebTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, \\[group], handle) newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, \\[group], handle) Copy Instrument the specified background transaction. Using this API call, you can expand New Relic's instrumentation to capture data from background transactions. The name defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The group is optional, and it allows you to group similar jobs together via the transaction type in the user interface. Like name, the group needs to be static. The handle defines a function that includes the entire background job you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.getTransaction() Copy Returns a handle on the currently executing transaction. This handle can then be used to interact with a given transaction safely from any context. It is best used with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Please refer to the transaction handle section for more details. newrelic.endTransaction() newrelic.endTransaction() Copy End the current web or background custom transaction. This method requires being in the correct transaction context when called. This API call takes no arguments. newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) Copy Instrument a particular method to improve visibility into a transaction, or optionally turn it into a metric. The name defines a name for the segment. This name will be visible in transaction traces and as a new metric in the New Relic UI. The record flag defines whether the segment should be recorded as a metric. The handler is the function you want to track as a segment. The optional callback is a function passed to the handler to fire after its work is done. The agent begins timing the segment when startSegment is called. The segment is ended when either the handler finishes executing, or callback is fired, if it is provided. Custom metrics API calls Use these API calls to record additional arbitrary metrics: newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) Copy Use recordMetric to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The name must be a string following standard metric naming rules. The value will usually be a number, but it can also be an object. When value is a numeric value, it should represent the magnitude of a measurement associated with an event; for example, the duration for a particular method call. When value is an object, it must contain count, total, min, max, and sumOfSquares keys, all with number values. This form is useful to aggregate metrics on your own and report them periodically; for example, from a setInterval. These values will be aggregated with any previously collected values for the same metric. The names of these keys match the names of the keys used by the platform API. newrelic.incrementMetric(name, \\[amount]) newrelic.incrementMetric(name, \\[amount]) Copy Use incrementMetric to update a metric that acts as a simple counter. The count of the selected metric will be incremented by the specified amount, defaulting to 1. Custom events API calls Use these API calls to record additional events: newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. Recording a custom event The following example demonstrates recording a custom event with multiple attributes. const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.recordCustomEvent('MessagingEvent', attributes) Copy Transaction handle methods This section details the methods provided by the TransactionHandle class instance that can be obtained through newrelic.getTransaction(). Use these methods to interact directly with the current transaction: transactionHandle.end(\\[callback]) transactionHandle.end(\\[callback]) Copy Use transactionHandle.end to end the transaction referenced by the handle instance. The callback is invoked when the transaction has fully ended. The finished transaction passed to the callback as the first argument. transactionHandle.ignore() transactionHandle.ignore() Copy Use transactionHandle.ignore to ignore the transaction referenced by the handle instance. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call acceptDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders is used to implement distributed tracing. It modifies the headers map that is passed in by adding W3C Trace Context headers and New Relic Distributed Trace headers. The New Relic headers can be disabled with distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header: true in the config. This method replaces the deprecated createDistributedTracePayload method, which only creates New Relic Distributed Trace payloads. Generating distributed trace headers In the following example, by calling insertDistributedTraceHeaders with an empty object, the appropriate Distributed Trace headers and W3C Trace Context headers will be generated for the transaction. // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // This could be a header object from an incoming request as well const headersObject = {} newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // generate the headers transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call insertDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting a payload generated by insertDistributedTraceHeaders or generated by some other W3C Trace Context compliant tracer. This method accepts the headers of an incoming request, looks for W3C Trace Context headers, and if not found, falls back to New Relic distributed trace headers. This method replaces the deprecated (and now removed as of version 7.0.0) acceptDistributedTracePayload method, which only handles New Relic distributed trace payloads. transportType should be one of the following strings: AMQP HTTP HTTPS IronMQ JMS Kafka Other Queue Unknown headers should be an object containing all the headers in the incoming request. The keys must be lowercase. Accept incoming distributed trace headers The following example demonstrates adding distributed trace headers retrieved from a Kafka message. In this example, we assume that the incoming Kafka message has Distributed Trace headers inserted. // incoming Kafka message headers const headersObject = message.headers // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // accept the headers transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders('Kafka', headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use insertDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For instructions on how to use this call, along with its partner call acceptDistributedTracePayload, see Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. This call is used to implement distributed tracing. It generates a payload that is read by the receiving application with acceptDistributedTracePayload. Important Note: In order to maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, you must generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. The DistributedTracePayload object has two available methods used for generating the payload in different formats: DistributedTracePayload#text: returns a JSON representation of the payload. Link a nested background transaction // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() var jsonPayload = payload.text() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { var backgroundHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // Link the nested transaction by accepting the payload with the background transaction's handle backgroundHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(jsonPayload) }) Copy DistributedTracePayload#httpSafe: returns a base64 encoded JSON representation of the payload. Place payload on an outgoing request // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() // Place the base64 encoded value on an outbound request header. req.headers[myTracingHeader] = payload.httpSafe() Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use acceptDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call createDistributedTracePayload, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting the payload generated by createDistributedTracePayload. transactionHandle.isSampled() transactionHandle.isSampled() Copy Returns whether this trace is being sampled. Other API calls New Relic's Node.js agent includes additional API calls. newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom attribute value to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in New Relic APM's transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Add custom attribute newrelic.addCustomAttribute('attribute1', 'value1') Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in the transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Adding custom attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom span attribute value to be displayed along with a transaction trace span in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attribute newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute('attribute1', 'value') Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom span attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace spans in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 'value2' } newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() Copy Returns the HTML snippet to be inserted into the header of HTML pages to enable New Relic Browser. The HTML will instruct the browser to fetch a small JavaScript file and start the page timer. newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) Copy Tell the module whether or not to ignore a given request. This allows you to explicitly filter long-polling, irrelevant routes or requests you know will be time-consuming. This also allows you to gather metrics for requests that otherwise would be ignored. To ignore the transaction, set the parameter to true will ignore the transaction. To prevent a transaction from being ignored with this function, pass the parameter false. Passing null or undefined will not change whether the transaction is ignored. Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0. Please use transactionHandle.ignore() newrelic.noticeError(error, \\[customParameters]) newrelic.noticeError(error, \\[customParameters]) Copy Use this call if your app is doing its own error handling with domains or try/catch clauses, but you want all of the information about how many errors are coming out of the app to be centrally managed. Unlike other Node.js calls, this can be used outside of route handlers, but it will have additional context if called from within transaction scope. Caution Errors recorded using this method do not obey the ignore_status_codes configuration value. newrelic.shutdown(\\[options], callback) newrelic.shutdown(\\[options], callback) Copy Use this method to gracefully shut down the agent. options options.collectPendingData - type boolean - Tell the agent whether to send any pending data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. options.timeout - type number (ms) - The default time before forcing a shutdown. When collectPendingData is true, the agent will wait for a connection before shutting down. This timeout is useful for short lived processes, like AWS Lambda, in order to keep the process from staying open too long, while trying to connect. Example: newrelic.shutdown({collectPendingData: true, timeout: 3000}, (error) => { process.exit() }) Copy newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() Copy Returns key/value pairs which can be used to link traces or entities. It will only contain items with meaningful values. For instance, if distributed tracing is disabled, trace.id will not be included. newrelic.getTraceMetadata() newrelic.getTraceMetadata() Copy Returns and object containing the current trace ID and span ID. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled or an empty object will be returned. Rules for naming and ignoring requests If you do not want to put calls to the New Relic module directly into your application code, you can use pattern-based rules to name requests. There are two sets of rules: one for renaming requests, and one to mark requests to be ignored by New Relic's instrumentation. Here is the structure for rules in New Relic's Node.js agent. rules.name A list of rules of the format {pattern : \"pattern\", name : \"name\"} for matching incoming request URLs to pattern and naming the matching New Relic transaction's name. This acts as a regex replace, where you can set the pattern either as a string, or as a JavaScript regular expression literal, and both pattern and name are required. When passing a regex as a string, escape backslashes, as the agent does not keep them when given as a string in a pattern. Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general, as the patterns will be evaluated in order and are terminal in nature. For more information, see the naming guidelines. This can also be set with the environment variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy Optional rules attributes [#optional-rules] Additional optional attributes are available: Optional rules attributes Description terminate_chain Default: true When set to true (default), no further rules will be evaluated if this rule is a match. Setting this to false is useful when multiple rules should be used together. For example, one rule could be replacing a common pattern in many different URLs, while subsequent rule(s) would be more specific. replace_all Default: false When set to true, all matches of the pattern will be replaced. Otherwise, only the first match will be replaced. Using the g flag with regular expression literal will have the same effect. For example: pattern: '[0-9]+', replace_all: true Copy This has the same effect as pattern: /[0-9]+/g. precedence By default the rules are evaluated in order, from first to last. If you prefer to have complete control over the order, you can give each rule a precedence attribute. The precedence is an integer number, and rules are evaluated in ascending order. If precedence is not explicitly defined, it will be set to 500 by default. Additional attributes are ignored. Testing your naming rules [#testing-rules] The Node.js agent comes with a command-line tool for testing naming rules. For more information, run the following command in terminal window in a directory where your app is installed: node node_modules/.bin/newrelic-naming-rules Copy Naming rule examples [#examples-rules] Here are some examples of naming rules and the results. Match full URL pattern: \"^/items/[0-9]+$\", name: \"/items/:id\" Copy will result in: /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123 => /orders/123 (not replaced since the rule is a full match) Copy Replace first match in URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\" Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/123 Copy Replace all matches in any URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\", replace_all: true Copy will result in: /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/:id Copy Match group references Using regular expression match group references: pattern: '^/(items|orders)/[0-9]+$', name: '/\\\\1/:id' Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id Copy rules.ignore This can also be set via the environment variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited patterns. Currently there is no way to escape commas in patterns. NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES='^/socket\\.io/\\*/xhr-polling,ignore_me' Copy Here are full examples of how rules are included in the configuration file: Naming rule example // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { name : [ { pattern: \"/tables/name-here\", name: \"/name-hererule1\" } ] } Copy Ignoring rule example If you are using socket.io, you will have a use case for ignoring rules right out of the box. To keep socket.io long-polling from dominating your response-time metrics and affecting the Apdex metrics for your application, add a rule such as: // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { ignore : [ '^\\/socket\\.io\\/.*\\/xhr-polling' ] } }; Copy API calls for rules Here are the API calls for naming and ignoring rules with New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.addNamingRule(pattern, name) Programmatic version of rules.name. Once naming rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. Both parameters are required. newrelic.addIgnoringRule(pattern) Programmatic version of rules.ignore. Once ignoring rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. This parameter is required.",

      "body": "If you are having problems using the Java agent API for async tokens and segments, use these techniques to help you find answers and solve problems. Verify your instrumentation The API has a number of built-in safety mechanisms to prevent issues caused by incorrect API usage, but you can use these techniques to verify that your application’s instrumentation is correct: After instrumenting your code, verify that the logs show that an equal number of tokens have been created and expired. For more information on which log messages to look for, see Use logs to troubleshoot. Check the garbage collection statistics under APM's JVMs page to determine whether or not your changes have significantly altered garbage collection patterns. Check if any segments or tokens are timing out by reviewing your transaction traces for a timed_out attribute. If so, you can change the limit with token_timeout and segment_timeout. Use logs to troubleshoot To customize your Java agent logging, see Generating logs. Then, you can examine your logs for these common messages: To view created tokens, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@5a7cc8e: created active token com.newrelic.agent.TokenImpl@7db8d0e8 Copy To view expired tokens and the time that they expired, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@5a7cc8e: expired token com.newrelic.agent.TokenImpl@7db8d0e8 Copy To view created segments, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@486b7f04: startSegment(): com.newrelic.agent.Segment@2b7fdad3 created and started with tracer com.newrelic.agent.tracers.OtherRootTracer@4df4a953 Copy To view ended segments and the time that they ended, check logs at FINEST for: com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@486b7f04--finish segment(): com.newrelic.agent.Segment@2b7fdad3 async finish with tracer com.newrelic.agent.tracers.OtherRootTracer@4df4a953 Copy Problem: Transaction times are too long Make sure to expire tokens and end or ignore segments; otherwise transactions may take longer to report to New Relic. The Java agent has a timeout mechanism for tokens and segments that are not ended correctly. For more information, see token_timeout and segment_timeout. Problem: No transaction trace data Inspect transaction traces to make sure expected asynchronous work is reported. If you do not see any transaction traces, make sure your transaction duration exceeds the transaction trace threshold set in transaction_threshold. Problem: Too few async calls If too few calls are being reported: Ensure that each activity you monitor is appropriately linked In the faulty example below, a parallel stream is being used, which means that the work done inside the lambda in the call to map() can be scheduled on a different thread than the thread handling the request. Without creating a token to link all this work together, you will not see any of the work that gets scheduled on a different thread inside of your transaction. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_bad\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamBad(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(i -> requestItem(i)) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_bad\", results); } Copy Check if you are missing required annotations The example below will report only a subset of the calls to requestItem() because it is impossible to put @Trace(async = true) around blocks of anonymous work inside the call to map(). Instead, you should pass the token into requestItem() and link it, and then add @Trace(async=true) around it. Or use a helper function like requestItemAsync() to do this without changing your existing methods. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_bad2\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamBad2(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken(); List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> { token.link(); return requestItem(id); }) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_bad2\", results); } Copy Compare this to the correct example below, in which the lambda expression is wrapped by the wrapper class InstrumentedCallable. This class accepts a token and a lambda, then wraps asynchronous work in @Trace(async = true) and uses a token to link the work to the request thread. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_wrap\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamWrap(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken(); List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> InstrumentedCallable.instrumentCallable(token, () -> requestItem(id))) .map(c -> c.call()) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); token.expire(); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_wrap\", results); } Copy",

      "body": "If you are having problems using the Java agent API for async tokens and segments, use these techniques to help you find answers and solve problems. Verify your instrumentation The API has a number of built-in safety mechanisms to prevent issues caused by incorrect API usage, but you can use these techniques to verify that your application’s instrumentation is correct: After instrumenting your code, verify that the logs show that an equal number of tokens have been created and expired. For more information on which log messages to look for, see Use logs to troubleshoot. Check the garbage collection statistics under APM's JVMs page to determine whether or not your changes have significantly altered garbage collection patterns. Check if any segments or tokens are timing out by reviewing your transaction traces for a timed_out attribute. If so, you can change the limit with token_timeout and segment_timeout. Use logs to troubleshoot To customize your Java agent logging, see Generating logs. Then, you can examine your logs for these common messages: To view created tokens, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@5a7cc8e: created active token com.newrelic.agent.TokenImpl@7db8d0e8 Copy To view expired tokens and the time that they expired, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@5a7cc8e: expired token com.newrelic.agent.TokenImpl@7db8d0e8 Copy To view created segments, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@486b7f04: startSegment(): com.newrelic.agent.Segment@2b7fdad3 created and started with tracer com.newrelic.agent.tracers.OtherRootTracer@4df4a953 Copy To view ended segments and the time that they ended, check logs at FINEST for: com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@486b7f04--finish segment(): com.newrelic.agent.Segment@2b7fdad3 async finish with tracer com.newrelic.agent.tracers.OtherRootTracer@4df4a953 Copy Problem: Transaction times are too long Make sure to expire tokens and end or ignore segments; otherwise transactions may take longer to report to New Relic. The Java agent has a timeout mechanism for tokens and segments that are not ended correctly. For more information, see token_timeout and segment_timeout. Problem: No transaction trace data Inspect transaction traces to make sure expected asynchronous work is reported. If you do not see any transaction traces, make sure your transaction duration exceeds the transaction trace threshold set in transaction_threshold. Problem: Too few async calls If too few calls are being reported: Ensure that each activity you monitor is appropriately linked In the faulty example below, a parallel stream is being used, which means that the work done inside the lambda in the call to map() can be scheduled on a different thread than the thread handling the request. Without creating a token to link all this work together, you will not see any of the work that gets scheduled on a different thread inside of your transaction. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_bad\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamBad(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(i -> requestItem(i)) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_bad\", results); } Copy Check if you are missing required annotations The example below will report only a subset of the calls to requestItem() because it is impossible to put @Trace(async = true) around blocks of anonymous work inside the call to map(). Instead, you should pass the token into requestItem() and link it, and then add @Trace(async=true) around it. Or use a helper function like requestItemAsync() to do this without changing your existing methods. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_bad2\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamBad2(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken(); List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> { token.link(); return requestItem(id); }) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_bad2\", results); } Copy Compare this to the correct example below, in which the lambda expression is wrapped by the wrapper class InstrumentedCallable. This class accepts a token and a lambda, then wraps asynchronous work in @Trace(async = true) and uses a token to link the work to the request thread. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_wrap\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamWrap(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken(); List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> InstrumentedCallable.instrumentCallable(token, () -> requestItem(id))) .map(c -> c.call()) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); token.expire(); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_wrap\", results); } Copy",

The call name is add_custom_parameters because \"custom attributes\" were previously called \"custom parameters\". Attributes may be found in APM if the transaction is associated with an error or if a transaction trace is generated for that transaction. Attributes can also be found and queried in New Relic One. Important Before you create custom attributes, review our list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Parameters Parameter Description items list Required. Each item in the list must be a tuple, with the first element being a key, and the second its value. Each key is a string representing the name of an attribute, and each corresponding value is the value to add to the current transaction for this attribute. Values can be int, float, string, or boolean. Only the first 255 characters are retained for both keys and values. Return values Returns True if all attributes were added successfully. Examples Adding custom parameters to background task An example of adding custom parameters to a background task: @newrelic.agent.background_task() def send_request(): response = requests.get(\"http://example.com\") newrelic.agent.add_custom_parameters( [(\"url_path_status_code\", response.status_code)] ) Copy Using custom parameters to troubleshoot You can also use custom parameters to troubleshoot performance issues. For example, you might see occasional slow response times from a pool of memcache instances, but you don't know what instance is causing the problem. You might add an attribute to the transaction indicating the server, like so: # Set server_ip to be the current server processing the transaction newrelic.agent.add_custom_parameters([ (\"memcache_query_frontend_lookup\", \"server_ip\") ]) Copy",

This also includes a summary of the Python agent configuration settings that have been deprecated with the release of agent attributes. Configuration settings Use the following destination settings to open or close the destination to any attribute collection: attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or turns off all attributes. transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or turns off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless of how this configuration setting is set. error_collector.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this configuration setting is set. transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this configuration setting is set. browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: False Turns on or turns off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data that gets sent to the PageView destination. If attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to browser monitoring regardless of how this configuration setting is set. Use the following attribute/destination specific .include or .exclude settings to add or remove specific attributes in specific destinations: attributes.include Type: Space-Separated List of Strings Default: (none) If attributes are enabled, all attribute keys in this list will be sent. attributes.exclude Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) All attribute keys in this list will not be sent. transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys in this list will be sent in transaction traces. transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) All attribute keys in this list will not be sent in transaction traces. error_collector.attributes.include Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys in this list will be sent in traced errors. error_collector.attributes.exclude Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) All attribute keys in this list will not be sent in traced errors. transaction_events.attributes.include Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent in transaction events. transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) All attribute keys in this list will not be sent in transaction events. browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys in this list will be sent in page views. browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in page views. Attribute rules The agent follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination: Root level takes precedence for enabled. The attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported. Example configuration: attributes.enabled = false attributes.include = foo bar transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, baz Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: foo, bar, baz Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. The YOUR_DESTINATION.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false attributes.include = one two transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: attributes.enabled = true attributes.exclude = baz Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, baz Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: baz Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: attributes.enabled = true attributes.include = foo bar attributes.exclude = nerd bar Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, nerd Keys included: foo Keys excluded: nerd, bar Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case-sensitive. Example configuration: attributes.enabled = true attributes.exclude = username UsErNaMe Copy Example output: Keys passed in: username, Username, USERNAME, UsErNaMe, userNAME Keys included: Username, USERNAME, userNAME Keys excluded: username, UsErNaMe Copy Use \\* for wildcards. You can use an asterisk * at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: attributes.enabled = true attributes.include = custom* attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: attributes.enabled = true attributes.include = request.parameters.foo attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: attributes.include = foo transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated configuration settings The following configuration settings have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these settings when upgrading your Python agent. Deprecated setting New setting capture_params attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent. Add request.parameters.* to the attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters.

This also includes a summary of the Python agent configuration settings that have been deprecated with the release of agent attributes. Configuration settings Use the following destination settings to open or close the destination to any attribute collection: attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or turns off all attributes. transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled Type Boolean Default True Turns on or turns off all attributes for transaction traces. If attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction traces regardless of how this configuration setting is set. error_collector.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for traced errors. If attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to traced errors regardless of how this configuration setting is set. transaction_events.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: True Turns on or turns off all attributes for transaction events. If attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to transaction events regardless of how this configuration setting is set. browser_monitoring.attributes.enabled Type: Boolean Default: False Turns on or turns off all attributes for browser monitoring. This is the data that gets sent to the PageView destination. If attributes.enabled is false, no attributes will be sent to browser monitoring regardless of how this configuration setting is set. Use the following attribute/destination specific .include or .exclude settings to add or remove specific attributes in specific destinations: attributes.include Type: Space-Separated List of Strings Default: (none) If attributes are enabled, all attribute keys in this list will be sent. attributes.exclude Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) All attribute keys in this list will not be sent. transaction_tracer.attributes.include Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction traces, all attribute keys in this list will be sent in transaction traces. transaction_tracer.attributes.exclude Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) All attribute keys in this list will not be sent in transaction traces. error_collector.attributes.include Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) If attributes are enabled for traced errors, all attribute keys in this list will be sent in traced errors. error_collector.attributes.exclude Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) All attribute keys in this list will not be sent in traced errors. transaction_events.attributes.include Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) If attributes are enabled for transaction events, all attribute keys in this list will be sent in transaction events. transaction_events.attributes.exclude Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) All attribute keys in this list will not be sent in transaction events. browser_monitoring.attributes.include Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) If attributes are enabled for browser_monitoring, all attribute keys in this list will be sent in page views. browser_monitoring.attributes.exclude Type: Space-separated list of strings Default: (none) All attribute keys found in this list will not be sent in page views. Attribute rules The agent follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination: Root level takes precedence for enabled. The attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported. Example configuration: attributes.enabled = false attributes.include = foo bar transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, baz Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: foo, bar, baz Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. The YOUR_DESTINATION.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false attributes.include = one two transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: attributes.enabled = true attributes.exclude = baz Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, baz Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: baz Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: attributes.enabled = true attributes.include = foo bar attributes.exclude = nerd bar Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, nerd Keys included: foo Keys excluded: nerd, bar Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case-sensitive. Example configuration: attributes.enabled = true attributes.exclude = username UsErNaMe Copy Example output: Keys passed in: username, Username, USERNAME, UsErNaMe, userNAME Keys included: Username, USERNAME, userNAME Keys excluded: username, UsErNaMe Copy Use \\* for wildcards. You can use an asterisk * at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: attributes.enabled = true attributes.include = custom* attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: attributes.enabled = true attributes.include = request.parameters.foo attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: attributes.include = foo transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated configuration settings The following configuration settings have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these settings when upgrading your Python agent. Deprecated setting New setting capture_params attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent. Add request.parameters.* to the attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters.

Description This call records one or more custom attributes (a key/value tuple attached to your transaction). The call name is add_custom_parameters because \"custom attributes\" were previously called \"custom parameters\". Attributes may be found in APM if the transaction is associated with an error or if a transaction trace is generated for that transaction. Attributes can also be found and queried in New Relic One. Important Before you create custom attributes, review our list of reserved terms used by NRQL. Parameters Parameter Description items list Required. Each item in the list must be a tuple, with the first element being a key, and the second its value. Each key is a string representing the name of an attribute, and each corresponding value is the value to add to the current transaction for this attribute. Values can be int, float, string, or boolean. Only the first 255 characters are retained for both keys and values. Return values Returns True if all attributes were added successfully. Examples Adding custom parameters to background task An example of adding custom parameters to a background task: @newrelic.agent.background_task() def send_request(): response = requests.get(\"http://example.com\") newrelic.agent.add_custom_parameters( [(\"url_path_status_code\", response.status_code)] ) Copy Using custom parameters to troubleshoot You can also use custom parameters to troubleshoot performance issues. For example, you might see occasional slow response times from a pool of memcache instances, but you don't know what instance is causing the problem. You might add an attribute to the transaction indicating the server, like so: # Set server_ip to be the current server processing the transaction newrelic.agent.add_custom_parameters([ (\"memcache_query_frontend_lookup\", \"server_ip\") ]) Copy",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

The global_settings object contains settings in the configuration file and environment variables; this application_settings object additionally includes configuration changes set server-side via the New Relic UI. The returned settings are nested, hierarchical objects and the setting names match the names in the agent configuration file. The main reason to expose the application settings is if you want your instrumentation to reference the agent-specific local configuration and not what's set server-side. If the name value is not set, the call uses the application name specified in the agent config file or via the NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME environment variable. If the application hasn't been registered with the data collector when this call is made, it returns the value None. When a call is successfully made and returns values, it will reflect the values of any local configuration overlaid with the server-side configuration for that application obtained during registration. Important Do not make any changes to the application settings object. Do not cache the settings object because it will be invalidated and replaced if a server-side config change causes the agent to re-register the application with the data collector. Parameters Parameter Description name string Optional. The name of the application. If not set, the name matches the name set in the Python agent configuration for that application. Return values Returns an application settings object. The object itself does not present any public API; some other calls require it to be passed. Examples Using an IF statement You might want to check the configuration settings to determine what custom instrumentation to implement. Here's an example of using an if statement with the app settings object: settings = newrelic.agent.application_settings() if settings and settings.error_collector.enabled: ... Copy Passing results into dict If you are debugging or logging and require the global settings as a traditional Python dictionary object, you can pass the result into a dict. For example: settings_dict = dict(newrelic.agent.application_settings()) for name, value in settings_dict.items(): print name, value Copy Each name will be the full dotted path for that setting.",

Depending on the language agent, available settings may include: Transaction tracing SQL recording and logging SQL query plans Error collection Thread profiling Distributed tracing Cross application tracing Centralization and security Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic UI. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change automatically applies to all New Relic APM agents, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings not available from the UI. Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly within the New Relic UI, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you utilize environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls. Also, server-side configuration is not supported. However, you can change the app name from the UI or from the C SDK configuration settings. Go hierarchy Java hierarchy .NET hierarchy Node.js hierarchy PHP hierarchy (server-side configuration not supported) Python hierarchy Ruby hierarchy Enable server-side configuration Tip Owner, Admins, or Add-on Managers The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To enable server-side configuration settings for apps that use other New Relic agents: Go to rpm.newrelic.com/apm > (select an app) > Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. OR Go to rpm.newrelic.com/apm. Next, from the index of applications, select the app's gear icon, then select View settings > Server-side agent configuration. Set the Server-side configuration enabled toggle to On. Select Save server-side configuration. After you enable server-side configuration, you can view and change the available settings through the UI. View or change server-side configuration settings Tip Owner, Admins, or Add-on Managers If you use server-side configuration, you must still include your license_key and app_name in the local config file. These settings are required for the agent to communicate with the New Relic collector. The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To view or change the available server-side configuration settings through the UI for apps that use other New Relic agents: Go to rpm.newrelic.com/apm > (select an app) > Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. OR Go to rpm.newrelic.com/apm. Next, from the index of applications, select the app's gear icon, then select View settings > Server-side agent configuration. View or change the available configuration settings for your agent. If you make changes, select Save server-side configuration. Once you set any of these options from the UI, they will override any conflicting options in the agent's configuration file. Disable server-side configuration Once you enable server-side configuration for an account, server-side configuration cannot be turned off without assistance from New Relic Support. This helps mitigate issues that could arise from conflicts with configuration settings if you need to transition back to a local configuration setup.",

      "body": "Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve performance issues. You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze business data to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for custom instrumentation and APIs, The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app. Our Python works with a wide variety of web frameworks and hosting mechanisms, including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Tip To use Python or any other agent, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Monitor app performance After you install the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in New Relic One. View the big picture of your app. Monitor your app's Apdex (user satisfaction). Get a high-level summary of your app with Summary page. Enable distributed tracing to see activity across an architecture having many services. Install Infrastructure monitoring and view detailed server/host data for your app. Find errors and problems quickly. Track key transactions specific to your business. Create custom dashboards for important metrics. Alert your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users. View performance after a deployment. Drill down into performance details. Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with Browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read some documentation about Full-Stack Observability. For example, read about the capabilities of Full-Stack observability and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

If the application hasn't been registered with the data collector when this call is made, it returns the value None. When a call is successfully made and returns values, it will reflect the values of any local configuration overlaid with the server-side configuration for that application obtained during registration. Important Do not make any changes to the application settings object. Do not cache the settings object because it will be invalidated and replaced if a server-side config change causes the agent to re-register the application with the data collector. Parameters Parameter Description name string Optional. The name of the application. If not set, the name matches the name set in the Python agent configuration for that application. Return values Returns an application settings object. The object itself does not present any public API; some other calls require it to be passed. Examples Using an IF statement You might want to check the configuration settings to determine what custom instrumentation to implement. Here's an example of using an if statement with the app settings object: settings = newrelic.agent.application_settings() if settings and settings.error_collector.enabled: ... Copy Passing results into dict If you are debugging or logging and require the global settings as a traditional Python dictionary object, you can pass the result into a dict. For example: settings_dict = dict(newrelic.agent.application_settings()) for name, value in settings_dict.items(): print name, value Copy Each name will be the full dotted path for that setting.",

      "body": "You can extend the Python agent's monitoring to trace time spent in additional functions or methods of classes by modifying your configuration file. This form of custom instrumentation is simpler to implement than API calls, and does not require you to modify your code. However, for more complex needs, you may need to implement Python instrumentation by API. Listing functions in the configuration file To extend instrumentation to designated functions and class methods, add them to the transaction_tracer.function_trace setting within the newrelic section of the agent configuration file. The identifier for a function should have the form module:function and that of a class method module:class.function. Using dumbdbm In this example, you use the Python dumbdbm module and want to instrument the time it took to open a database, and then to write that database back to a file. In this case you would use: transaction_tracer.function_trace = dumbdbm:open dumbdbm:_Database._commit Copy To list more than one item, use either of these methods: One line: Separate each item with a space. Multiple lines: Follow the ini file convention to indent the subsequent lines. When data is reported for the instrumented function, the metric will have a name in the form Function/module:function or Function/module:class.function. In the performance breakdown for a transaction, the category will show as Function and the segment will be module:function or module:class.function. For slow transaction traces, only the segment name appears. Note that where a function is actually returning a generator, only the time spent in returning the generator will be recorded and not the consumption of the values from the generator. Restrictions on wrapping extension APIs When wrapping functions by listing them in the agent configuration file, you cannot designate class methods this way when the method is a member of a class which is implemented in C code by a C extension module. This is because it is not possible to modify the method table of a type implemented using the Python C API. Overriding the reported function name When using the transaction_tracer.function_trace setting in the agent configuration file, the name of the function will be used in the metric name, with it being classified as a Function. If it is necessary to override what function name may be used in the metric name or classify it differently, then an alternate means of defining the function trace in the configuration file can be used. The equivalent for: transaction_tracer.function_trace = dumbdbm:open dumbdbm:_Database._commit Copy would be to create two new configuration sections in the agent configuration file, one for each function to be traced: [function-trace:dumbdbm-1] enabled = true function = dumbdbm:open name = dumbdbm:open group = Function [function-trace:dumbdbm-2] enabled = true function = dumbdbm:_Database._commit name = dumbdbm:_Database._commit group = Function Copy The ini file section name should start with function-trace:. The name component that follows that prefix can be anything but should be unique across all function trace sections in the configuration file. The group and name settings can be overridden as necessary to arrive at the desired metric name. The enabled setting defaults to false and needs to be set to true to enable the function trace. Instrument with the API For simple custom instrumentation purposes, the config file method works well. For more precise and customized instrumentation and agent behavior adjustments, you will want to use the Python agent API.",

Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read some documentation about Full-Stack Observability. For example, read about the capabilities of Full-Stack observability and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic's Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements. Basic requirements The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. Resource Requirements Operating systems UNIX-like operating systems including Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and macOS. The Python agent does not support Windows environments. Python Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 Recommendation: Use Python version 3.6 or higher with our agent. Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower. Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower. Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 follow our end of life (EOL) support requirements. Supported web frameworks Supported web frameworks include: Aiohttp Bottle CherryPy Django Falcon FastAPI Flask gRPC Pylons Pyramid Sanic Starlette Tornado 6 Web2Py Unsupported frameworks Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces. In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation. Hosting Web hosting mechanisms compliant with WSGI 1.0 (PEP 333). For example, you can install the Python agent in a Google App Engine flexible environment. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Other monitoring software If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors while using other monitoring software. Python package instrumentation The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python packages and modules. Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, instance-level details, and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions. Python version support The agent in general will support all released and active Python branches. However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general New Relic agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. Support for new Python releases The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Python agent with support 3.8 October 21, 2019 November-December 2019 End of support for Python releases reaching EOL The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Python version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Python agent dropping support 3.5 September 13, 2020 Deprecated as of Python agent version 5.22.0.151 Python agent versions released after December 22, 2020 do not support Python 3.5. For more information, see our Python agent release notes and our Explorers Hub post. 2.7 January 1, 2020 TBD Connect the agent to other Full-Stack Observability capabilities The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Python agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see APM data in Infrastructure. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read some documentation about Full-Stack Observability. For example, read about the capabilities of Full-Stack observability and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "The Python agent default security settings automatically provide security for your data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information we ingest. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that we ingest you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the Python agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: The agent does not collect message queue parameters. You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: Python agent configuration file Custom attributes Python agent API Tip Some of these settings can be changed using environment variables. See Python agent environment variables for the complete list. Setting Effects on data security audit_log_file string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the data collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the collector to see if it includes sensitive information. high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security. This restricts the information you can send. proxy_host string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes. If you do not want to send attributes, set this to false. attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send in transaction traces, identify them using attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. (Note that HTTP headers that contain sensitive data such as cookie and authorization are never collected.) response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Insights custom events API via record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated. strip_exception_messages.enabled boolean Default: false If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to true. If you are not using high security mode but want to strip messages from all exceptions except those in your allow list, set this to true.",
