      "body": "With New Relic's Node.js agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime Use native deploy To use Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with your Node.js app: Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Optional: Set environment variables to configure the Node.js agent's GAE app.yaml file. Use the Google Cloud SDK's gcloud command line tool to deploy GAE apps. To deploy your Node.js app to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud --project new-relic-apm-nodejs app deploy Copy Google App Engine automatically includes your Node.js app's newrelic.js configuration file in the deployed package. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. You can deploy the app without any special configuration. For more information about deploying and configuring your Node.js app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Node.js Google App Engine's tutorial to deploy a Node.js app 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: runtime: custom env: flex Copy Optional: Set environment variables. 3. Configure and deploy The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the Dockerfile, build the container, and deploy your app, follow the GAE procedures for Node.js. Wait until the deployment completes. To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Optional: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. If you notice performance issues, disable GAE health checks. In your app.yaml, add: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic Node.js agent logs to Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.js configuration file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.",

      "body": "With New Relic's Node.js agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime Use native deploy To use Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with your Node.js app: Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Optional: Set environment variables to configure the Node.js agent's GAE app.yaml file. Use the Google Cloud SDK's gcloud command line tool to deploy GAE apps. To deploy your Node.js app to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud --project new-relic-apm-nodejs app deploy Copy Google App Engine automatically includes your Node.js app's newrelic.js configuration file in the deployed package. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. You can deploy the app without any special configuration. For more information about deploying and configuring your Node.js app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Node.js Google App Engine's tutorial to deploy a Node.js app 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: runtime: custom env: flex Copy Optional: Set environment variables. 3. Configure and deploy The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the Dockerfile, build the container, and deploy your app, follow the GAE procedures for Node.js. Wait until the deployment completes. To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Optional: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. If you notice performance issues, disable GAE health checks. In your app.yaml, add: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance.

Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. Ensure you meet the system requirements. In particular, make sure you use a supported Node version. Use the command npm install newrelic --save for each application you want to monitor. From node_modules/newrelic, copy newrelic.js into the root directory of your app. Configure agent via the newrelic.js file or via environment variable: Customize the license_key setting with your license key. Customize the app_name setting with one or more meaningful app names. Add require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. Optional: For additional Node.js runtime-level statistics, ensure the @newrelic/native-metrics package is installed. Generate some traffic, then wait a few minutes for data to appear in the APM UI. You can further customize your agent behavior via newrelic.js or an environment variable. To keep the agent configuration separate from your app, edit the NEW_RELIC_HOME environmental variable. Keep your Node.js agent up-to-date To ensure that you have the most up-to-date version of New Relic, refer to the Node.js release notes. When applicable, the release notes include a download link with instructions on how to update the Node.js agent.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

      "body": "With New Relic's Node.js agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM and browser monitoring. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app using either of these methods: Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with a standard GAE runtime Docker installation using a custom runtime Use native deploy To use Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation with your Node.js app: Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Optional: Set environment variables to configure the Node.js agent's GAE app.yaml file. Use the Google Cloud SDK's gcloud command line tool to deploy GAE apps. To deploy your Node.js app to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud --project new-relic-apm-nodejs app deploy Copy Google App Engine automatically includes your Node.js app's newrelic.js configuration file in the deployed package. Wait until the deployment completes, then view your GAE flex app data in the APM Summary page. Build a custom runtime See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by building a custom runtime for Docker. You can deploy the app without any special configuration. For more information about deploying and configuring your Node.js app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Node.js Google App Engine's tutorial to deploy a Node.js app 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install New Relic's Node.js agent, including your license key. Be sure to save the newrelic module to the package.json file. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Node.js to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: runtime: custom env: flex Copy Optional: Set environment variables. 3. Configure and deploy The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. To create the Dockerfile, build the container, and deploy your app, follow the GAE procedures for Node.js. Wait until the deployment completes. To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Optional: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. If you notice performance issues, disable GAE health checks. In your app.yaml, add: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance.

      "body": "With APM's Java agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM, browser monitoring, and dashboards. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by configuring a custom runtime, and gives an example of deploying a Tomcat app with Docker. Important The New Relic Java agent can run in a GAE flexible environment using a custom runtime. Due to limitations of other environments, do not use the GAE standard environment or Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation. Build a custom runtime using Docker See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. There are many ways to build a custom runtime that contains the New Relic Java agent (for example, using Tomcat). In general, to build a custom runtime: Set up your application and install necessary GAE-related dependencies for custom runtimes. Include the New Relic Java agent in the project. Configure Maven or Gradle as applicable. Configure the app.yaml file. Configure the Dockerfile. Build the Docker image. Deploy the Docker image to the initialized GAE flexible environment. Recommendation: Disable GAE health checks. For more information about deploying and configuring your Java app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for Java Google App Engine's tutorials to deploy a Java app GAE flex example with Tomcat This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by installing the New Relic Java agent, building a custom runtime, and deploying an application WAR to Tomcat. Be sure to install the Java agent as necessary for your specific app server. 1. Set up GAE flexible project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install the Java agent as necessary for your specific app server, and obtain your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for Java to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. Install any necessary dependencies, such as the Maven or Gradle App Engine plugin, and Java. The Google Cloud SDKprovides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Configure Maven pom.xml to include Java agent and build project This example uses Maven to build the project, a Docker Tomcat image to run it, and the gcloud command line tool to deploy the Docker image to a GAE flexible environment. Add the Java agent dependencies to the project's target directory when the project is built, when you download and unzip all Java agent components. After adding the Java agent dependencies to the pom.xml, build your application by running: mvn clean install Copy Check your project's target directory to find the app's WAR file and an unzipped newrelic directory. These files will be incorporated into a Docker image. Tip You can also add the App Engine Maven or Jetty Maven plugin to your pom.xml. This will allow you to use Maven to deploy your app to a GAE flexible environment. 3. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom Copy 4. Configure the Dockerfile The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. In the following Dockerfile example code, the newrelic.yml and catalina.sh files have been configured locally, to replace those already copied to the Docker image. (You can add your New Relic license key directly to your Dockerfile, or use an environment variable in your docker run command.) # base Tomcat image to build Docker image from FROM tomcat:8.5.14-jre8 MAINTAINER Jane Doe <janedoe@mail.com> # Tomcat directory to copy Java agent files to ENV NEWRELIC_HOME /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic # copy application war from target to Tomcat webapps ADD target/*.war /usr/local/tomcat/webapps # copy Java agent files from target to Tomcat NEWRELIC_HOME ADD target/newrelic ${NEWRELIC_HOME} # update Java agent yml with license_key and app_name and copy to image ADD newrelic.yml ${NEWRELIC_HOME} # update catalina.sh with -javaagent:/path/to/newrelic.jar and copy to image ADD catalina.sh /usr/local/tomcat/bin/ Copy 5. Build the Docker image To build a Docker image that runs Tomcat with the New Relic Java agent monitoring your deployed application WAR, run the following command. Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build -f Dockerfile -t newrelic-tomcat . Copy After running this command, verify that you have a Docker image named newrelic-tomcat. 6. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To open the app in the browser, run the following command: gcloud app browse Copy To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the APM Summary page. Recommendation: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in APM. To avoid adding additional instrumentation overhead and skewing throughput for your application, we recommend that you disable the health check. Recommendation: Configure your app.yaml to disable health checks by adding: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get Java agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an Instance.

      "body": "You can install the PHP agent on a Docker container or other container to monitor one or more of your PHP applications. This is supported for containers that meet PHP agent requirements. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values. Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

      "body": "You can install the PHP agent on a Docker container or other container to monitor one or more of your PHP applications. This is supported for containers that meet PHP agent requirements. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values. Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.

The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "You can install the PHP agent on a Docker container or other container to monitor one or more of your PHP applications. This is supported for containers that meet PHP agent requirements. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values. Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.

Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system.

Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "You can install the PHP agent on a Docker container or other container to monitor one or more of your PHP applications. This is supported for containers that meet PHP agent requirements. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values. Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "You can install the PHP agent on a Docker container or other container to monitor one or more of your PHP applications. This is supported for containers that meet PHP agent requirements. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values. Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.

      "body": "The interactive newrelic-install script simplifies installing PHP applications in New Relic. It works with multiple PHP installations as well as installations in non-standard locations. Running it will: Copy the correct PHP modules into place. Install sample ini files. Configure the New Relic proxy daemon. Important Be sure to review the information about working with multiple installations and non-standard locations before running the script. Find the installer script The installer script location depends on how you installed the New Relic PHP agent. Via system package manager: The installation script is in the /usr/bin directory. Via a tarball: The installation script is in the directory where you extracted the tar archive file. The script in the tar distribution includes installation steps otherwise handled by the package manager. Work with multiple PHP installations For newrelic-install to correctly detect multiple installations, ensure your PATH environment variable is correctly set. The newrelic-install script can only install the agent for versions it can find. If you want to... Do this... Specify additional directories Use the NR_INSTALL_PATH environment variable with a colon-separated list. Override NR_INSTALL_PATH and PATH Specify a set of directories in the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST environment variable as a colon-separated list. These directories must contain either the command line version of PHP or the php-config script. Invoke the installer script The script has two modes: install and uninstall. If you invoke it with no arguments, you will be prompted to select a mode. From the command line, run the script at its location: Via system package manager: /usr/bin/newrelic-install Via a tar archive directory: ./newrelic-install Use the install mode Follow this process to install New Relic. 1. Invoke install mode. Invoke install mode by using one of these methods: Run newrelic-install with the install command line option. Run newrelic-install with no options and select the install option from the main menu when invoking the script. 2. Provide your New Relic license key. At the prompt, enter your New Relic license key. This key will be inserted into any INI files created during the rest of the installation process. 3. Select which PHP version to use if applicable. If newrelic-install finds more than one version of PHP, select which version of PHP to use. You will not see this screen if the script only finds a single version of PHP. Example: The menu shows seven options: 1) /usr/bin 2) /usr/local/php/5.2.16/bin 3) /usr/local/php/5.2.16-zts/bin 4) /usr/local/php/5.3.4/bin 5) /usr/local/php/5.3.4-zts/bin 6) /usr/local/php/5.4.19-zts/bin 7) /usr/local/php/5.5.4-zts/bin 0) Exit Select (1-7, 0 to exit, or all): Copy ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. At the menu, use any of these options: To select only one version, enter the number indicating the version you want to use. To select multiple versions, enter a comma- or space-separated list of numbers. To select every version listed, enter the keyword all. To exit the installation process, Enter 0. For each directory selected, the script will attempt to install the agent in the proper place and report on each attempt. Important For PHP installations that allow multiple .ini files, the install script will copy a template file into place, if a modified one is not already installed. Make a note of the .ini files you will need to modify manually. As of PHP agent version 4.0, the installer will not work properly if it detects a single version of PHP 5.1, which is deprecated (2013). If you must run PHP 5.1, use PHP agent version 3.9.5.13. If you need help, get support at support.newrelic.com. 4. Install the daemon if applicable. If the daemon was not installed by the package manager, install the daemon. If this is an update or reinstall, the script provide a confirmation prompt before overwriting the old copy of the daemon. If installation is successful, the script will show this final message: New Relic is now installed on your system. Congratulations! Copy 5. Restart your web server. To activate the PHP agent, restart your web server. If you are running PHP-FPM, you may also need to restart PHP-FPM separately before the agent will be active. 6. Note your archive file. Note the name and location of the install archive file. This file will be located at /tmp/nrinstall-<var>nnnn</var>.tar and will contain both the install log and useful system information to help New Relic Technical Support with troubleshooting. 7. Fine-tune your configuration. After you install New Relic successfully and restart your web server, you can begin gathering data about your applications. After a few minutes, data will begin to appear on your APM Summary page. To fine-tune operation of both the PHP agent and daemon, review the PHP configuration options. Use the install_daemon mode To install the daemon without the agent, use PHP agent 9.2 or higher. Run newrelic-install with the install_daemon command line option. This is useful if the daemon runs on a different host or in a different container than the PHP application. For example, this may happen with agent install on containers. Troubleshoot your PHP installation If there were problems with the installation process, or if no data appears in the UI, review the PHP troubleshooting procedures before contacting New Relic for support. Be sure to attach your archive file to any bug report, as well as the output of the phpinfo() function produced by your web server. Uninstall mode You can uninstall New Relic but keep valuable config files (useful when upgrading), or permanently uninstall New Relic from your system. Uninstall and keep config files. This method is useful when you want to uninstall and upgrade. The uninstall does not remove important configuration files, such as your daemon configuration file. Also, it does not remove any newrelic.ini files that you have modified. To uninstall New Relic using the install script, use either of these options: Invoke newrelic-install with the uninstall option. Run newrelic-install with no options, and select the uninstall option from the main menu when invoking the script. Permanently uninstall New Relic. To permanently uninstall New Relic from your system: Invoke newrelic-install with the purge option. This will remove all the configuration files and any links created at installation time. This will not affect any configuration parameters placed in files such as php.in. Also, this will not remove the software packages installed on the system. To remove the New Relic software packages installed with a package manager, see Uninstalling RedHat and CentOS or Uninstalling Ubuntu and Debian.

      "body": "You can install the PHP agent on a Docker container or other container to monitor one or more of your PHP applications. This is supported for containers that meet PHP agent requirements. Container options The PHP agent requires two components to work: the PHP agent (one for each application) and a daemon, which aggregates data sent from one or more agents and sends it to New Relic. For this reason, there are two options for enabling the PHP agent for container environments: Install agent and daemon on different containers. This is the recommended setup. Install agent and daemon on the same container. This may be useful if you want to reduce your number of containers. Install agent and daemon in different containers Requirements: Meet PHP agent requirements PHP agent version 9.2 or higher To see an example application, go to New Relic's Explorers Hub. Caution Data transmitted from the agent to the daemon is not encrypted. The only exception to this is the SQL obfuscation that happens before sending data to the daemon. If the agent and daemon are running on different hosts, we recommend that you use a private network connection between the agent and daemon. Set up the daemon container If you use Docker, you can pull our daemon image from Docker Hub: Run this command: docker pull newrelic/php-daemon. To customize the image, follow the steps on Docker Hub. You can also build your own daemon image: To install the daemon, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install_daemon argument. Start the daemon using --address and --watchdog-foreground arguments. The --address argument sets a port for the daemon to accept connections. The --watchdog-foreground argument ensures that the daemon runs in the foreground. Set up the PHP agent container To set up the PHP agent container for Docker: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example, use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site, and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. In the newrelic.ini file, set the application name and license key with the newrelic.appname and newrelic.license entries . Point the agent to the daemon by setting the newrelic.daemon.address option in the newrelic.ini file. Make sure the value for this option is HOST:PORT, where HOST is the name or IP address of the host where the daemon is running, and PORT is the port number where the daemon is listening Install agent and daemon in the same container To set up the PHP agent and daemon in the same Docker container: Make sure a PHP installation is available in the container. For example: you might use a published Docker image like php:7.1. To install the agent, download the PHP agent package from New Relic's tar file download site and run the newrelic-install script with the install argument. Set the application name and license key via the newrelic.license and newrelic.appname entries in the newrelic.ini file. By default, the first transaction causes the agent to trigger a daemon start and an application connection initialization. However, for performance reasons, the agent does not wait for those operations to complete before it initializes the connection, which can result in the loss of the first few transactions after a container starts. To prevent this, set both newrelic.daemon.start_timeout and newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout entries in the newrelic.ini file to recommended values. Dockerfile example FROM php:7.1 RUN \\ curl -L PHP_AGENT_URL | tar -C /tmp -zx && \\ export NR_INSTALL_USE_CP_NOT_LN=1 && \\ export NR_INSTALL_SILENT=1 && \\ /tmp/newrelic-php5-*/newrelic-install install && \\ rm -rf /tmp/newrelic-php5-* /tmp/nrinstall* && \\ sed -i \\ -e 's/\"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\"/\"YOUR_LICENSE_KEY\"/' \\ -e 's/newrelic.appname = \"PHP Application\"/newrelic.appname = \"YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME\"/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout=15s/' \\ -e 's/;newrelic.daemon.start_timeout =.*/newrelic.daemon.start_timeout=5s/' \\ /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/newrelic.ini Copy You must edit three parts of this example Dockerfile: PHP_AGENT_URL: The download URL for your PHP agent version. To find the most recent version of the agent, go to download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. YOUR_LICENSE_KEY: Replace this with your New Relic license key. Note that \"REPLACE_WITH_REAL_KEY\" is an actual string in the default newrelic.ini file for the PHP agent. Don't edit that string. The sed command replaces that default string with the actual 40-character key, in quotes. YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME: Replace with the your application name, in quotes.

      "body": "Heroku is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution for hosting web applications in various languages, including PHP. With New Relic, you can extend Heroku with metrics from APM and browser monitoring. Prepare your application Before installing the PHP agent, make sure your PHP web application is installed and running under Heroku. For more information, see Getting Started with PHP on Heroku. Install the PHP agent After deploying your PHP app on Heroku, install our PHP agent: Via the Heroku website To install the New Relic add-on through the Heroku website: From the New Relic Add-on Page, select a subscription plan. From the Select an app dropdown, select your app. Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Via Heroku toolbelt To install the New Relic add-on with Heroku toolbelt: Via Heroku toolbelt, run the following command and substitute the appropriate subscription plan: heroku addons:create newrelic:YOUR_PLAN_LEVEL Copy Give your application a descriptive name with this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy Push a change to Heroku (for example, git commit --allow-empty) to enable the PHP extension during build. Generate some traffic to your app. Within a few minutes, data should start appearing in your APM Summary page. If no data appears, see the verification and troubleshooting procedures in this document. Configure the agent on Heroku Heroku automatically configures default environment variables for your app. To customize your settings, create and upload a newrelic.ini file to Heroku: Download a \"clean\" copy of newrelic.ini_.heroku [INI | 16KB] . Rename the file from newrelic.ini _ .heroku to newrelic.ini. Copy newrelic.ini to the root directory of your project repository. Customize your settings as described in PHP agent configuration. Caution Do not change newrelic.license, newrelic.loglevel, or newrelic.appname. These settings are configured by Heroku toolbelt. Commit your config file changes to your repository, and push your changes to Heroku. Instruct Heroku to use your customized config file via this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini Copy Name your application To ensure that metrics from each app are reported separately, give each app a descriptive name. Your application name defaults to PHP Application on Heroku. New Relic uses the app name to aggregate data. If you do not change this name, New Relic will aggregate the data from each additional PHP app you install under this same name. To name your application, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME='YOUR_APP_NAME' Copy To verify your app's name change, run: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME Copy Verify that the confirmation prompt returns the new app name: NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=YOUR_APP_NAME Copy Verify your installation To verify that Heroku has installed the New Relic add-on, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku run env | grep NEW_RELIC Copy This will generate a list of New Relic environment variables in Heroku. The agent uses these environment variables to determine which account to report data to. You should see at least the following variables: NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY='YOUR_LICENSE_KEY' NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=\"warning\" NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=\"YOUR_APP_NAME\" Copy You can also use phpinfo to verify that your app is being instrumented. Troubleshooting the agent on Heroku To troubleshoot the PHP agent on Heroku, examine your log file, which is stored in the Heroku web server log. To view the web server log, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku logs -t | tee newrelic.log Copy Use the log file to troubleshoot the issue. If you need further assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. The PHP agent defaults to the warning log level. New Relic Support may also request logs at the verbosedebug log level. To change the log level to verbosedebug, run this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:set NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL=verbosedebug Copy Caution The verbosedebug log level quickly generates a large volume of data. Use this setting only if New Relic Support requests it, and remove this setting as soon as you collect the output by running this Heroku toolbelt command: heroku config:unset NEW_RELIC_LOG_LEVEL Copy For more help Additional documentation resources include: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "If you are using a non-standard PHP installation, follow this procedure to properly install New Relic. This is common in instances where the default installer does not find your PHP installation (for example, if you have self-compiled PHP or a self-contained PHP stack). Important As part of the installation process, change the default application name to a meaningful name. Requirements Use the command line version of PHP (php -i) or look at the output of phpinfo() to determine: The PHP extension version (20090626, 20100525, 20121212, 20131226, 20151012, or 20160303) The extension or module installation directory Whether or not your version of PHP has been compiled with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) support ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. Use the command line newrelic-install script (recommended) Point New Relic at the right directory by using any of these options: Add your PHP location to your PATH The install script needs to be able to find your command line php or php-config. You can add the directory that contains those programs to your current PATH. Set the NR_INSTALL_PATH This can be a colon-separated list of directories for PHP installations in addition to those in your PATH. Make sure these directories contain php or php-config. For example: NR_INSTALL_PATH=/u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PATH newrelic-install Copy Set the NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST Optional: Use a colon-separated list to set the exact locations (directories) where to search. This option will ignore PATH and NR_INSTALL_PATH. For example: NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST=/usr/local/bin:u/php/5.3/bin; export NR_INSTALL_PHPLIST newrelic-install Copy Invoke the newrelic-install script from its directory. Depending on your server and your paths, the install script may find other versions of PHP on your system. Select your specific version from the list. For more information, see PHP install script. Install New Relic manually If you do not want to use the install script, you can perform a fully manual installation. Be sure to gather information about your PHP installation. You can review and obtain the appropriate values from your phpinfo(). Then create and link or copy the files into place manually. Get installation parameters from phpinfo() If this process doesn't work for you, you can get the correct information from your phpinfo() and pass the appropriate settings to your system as environment variables. phpinfo() Notes PHPAPI This is labeled PHP Extension in the phpinfo() header. ARCH This can be determined by executing file /path/to/php. If you see a reference to ELF-32, then the ARCH is x86. If you see a reference to ELF-64, then the ARCH is x64. MODULEDIR This is labeled extension_dir in the PHP Core section. PHPZTS ZTS options apply only to PHP agent versions 9.17 and earlier. ZTS is not available for PHP versions 9.18 or higher. To determine whether ZTS is compiled in, look for the Thread Safety setting at the top of the phpinfo() output. If this is disabled, then PHPZTS is empty. If this is enabled, then PHPZTS is the string -zts, which includes a leading hyphen as noted. NRBASEDIR This is the base directory of the New Relic agent installation directory; for example, /usr/lib/newrelic-php5 or the directory where you extracted the tar file for tarball installations. Use this information to execute the following commands to install the PHP module. Be sure to adjust the example's values to your actual settings. NRBASEDIR=/usr/lib/newrelic-php5; export NRBASEDIR MODULEDIR=/usr/lib/php/modules; export MODULEDIR ARCH=x64; export ARCH PHPAPI=20090626; export PHPAPI PHPZTS=\"-zts\"; export PHPZTS rm -f $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so ln -s $NRBASEDIR/agent/$ARCH/newrelic-${PHPAPI}${PHPZTS}.so \\ $MODULEDIR/newrelic.so Copy Manual configuration The next step is configuration. Copy the $NRBASEDIR/scripts/newrelic.ini.template to the directory from where your PHP installation reads additional config files and rename it newrelic.ini. To determine the destination, look at your phpinfo() output for the item, called Scan this dir for additional .ini files. If the directory listed is (none), add settings from this file to your listed PHP config files (usually php.ini). Replace the license key setting in your newrelic.ini file with your license key. Also change any other sessions as needed (for example, newrelic.appname). Copy $NRBASEDIR/daemon/newrelic-daemon.$architecture to /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon. Depending on your system, $architecture will be either x86 or x64. Restart your dispatcher/web server. Verify that your site is functioning properly. If it isn't, remove newrelic.ini or the newrelic.so you created, and restart your dispatcher/web server again to restore the old operation. Examine your web server/dispatcher logfiles (not newrelic) to help determine the issue. If you still need assistance, get support at support.newrelic.com. Verify installation Check that the agent is installed after the restart, by investigating the phpinfo() page for a newrelic section. If it appears the agent was successfully installed, check your system to verify that two newrelic-daemon processes are running: For RedHat based systems: ps -aef | grep newrelic-daemon Copy For Debian based systems: ps aux | grep newrelic-daemon Copy Generate some traffic on your app, then wait for three to five minutes for results to arrive in your APM Summary page.

Requirements Agent version 2.6 or higher. Caution If you include an exception ($e), there are differences depending on the PHP version you are using: PHP version 5 or lower: You must pass a valid PHP Exception class. PHP version 7 or higher: You must pass a valid PHP Throwable interface. Description The PHP agent handles PHP errors and exceptions automatically for supported frameworks. If you want to collect errors that are not handled automatically so that you can query for those errors in New Relic and view error traces, you can use newrelic_notice_error. If you want to use your own error and exception handlers, you can set newrelic_notice_error as the callback.

Set the callback for your own error and exception handler To use your own handler, use these calls to make sure that the PHP agent notices the errors and exceptions from within your handler. set_exception_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_exception_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy set_error_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_error_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameters This function can handle a variable number of parameters. You can pass-in 1 or 5 parameters, depending on your use case. newrelic_notice_error(string $message) Copy Parameter Description $message string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Parameter Description $e exception Required. Defaults to null. The agent uses Exception or Throwable to capture the stack frame and set the error class to the exception class name. If null or omitted, the agent reports an \"exception\" in the same format created by Exception::__toString. newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameter Description $errno integer Required.

      "body": "New Relic offers several tools to help obtain the information needed to provide useful metrics about your Node.js application. These include: Reading the route names (if used) from the Express and Restify routers Using the API to name the current request, either with simple names or groups of controllers with actions Support rules that are stored in your agent's configuration that can mark requests to be renamed or ignored based on regular expressions matched against the request's raw URLs (also available as API calls) The number of names that New Relic tracks needs to be small enough so that the user experience is robust. It also needs to be large enough to provide the right amount of information (without overwhelming you with data) so that you can identify problem spots in your applications more easily. For more information, see the Node.js agent configuration documentation and the Node.js agent API documentation on Github. Request names The Node.js agent captures the HTTP method along with a potentially parameterized path (such as /user/:id) or a regular expression (such as /^/user/([-0-9a-f]+)$/). These pieces of information become part of the request name. If you have support for slow transaction traces and have enabled capture_params in your config file, the transaction trace will also have the request's parameters and their values attached to it. If you are dissatisfied with the request names that the Node.js agent uses, you can use API calls to create more descriptive names. Tip If grouping your requests under the generic name, then /* is sufficient, and you do not need to customize your configuration file or API calls. Requirements New Relic uses request names to group requests for many charts and tables. The value of these visualizations will drop as the number of different request names increases. For example, do not include potentially dynamic data like GUIDs, numerical IDs, or timestamps in the request names you create. If your request is slow enough to generate a transaction trace, that trace will contain the original URL. If you enable parameter capture, the parameters will also be attached to the trace. Tip Avoid having more than 50 different transaction names. For example, if you have more than a couple hundred different request names, rethink your naming strategy. Avoid metric grouping issues The request naming API helps New Relic avoid problems with trying to handle too many metrics, which sometimes is referred to as \"metric explosion.\" New Relic has several strategies to deal with these issues; the most severe is simply to add offending applications to your deny list. The main reason for you to be careful in using these request-naming tools is to prevent that from happening to your applications. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. Guidelines Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general. The first rules listed in your config file or added with the Node.js transaction naming API will be applied first and should be narrowly targeted. More general \"fall-through\" rules should be added toward the end of the list, because they will be evaluated in the order they were configured or added using the Node.js transaction naming API. URL pattern matching An online retailer has a URL pattern like this: /user/customers/all/prospects /user/customers/all/current /user/customers/all/returning /user/customers/John /user/customers/Jane Copy The retailer could create rules like this: // newrelic.js exports.config={ //other configuration rules:{ name:[ { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/prospects/\", name: \"/user/customers/all/prospects\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/all\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/:customer\" } ] } } Copy With these rules, the retailer would create three transaction names: /user/customers/:customer /user/customers/all /user/customers/all/prospects If the retailer reversed the order, the rules would catch all transactions in :customer, which would not be as useful. Load the request naming API Make sure that loading the New Relic module is the first thing your application does, as it needs to bootstrap itself before the rest of your application loads: var newrelic = require('newrelic'); Copy This returns the request naming API. You can safely require the module from multiple modules in your application, as it only initializes itself once. Request API calls Here is a summary of the Request API calls for New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.setTransactionName(name) newrelic.setTransactionName(name) Copy Name the current request, following the request naming requirements. You can call this function anywhere within the context of an HTTP request handler, at any time after handling of the request has started, but before the request has finished. In general, if the request and response objects are in scope, you can set the name. Explicitly calling newrelic.setTransactionName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. newrelic.setControllerName(name, \\[action]) newrelic.setControllerName(name, \\[action]) Copy Name the current request using a controller-style pattern, optionally including the current controller action. If the action is omitted, New Relic will include the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) as the action. The rules for when you can call newrelic.setControllerName() are the same as they are for newrelic.setTransactionName(), including the request naming requirements. Explicitly calling newrelic.setControllerName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. Custom instrumentation API calls Use these API calls to expand your instrumentation with custom instrumentation. newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a specific module. The provided onRequire callback will be fired when the given module is loaded with require. The moduleName parameter should be the string that will be passed to require; for example, 'express' or 'amqplib/callback_api'. The optional onError callback is called if the onRequire parameters throws an error. This is useful for debugging your instrumentation. Use this method to: Add instrumentation for modules not currently instrumented by New Relic. Instrument your own code. Replace the Node.js agent's built-in instrumentation with your own. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a datastore module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a datastore-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js datastore instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) Copy The instrumentLoadedModule method allows you to add stock instrumentation to specific modules in situations where it's impossible to have require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. // load the agent const newrelic = require('newrelic') // module loaded before newrelic const expressModule = require('express') // instrument express _after_ the agent has been loaded newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule( 'express', // the module's name, as a string expressModule // the module instance ); Copy Important This method cannot instrument any arbitrary module. Its purpose is to add modules that were missed because the agent was not loaded as the first thing in your program. The instrumentLoadedModule method can only instrument modules the agent would normally instrument. You can see a list of these modules in the agent's lib/instrumentations module. newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a message service client module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a message-service-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js message service instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a web framework module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a web-framework-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js web framework instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) Copy Instrument the specified web transaction. Using this API call, you can instrument transactions that New Relic does not automatically detect. The url defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The handle defines the function you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startWebTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, \\[group], handle) newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, \\[group], handle) Copy Instrument the specified background transaction. Using this API call, you can expand New Relic's instrumentation to capture data from background transactions. The name defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The group is optional, and it allows you to group similar jobs together via the transaction type in the user interface. Like name, the group needs to be static. The handle defines a function that includes the entire background job you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.getTransaction() Copy Returns a handle on the currently executing transaction. This handle can then be used to interact with a given transaction safely from any context. It is best used with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Please refer to the transaction handle section for more details. newrelic.endTransaction() newrelic.endTransaction() Copy End the current web or background custom transaction. This method requires being in the correct transaction context when called. This API call takes no arguments. newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) Copy Instrument a particular method to improve visibility into a transaction, or optionally turn it into a metric. The name defines a name for the segment. This name will be visible in transaction traces and as a new metric in the New Relic UI. The record flag defines whether the segment should be recorded as a metric. The handler is the function you want to track as a segment. The optional callback is a function passed to the handler to fire after its work is done. The agent begins timing the segment when startSegment is called. The segment is ended when either the handler finishes executing, or callback is fired, if it is provided. Custom metrics API calls Use these API calls to record additional arbitrary metrics: newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) Copy Use recordMetric to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The name must be a string following standard metric naming rules. The value will usually be a number, but it can also be an object. When value is a numeric value, it should represent the magnitude of a measurement associated with an event; for example, the duration for a particular method call. When value is an object, it must contain count, total, min, max, and sumOfSquares keys, all with number values. This form is useful to aggregate metrics on your own and report them periodically; for example, from a setInterval. These values will be aggregated with any previously collected values for the same metric. The names of these keys match the names of the keys used by the platform API. newrelic.incrementMetric(name, \\[amount]) newrelic.incrementMetric(name, \\[amount]) Copy Use incrementMetric to update a metric that acts as a simple counter. The count of the selected metric will be incremented by the specified amount, defaulting to 1. Custom events API calls Use these API calls to record additional events: newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. Recording a custom event The following example demonstrates recording a custom event with multiple attributes. const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.recordCustomEvent('MessagingEvent', attributes) Copy Transaction handle methods This section details the methods provided by the TransactionHandle class instance that can be obtained through newrelic.getTransaction(). Use these methods to interact directly with the current transaction: transactionHandle.end(\\[callback]) transactionHandle.end(\\[callback]) Copy Use transactionHandle.end to end the transaction referenced by the handle instance. The callback is invoked when the transaction has fully ended. The finished transaction passed to the callback as the first argument. transactionHandle.ignore() transactionHandle.ignore() Copy Use transactionHandle.ignore to ignore the transaction referenced by the handle instance. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call acceptDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders is used to implement distributed tracing. It modifies the headers map that is passed in by adding W3C Trace Context headers and New Relic Distributed Trace headers. The New Relic headers can be disabled with distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header: true in the config. This method replaces the deprecated createDistributedTracePayload method, which only creates New Relic Distributed Trace payloads. Generating distributed trace headers In the following example, by calling insertDistributedTraceHeaders with an empty object, the appropriate Distributed Trace headers and W3C Trace Context headers will be generated for the transaction. // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // This could be a header object from an incoming request as well const headersObject = {} newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // generate the headers transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call insertDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting a payload generated by insertDistributedTraceHeaders or generated by some other W3C Trace Context compliant tracer. This method accepts the headers of an incoming request, looks for W3C Trace Context headers, and if not found, falls back to New Relic distributed trace headers. This method replaces the deprecated (and now removed as of version 7.0.0) acceptDistributedTracePayload method, which only handles New Relic distributed trace payloads. transportType should be one of the following strings: AMQP HTTP HTTPS IronMQ JMS Kafka Other Queue Unknown headers should be an object containing all the headers in the incoming request. The keys must be lowercase. Accept incoming distributed trace headers The following example demonstrates adding distributed trace headers retrieved from a Kafka message. In this example, we assume that the incoming Kafka message has Distributed Trace headers inserted. // incoming Kafka message headers const headersObject = message.headers // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // accept the headers transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders('Kafka', headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use insertDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For instructions on how to use this call, along with its partner call acceptDistributedTracePayload, see Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. This call is used to implement distributed tracing. It generates a payload that is read by the receiving application with acceptDistributedTracePayload. Important Note: In order to maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, you must generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. The DistributedTracePayload object has two available methods used for generating the payload in different formats: DistributedTracePayload#text: returns a JSON representation of the payload. Link a nested background transaction // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() var jsonPayload = payload.text() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { var backgroundHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // Link the nested transaction by accepting the payload with the background transaction's handle backgroundHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(jsonPayload) }) Copy DistributedTracePayload#httpSafe: returns a base64 encoded JSON representation of the payload. Place payload on an outgoing request // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() // Place the base64 encoded value on an outbound request header. req.headers[myTracingHeader] = payload.httpSafe() Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use acceptDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call createDistributedTracePayload, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting the payload generated by createDistributedTracePayload. transactionHandle.isSampled() transactionHandle.isSampled() Copy Returns whether this trace is being sampled. Other API calls New Relic's Node.js agent includes additional API calls. newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom attribute value to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in APM's transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Add custom attribute newrelic.addCustomAttribute('attribute1', 'value1') Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in the transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Adding custom attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom span attribute value to be displayed along with a transaction trace span in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attribute newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute('attribute1', 'value') Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom span attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace spans in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 'value2' } newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() Copy Returns the HTML snippet to be inserted into the header of HTML pages to enable browser monitoring. The HTML will instruct the browser to fetch a small JavaScript file and start the page timer. newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) Copy Tell the module whether or not to ignore a given request. This allows you to explicitly filter long-polling, irrelevant routes or requests you know will be time-consuming. This also allows you to gather metrics for requests that otherwise would be ignored. To ignore the transaction, set the parameter to true will ignore the transaction. To prevent a transaction from being ignored with this function, pass the parameter false. Passing null or undefined will not change whether the transaction is ignored. Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0. Please use transactionHandle.ignore() newrelic.noticeError(error, \\[customParameters]) newrelic.noticeError(error, \\[customParameters]) Copy Use this call if your app is doing its own error handling with domains or try/catch clauses, but you want all of the information about how many errors are coming out of the app to be centrally managed. Unlike other Node.js calls, this can be used outside of route handlers, but it will have additional context if called from within transaction scope. Caution Errors recorded using this method do not obey the ignore_status_codes configuration value. newrelic.shutdown(\\[options], callback) newrelic.shutdown(\\[options], callback) Copy Use this method to gracefully shut down the agent. options options.collectPendingData - type boolean - Tell the agent whether to send any pending data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. options.timeout - type number (ms) - The default time before forcing a shutdown. When collectPendingData is true, the agent will wait for a connection before shutting down. This timeout is useful for short lived processes, like AWS Lambda, in order to keep the process from staying open too long, while trying to connect. Example: newrelic.shutdown({collectPendingData: true, timeout: 3000}, (error) => { process.exit() }) Copy newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() Copy Returns key/value pairs which can be used to link traces or entities. It will only contain items with meaningful values. For instance, if distributed tracing is disabled, trace.id will not be included. newrelic.getTraceMetadata() newrelic.getTraceMetadata() Copy Returns and object containing the current trace ID and span ID. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled or an empty object will be returned. Rules for naming and ignoring requests If you do not want to put calls to the New Relic module directly into your application code, you can use pattern-based rules to name requests. There are two sets of rules: one for renaming requests, and one to mark requests to be ignored by New Relic's instrumentation. Here is the structure for rules in New Relic's Node.js agent. rules.name A list of rules of the format {pattern : \"pattern\", name : \"name\"} for matching incoming request URLs to pattern and naming the matching New Relic transaction's name. This acts as a regex replace, where you can set the pattern either as a string, or as a JavaScript regular expression literal, and both pattern and name are required. When passing a regex as a string, escape backslashes, as the agent does not keep them when given as a string in a pattern. Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general, as the patterns will be evaluated in order and are terminal in nature. For more information, see the naming guidelines. This can also be set with the environment variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy Optional rules attributes [#optional-rules] Additional optional attributes are available: Optional rules attributes Description terminate_chain Default: true When set to true (default), no further rules will be evaluated if this rule is a match. Setting this to false is useful when multiple rules should be used together. For example, one rule could be replacing a common pattern in many different URLs, while subsequent rule(s) would be more specific. replace_all Default: false When set to true, all matches of the pattern will be replaced. Otherwise, only the first match will be replaced. Using the g flag with regular expression literal will have the same effect. For example: pattern: '[0-9]+', replace_all: true Copy This has the same effect as pattern: /[0-9]+/g. precedence By default the rules are evaluated in order, from first to last. If you prefer to have complete control over the order, you can give each rule a precedence attribute. The precedence is an integer number, and rules are evaluated in ascending order. If precedence is not explicitly defined, it will be set to 500 by default. Additional attributes are ignored. Testing your naming rules [#testing-rules] The Node.js agent comes with a command-line tool for testing naming rules. For more information, run the following command in terminal window in a directory where your app is installed: node node_modules/.bin/newrelic-naming-rules Copy Naming rule examples [#examples-rules] Here are some examples of naming rules and the results. Match full URL pattern: \"^/items/[0-9]+$\", name: \"/items/:id\" Copy will result in: /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123 => /orders/123 (not replaced since the rule is a full match) Copy Replace first match in URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\" Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/123 Copy Replace all matches in any URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\", replace_all: true Copy will result in: /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/:id Copy Match group references Using regular expression match group references: pattern: '^/(items|orders)/[0-9]+$', name: '/\\\\1/:id' Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id Copy rules.ignore This can also be set via the environment variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited patterns. Currently there is no way to escape commas in patterns. NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES='^/socket\\.io/\\*/xhr-polling,ignore_me' Copy Here are full examples of how rules are included in the configuration file: Naming rule example // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { name : [ { pattern: \"/tables/name-here\", name: \"/name-hererule1\" } ] } Copy Ignoring rule example If you are using socket.io, you will have a use case for ignoring rules right out of the box. To keep socket.io long-polling from dominating your response-time metrics and affecting the Apdex metrics for your application, add a rule such as: // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { ignore : [ '^\\/socket\\.io\\/.*\\/xhr-polling' ] } }; Copy API calls for rules Here are the API calls for naming and ignoring rules with New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.addNamingRule(pattern, name) Programmatic version of rules.name. Once naming rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. Both parameters are required. newrelic.addIgnoringRule(pattern) Programmatic version of rules.ignore. Once ignoring rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. This parameter is required.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 6 or higher Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5.

Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Joomla 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

      "body": "Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. You can view these key-value pairs in some places in the UI, or by querying that data using NRQL. New Relic gives users the ability to customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. You can also collect custom attributes to send additional data to New Relic. Attribute destination flow This diagram illustrates how an agent decides to send attributes to each destination. Agent attribute collection: An agent makes three different decisions when sending an attribute to any New Relic destination based on the relevant property settings. Property names and syntax vary by agent. (The properties in this diagram are specific to the PHP agent, but the general flow is the same for all agents. Property names and syntax vary by agent.) Types of attributes Attributes can be collected in a variety of ways: Message property attributes: These are the properties set on a message received from a queue or topic. HTTP request attributes: These are the parameters for an HTTP request. User attributes: These are attributes provided by the user through each agent's API. Agent attributes: These are attributes captured by the agent; for example, httpResponseCode and httpResponseMessage. Destinations for attributes Collected attributes appear in these locations: Collected attributes Location Transaction traces Each minute transaction traces collect data for your slowest individual HTTP requests. These traces will report attributes collected during the transaction. Traced errors If a transaction results in an error, these traced errors will be reported to APM. A traced error will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Transaction events APM transactions will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Insights page views Browser page views will contain attributes collected during the transaction. However, attributes collected at the end of a transaction may not appear on PageView events. This destination is also called browser monitoring. Span events Span events collected for distributed tracing will contain attributes collected during the span. The following agents support the addition of custom user attributes to span events: Java agent 5.13.0 and above Go agent 3.6.0 and above .NET agent 8.25 and above Node agent 6.10.0 and above PHP agent 9.12.0.268 and above Python agent 5.8.0.136 and above Ruby agent 6.8.0 and above Transaction segments Each segment in a transaction trace will contain attributes recorded for that segment. Viewing request attributes Request attributes are associated with specific transaction traces, browser traces, and errors in APM and dashboards. You can see the attributes recorded with a request when viewing the individual trace or error. Custom attributes can be queried via NRQL exactly like any other attribute. APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size. Parameter Limitations Transaction Limited to 64 user attributes Attribute key Limited to 256 bytes each If the key is more than 256 bytes, then the attribute will not be recorded. Attribute value Limited to 256 bytes each If the value is greater than 256 bytes, then the attribute value will be truncated. Agent-specific attributes Each APM agent collects custom attributes. The supported attributes depend on the specific agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby",

Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true.

Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection.

      "body": "Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. You can view these key-value pairs in some places in the UI, or by querying that data using NRQL. New Relic gives users the ability to customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. You can also collect custom attributes to send additional data to New Relic. Attribute destination flow This diagram illustrates how an agent decides to send attributes to each destination. Agent attribute collection: An agent makes three different decisions when sending an attribute to any New Relic destination based on the relevant property settings. Property names and syntax vary by agent. (The properties in this diagram are specific to the PHP agent, but the general flow is the same for all agents. Property names and syntax vary by agent.) Types of attributes Attributes can be collected in a variety of ways: Message property attributes: These are the properties set on a message received from a queue or topic. HTTP request attributes: These are the parameters for an HTTP request. User attributes: These are attributes provided by the user through each agent's API. Agent attributes: These are attributes captured by the agent; for example, httpResponseCode and httpResponseMessage. Destinations for attributes Collected attributes appear in these locations: Collected attributes Location Transaction traces Each minute transaction traces collect data for your slowest individual HTTP requests. These traces will report attributes collected during the transaction. Traced errors If a transaction results in an error, these traced errors will be reported to APM. A traced error will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Transaction events APM transactions will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Insights page views Browser page views will contain attributes collected during the transaction. However, attributes collected at the end of a transaction may not appear on PageView events. This destination is also called browser monitoring. Span events Span events collected for distributed tracing will contain attributes collected during the span. The following agents support the addition of custom user attributes to span events: Java agent 5.13.0 and above Go agent 3.6.0 and above .NET agent 8.25 and above Node agent 6.10.0 and above PHP agent 9.12.0.268 and above Python agent 5.8.0.136 and above Ruby agent 6.8.0 and above Transaction segments Each segment in a transaction trace will contain attributes recorded for that segment. Viewing request attributes Request attributes are associated with specific transaction traces, browser traces, and errors in APM and dashboards. You can see the attributes recorded with a request when viewing the individual trace or error. Custom attributes can be queried via NRQL exactly like any other attribute. APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size. Parameter Limitations Transaction Limited to 64 user attributes Attribute key Limited to 256 bytes each If the key is more than 256 bytes, then the attribute will not be recorded. Attribute value Limited to 256 bytes each If the value is greater than 256 bytes, then the attribute value will be truncated. Agent-specific attributes Each APM agent collects custom attributes. The supported attributes depend on the specific agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby",

      "body": "Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. You can view these key-value pairs in some places in the UI, or by querying that data using NRQL. New Relic gives users the ability to customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. You can also collect custom attributes to send additional data to New Relic. Attribute destination flow This diagram illustrates how an agent decides to send attributes to each destination. Agent attribute collection: An agent makes three different decisions when sending an attribute to any New Relic destination based on the relevant property settings. Property names and syntax vary by agent. (The properties in this diagram are specific to the PHP agent, but the general flow is the same for all agents. Property names and syntax vary by agent.) Types of attributes Attributes can be collected in a variety of ways: Message property attributes: These are the properties set on a message received from a queue or topic. HTTP request attributes: These are the parameters for an HTTP request. User attributes: These are attributes provided by the user through each agent's API. Agent attributes: These are attributes captured by the agent; for example, httpResponseCode and httpResponseMessage. Destinations for attributes Collected attributes appear in these locations: Collected attributes Location Transaction traces Each minute transaction traces collect data for your slowest individual HTTP requests. These traces will report attributes collected during the transaction. Traced errors If a transaction results in an error, these traced errors will be reported to APM. A traced error will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Transaction events APM transactions will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Insights page views Browser page views will contain attributes collected during the transaction. However, attributes collected at the end of a transaction may not appear on PageView events. This destination is also called browser monitoring. Span events Span events collected for distributed tracing will contain attributes collected during the span. The following agents support the addition of custom user attributes to span events: Java agent 5.13.0 and above Go agent 3.6.0 and above .NET agent 8.25 and above Node agent 6.10.0 and above PHP agent 9.12.0.268 and above Python agent 5.8.0.136 and above Ruby agent 6.8.0 and above Transaction segments Each segment in a transaction trace will contain attributes recorded for that segment. Viewing request attributes Request attributes are associated with specific transaction traces, browser traces, and errors in APM and dashboards. You can see the attributes recorded with a request when viewing the individual trace or error. Custom attributes can be queried via NRQL exactly like any other attribute. APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size. Parameter Limitations Transaction Limited to 64 user attributes Attribute key Limited to 256 bytes each If the key is more than 256 bytes, then the attribute will not be recorded. Attribute value Limited to 256 bytes each If the value is greater than 256 bytes, then the attribute value will be truncated. Agent-specific attributes Each APM agent collects custom attributes. The supported attributes depend on the specific agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby",

Attribute rules New Relic follows these rules when determining which attributes to include or exclude for a destination. Root level takes precedence for enabled. The newrelic.attributes.enabled field trumps all other settings. When false, no attributes will be reported to New Relic. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = foo,bar newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = true Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, foo, bar, bat Keys included for all destinations: Keys excluded for all destinations: password, foo, bar, bat Copy Destination enabled takes precedence over include and exclude. newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled flags take precedence over include and exclude keys. Example configuration: newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled = false newrelic.attributes.include = one,two newrelic.transaction_tracer.attributes.include = three,four Copy Example output: Keys passed in: one, two, three, four Keys included for transaction traces: Keys excluded for transaction traces: one, two, three, four Copy Attribute is included if the destination is enabled. If a destination is enabled, all user attributes are sent to that destination by default. All user attributes default to true. However, by default, request attributes and message parameters are disabled for all destinations. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = myAttKey Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, bar, myAttKey Keys included: foo, bar Keys excluded: myAttKey Copy Exclude always supersedes include. If the same key is listed in the include and exclude lists, then attributes with the specified key will be excluded. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = foo,myCustomAtt newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,myCustomAtt Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.exclude = password,PaSsWoRd Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use a star (\\*) for wildcards. You can use an asterisk or star (*) at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match a set of attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = custom* newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.enabled = true newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.foo newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.* Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: newrelic.attributes.include = foo newrelic.transaction_events.attributes.exclude = foo Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Deprecated properties The following properties have been deprecated. Switch to the new attributes configuration for these properties when upgrading your PHP agent. Deprecated property New property newrelic.capture_params newrelic.attributes.include = request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the newrelic.attributes.include list to turn on all request parameters. The newrelic.capture_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.ignored_params newrelic.attributes.exclude = request.parameters.{name} Add each request parameter key to the newrelic.attributes.exclude list, delimited by commas. Be sure to prepend the key with request.parameters. The newrelic.ignored_params property has been deprecated. newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled The old newrelic.{destination}.capture_attributes flag would turn off user attribute collection. This has been deprecated. Use newrelic.{destination}.attributes.enabled instead.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 6 or higher Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. Debian 7.0 (\"wheezy\") or higher Ubuntu LTS 14.04 (\"Trusty Tahr\") or higher or Ubuntu non-LTS 19.04 (\"Disco Dingo\") or higher. Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Joomla 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

Requirements Agent version 2.6 or higher. Caution If you include an exception ($e), there are differences depending on the PHP version you are using: PHP version 5 or lower: You must pass a valid PHP Exception class. PHP version 7 or higher: You must pass a valid PHP Throwable interface. Description The PHP agent handles PHP errors and exceptions automatically for supported frameworks. If you want to collect errors that are not handled automatically so that you can query for those errors in New Relic and view error traces, you can use newrelic_notice_error. If you want to use your own error and exception handlers, you can set newrelic_notice_error as the callback. Collect errors that are not handled automatically To collect errors that the PHP agent does not handle automatically, such as non-PHP errors, add this call to the function that you want to report on: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Important When there are multiple calls to this function in a single transaction, the PHP agent retains the exception from the last call only. Set the callback for your own error and exception handler To use your own handler, use these calls to make sure that the PHP agent notices the errors and exceptions from within your handler. set_exception_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_exception_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy set_error_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_error_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameters This function can handle a variable number of parameters. You can pass-in 1 or 5 parameters, depending on your use case. newrelic_notice_error(string $message) Copy Parameter Description $message string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Parameter Description $e exception Required. Defaults to null. The agent uses Exception or Throwable to capture the stack frame and set the error class to the exception class name. If null or omitted, the agent reports an \"exception\" in the same format created by Exception::__toString. newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameter Description $errno integer Required. The predefined level of the error, expressed as an integer. $errstr string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. $errfile string Optional. The name of the file that the error occurred in. $errline integer Optional. The line number where the error occurred. $errcontext string Optional. An array that points to the symbol table that was active when the error occurred. Return values Returns null regardless of result. Examples Collect errors that are not handled automatically Track errors that aren't reported automatically or that aren't PHP errors. In this example, an error is sent to the PHP agent if an unknown user accesses your app. try { //Add your code that may throw an error here. } catch (UserNotFoundException $e) { newrelic_notice_error($e); //Handle normally. } Copy Report exceptions from your own exception handler Make the PHP agent notice exceptions from within your own exception handler. function example_exception_handler($ex) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error($ex); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.6 or higher) PHP version 5.6 or higher: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error(...func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.5 or lower) PHP version 5.5 or lower: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { call_user_func_array('newrelic_notice_error', func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Requirements Agent version 2.6 or higher. Caution If you include an exception ($e), there are differences depending on the PHP version you are using: PHP version 5 or lower: You must pass a valid PHP Exception class. PHP version 7 or higher: You must pass a valid PHP Throwable interface. Description The PHP agent handles PHP errors and exceptions automatically for supported frameworks. If you want to collect errors that are not handled automatically so that you can query for those errors in New Relic and view error traces, you can use newrelic_notice_error. If you want to use your own error and exception handlers, you can set newrelic_notice_error as the callback. Collect errors that are not handled automatically To collect errors that the PHP agent does not handle automatically, such as non-PHP errors, add this call to the function that you want to report on: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Important When there are multiple calls to this function in a single transaction, the PHP agent retains the exception from the last call only. Set the callback for your own error and exception handler To use your own handler, use these calls to make sure that the PHP agent notices the errors and exceptions from within your handler. set_exception_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_exception_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy set_error_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_error_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameters This function can handle a variable number of parameters. You can pass-in 1 or 5 parameters, depending on your use case. newrelic_notice_error(string $message) Copy Parameter Description $message string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Parameter Description $e exception Required. Defaults to null. The agent uses Exception or Throwable to capture the stack frame and set the error class to the exception class name. If null or omitted, the agent reports an \"exception\" in the same format created by Exception::__toString. newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameter Description $errno integer Required. The predefined level of the error, expressed as an integer. $errstr string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. $errfile string Optional. The name of the file that the error occurred in. $errline integer Optional. The line number where the error occurred. $errcontext string Optional. An array that points to the symbol table that was active when the error occurred. Return values Returns null regardless of result. Examples Collect errors that are not handled automatically Track errors that aren't reported automatically or that aren't PHP errors. In this example, an error is sent to the PHP agent if an unknown user accesses your app. try { //Add your code that may throw an error here. } catch (UserNotFoundException $e) { newrelic_notice_error($e); //Handle normally. } Copy Report exceptions from your own exception handler Make the PHP agent notice exceptions from within your own exception handler. function example_exception_handler($ex) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error($ex); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.6 or higher) PHP version 5.6 or higher: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error(...func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.5 or lower) PHP version 5.5 or lower: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { call_user_func_array('newrelic_notice_error', func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Depending on the language agent, available settings may include: Transaction tracing SQL recording and logging SQL query plans Error collection Thread profiling Distributed tracing Cross application tracing Centralization and security Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic UI. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change automatically applies to all APM agents, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings not available from the UI. Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly within the New Relic UI, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you utilize environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls. Also, server-side configuration is not supported. However, you can change the app name from the UI or from the C SDK configuration settings. Go hierarchy Java hierarchy .NET hierarchy Node.js hierarchy PHP hierarchy (server-side configuration not supported) Python hierarchy Ruby hierarchy Enable server-side configuration The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To enable server-side configuration settings for apps that use other New Relic agents: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. After you enable server-side configuration, you can view and change the available settings through the UI. View or change server-side configuration settings If you use server-side configuration, you must still include your license_key and app_name in the local config file. These settings are required for the agent to communicate with the New Relic collector. The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To view or change the available server-side configuration settings through the UI for apps that use other New Relic agents: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. Once you set any of these options from the UI, they will override any conflicting options in the agent's configuration file. Disable server-side configuration Once you enable server-side configuration for an account, server-side configuration cannot be turned off without assistance from New Relic Support. This helps mitigate issues that could arise from conflicts with configuration settings if you need to transition back to a local configuration setup.",

Depending on the language agent, available settings may include: Transaction tracing SQL recording and logging SQL query plans Error collection Thread profiling Distributed tracing Cross application tracing Centralization and security Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic UI. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change automatically applies to all APM agents, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings not available from the UI. Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly within the New Relic UI, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you utilize environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls. Also, server-side configuration is not supported. However, you can change the app name from the UI or from the C SDK configuration settings. Go hierarchy Java hierarchy .NET hierarchy Node.js hierarchy PHP hierarchy (server-side configuration not supported) Python hierarchy Ruby hierarchy Enable server-side configuration The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To enable server-side configuration settings for apps that use other New Relic agents: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. After you enable server-side configuration, you can view and change the available settings through the UI. View or change server-side configuration settings If you use server-side configuration, you must still include your license_key and app_name in the local config file. These settings are required for the agent to communicate with the New Relic collector. The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To view or change the available server-side configuration settings through the UI for apps that use other New Relic agents: Go to one.newrelic.com and click APM. Click on your app. Then click Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. Once you set any of these options from the UI, they will override any conflicting options in the agent's configuration file. Disable server-side configuration Once you enable server-side configuration for an account, server-side configuration cannot be turned off without assistance from New Relic Support. This helps mitigate issues that could arise from conflicts with configuration settings if you need to transition back to a local configuration setup.",

      "body": "Before you install New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 6 or higher Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. Debian 7.0 (\"wheezy\") or higher Ubuntu LTS 14.04 (\"Trusty Tahr\") or higher or Ubuntu non-LTS 19.04 (\"Disco Dingo\") or higher. Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Joomla 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 6 or higher Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. Debian 7.0 (\"wheezy\") or higher Ubuntu LTS 14.04 (\"Trusty Tahr\") or higher or Ubuntu non-LTS 19.04 (\"Disco Dingo\") or higher. Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Joomla 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

      "body": "With the PHP agent, you can add browser monitoring to your pages either automatically or manually. To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the PHP agent. To use browser monitoring with your PHP agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Use auto-instrumentation To configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with the browser monitoring script, add or edit the auto-instrumentation flag in your INI file. The PHP agent will automatically inject the browser monitoring's JS snippet into your pages. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument=1 Copy Auto-instrumentation does not work when the HTTP header field Content-Length is set. To use browser monitoring in this situation, disable auto-instrumentation and manually insert the JavaScript header and footer into your templates. Manually instrument via agent API To manually configure browser monitoring, include the appropriate scripts in your pages. The New Relic PHP agent has an API to automatically generate the required JavaScript header and footer in place. Important Calls to the PHP agent API are conditional on the newrelic extension being loaded so that the PHP agent is running. If the agent is not running, calls to generate the JavaScript header and footer will result in errors, as the functions will not be defined. For more information, see: auto_instrument agent settings newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer() Manually instrument for various frameworks This document does not provide detailed procedures to manually insert the browser agent via the agent API. This is because there too many possible ways to construct a framework. The manual instrumentation examples show how to add instrumentation to frameworks that already support auto-instrumentation. If you are using another framework or modified versions of Drupal or WordPress, be sure to call the API functions for instrumentation at the right place. Insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() as part of the output page's <head> tag, preferably as the very first thing. As the very last thing before the closing </body> tag in the document, or as close to it as possible, insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(). Here are some basic examples. WordPress This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a WordPress installation using the default twentyten theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/header.php. <body <?php body_class(); ?>> <div id=\"wrapper\" class=\"hfeed\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"masthead\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the end user monitoring footer in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/footer.php. ... </div><!-- #site-generator --> </div><!-- #colophon --> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> </div><!-- #footer --> Copy Drupal This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a Drupal installation using the default garland theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header right after the opening header tag in website home dir/drupal/themes/garland/page.tpl.php. <div id=\"container\" class=\"clear-block\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"logo-floater\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the footer right before the last closing layout tag: ... </div> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> <!-- /layout --> <?php print $closure ?> </body> </html> Copy Important In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the JavaScript (newrelic.js) is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. View Browser data Once you enable browser monitoring and generate traffic for your app, data will appear in your app's browser Summary page. There is a short delay the first time you start the daemon (or when the PHP agent encounters a new application) while the daemon verifies the settings. After that, the New Relic JavaScript snippet is available. Disable auto-instrumentation For how to disable browser monitoring with the PHP agent config, see Browser monitoring config option. For how to use the API to disable browser monitoring, see newrelic_disable_autorum().

To enable browser monitoring in the user interface, follow the procedures to install the browser agent. Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the PHP agent. To use browser monitoring with your PHP agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the agent installation instructions. Use auto-instrumentation To configure the agent to automatically instrument pages with the browser monitoring script, add or edit the auto-instrumentation flag in your INI file. The PHP agent will automatically inject the browser monitoring's JS snippet into your pages. newrelic.browser_monitoring.auto_instrument=1 Copy Auto-instrumentation does not work when the HTTP header field Content-Length is set. To use browser monitoring in this situation, disable auto-instrumentation and manually insert the JavaScript header and footer into your templates. Manually instrument via agent API To manually configure browser monitoring, include the appropriate scripts in your pages. The New Relic PHP agent has an API to automatically generate the required JavaScript header and footer in place. Important Calls to the PHP agent API are conditional on the newrelic extension being loaded so that the PHP agent is running. If the agent is not running, calls to generate the JavaScript header and footer will result in errors, as the functions will not be defined. For more information, see: auto_instrument agent settings newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer() Manually instrument for various frameworks This document does not provide detailed procedures to manually insert the browser agent via the agent API. This is because there too many possible ways to construct a framework. The manual instrumentation examples show how to add instrumentation to frameworks that already support auto-instrumentation. If you are using another framework or modified versions of Drupal or WordPress, be sure to call the API functions for instrumentation at the right place. Insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_header() as part of the output page's <head> tag, preferably as the very first thing. As the very last thing before the closing </body> tag in the document, or as close to it as possible, insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(). Here are some basic examples. WordPress This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a WordPress installation using the default twentyten theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/header.php. <body <?php body_class(); ?>> <div id=\"wrapper\" class=\"hfeed\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"masthead\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the end user monitoring footer in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/footer.php. ... </div><!-- #site-generator --> </div><!-- #colophon --> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> </div><!-- #footer --> Copy Drupal This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a Drupal installation using the default garland theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header right after the opening header tag in website home dir/drupal/themes/garland/page.tpl.php. <div id=\"container\" class=\"clear-block\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"logo-floater\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the footer right before the last closing layout tag: ... </div> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> <!-- /layout --> <?php print $closure ?> </body> </html> Copy Important In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the JavaScript (newrelic.js) is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. View Browser data Once you enable browser monitoring and generate traffic for your app, data will appear in your app's browser Summary page. There is a short delay the first time you start the daemon (or when the PHP agent encounters a new application) while the daemon verifies the settings. After that, the New Relic JavaScript snippet is available. Disable auto-instrumentation For how to disable browser monitoring with the PHP agent config, see Browser monitoring config option. For how to use the API to disable browser monitoring, see newrelic_disable_autorum().

As the very last thing before the closing </body> tag in the document, or as close to it as possible, insert the return value of newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(). Here are some basic examples. WordPress This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a WordPress installation using the default twentyten theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/header.php. <body <?php body_class(); ?>> <div id=\"wrapper\" class=\"hfeed\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"masthead\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the end user monitoring footer in website home dir/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyten/footer.php. ... </div><!-- #site-generator --> </div><!-- #colophon --> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> </div><!-- #footer --> Copy Drupal This example shows how to call the PHP agent API to generate headers and footers for a Drupal installation using the default garland theme. Insert a call to generate the JavaScript header right after the opening header tag in website home dir/drupal/themes/garland/page.tpl.php. <div id=\"container\" class=\"clear-block\"> <div id=\"header\"> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_header(); } ?> <div id=\"logo-floater\"> ... Copy Insert a call to generate the footer right before the last closing layout tag: ... </div> <?php if( extension_loaded('newrelic') ) { echo newrelic_get_browser_timing_footer(); } ?> <!-- /layout --> <?php print $closure ?> </body> </html> Copy Important In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the JavaScript (newrelic.js) is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. View Browser data Once you enable browser monitoring and generate traffic for your app, data will appear in your app's browser Summary page. There is a short delay the first time you start the daemon (or when the PHP agent encounters a new application) while the daemon verifies the settings. After that, the New Relic JavaScript snippet is available. Disable auto-instrumentation For how to disable browser monitoring with the PHP agent config, see Browser monitoring config option. For how to use the API to disable browser monitoring, see newrelic_disable_autorum().

      "body": "Before you install New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 6 or higher Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. Debian 7.0 (\"wheezy\") or higher Ubuntu LTS 14.04 (\"Trusty Tahr\") or higher or Ubuntu non-LTS 19.04 (\"Disco Dingo\") or higher. Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Joomla 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

In versions 3.5 or higher, time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions module_invoke and module_invoke_all. In previous versions, time was calculated from functions from a file with the \".module\" extension where the file name and function prefix were a match. Hooks: Versions 3.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within each Drupal hook. Time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions module_invoke and module_invoke_all. Views: Versions 3.5 or higher.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent includes support for automatic transaction naming for the Community and Enterprise editions of Magento 1 and 2. This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.

      "body": "The PHP agent captures special metrics for Drupal websites. When these metrics are collected, a Drupal tab appears in the New Relic user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select a Drupal app). Configuration The collection of Drupal-specific metrics can be controlled by newrelic.framework.drupal.modules. It is enabled by default (in versions 3.0 or higher), and can be disabled with: newrelic.framework.drupal.modules = 0 Copy Though this setting uses the word \"modules,\" it controls the collection of all Drupal metrics: modules, views, and hooks. Metrics The PHP agent collects metrics for the following: Modules: Versions 2.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within each Drupal module. In versions 3.5 or higher, time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions module_invoke and module_invoke_all. In previous versions, time was calculated from functions from a file with the \".module\" extension where the file name and function prefix were a match. Hooks: Versions 3.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within each Drupal hook. Time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions module_invoke and module_invoke_all. Views: Versions 3.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within a view's view::execute method. Drupal and Browser instrumentation In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the browser monitoring JavaScript is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. For more information, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Cron tasks Drupal supports periodically executing tasks to perform routine maintenance or similar work on behalf of installed Drupal modules. These tasks can be run without any manual involvement beyond the initial configuration. Commonly, these are referred to as cron tasks. Starting in version 4.3, the New Relic PHP agent detects the execution of these tasks and automatically marks them as background transactions regardless of how they were started.

This is enabled by default in versions 5.3 or higher, and it can be disabled with: newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks = false Copy Although this setting uses the word .hooks, it controls all WordPress metrics sent to New Relic, including hooks, plugins, and themes. Metrics The PHP agent receives metrics for the following: Hooks: These metrics indicate time spent within each WordPress hook. Time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions apply_filters, apply_filters_ref_array, do_action, and do_action_ref_array. Plugins and themes: These metrics indicate time spent within each WordPress plugin and theme. Time is calculated from the dispatch functions for hooks. Integration with New Relic partners By integrating your WordPress application with APM, you can view performance directly from your WordPress app's Administration page. For example, W3 Total Cache is one of New Relic's Connect partners that specializes in WordPress apps. WordPress plugin for browser monitoring Signing up for a New Relic account and adding browser monitoring to your WordPress site is fast and easy with the browser monitoring plugin for WordPress. The plugin and our browser monitoring do not require the special access required to install our PHP agent. This makes them generally compatible with all WordPress hosting providers. In addition, the WordPress plugin is supported by the authors and the WordPress community.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent includes support for automatic transaction naming for the Community and Enterprise editions of Magento 1 and 2. This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.

      "body": "If you install New Relic for WordPress websites, the PHP agent receives additional metrics. A WordPress page appears in the New Relic user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select a WordPress app). Configuration You can control which WordPress-specific metrics your app sends to New Relic by using the PHP agent's ini setting newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks. This is enabled by default in versions 5.3 or higher, and it can be disabled with: newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks = false Copy Although this setting uses the word .hooks, it controls all WordPress metrics sent to New Relic, including hooks, plugins, and themes. Metrics The PHP agent receives metrics for the following: Hooks: These metrics indicate time spent within each WordPress hook. Time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions apply_filters, apply_filters_ref_array, do_action, and do_action_ref_array. Plugins and themes: These metrics indicate time spent within each WordPress plugin and theme. Time is calculated from the dispatch functions for hooks. Integration with New Relic partners By integrating your WordPress application with APM, you can view performance directly from your WordPress app's Administration page. For example, W3 Total Cache is one of New Relic's Connect partners that specializes in WordPress apps. WordPress plugin for browser monitoring Signing up for a New Relic account and adding browser monitoring to your WordPress site is fast and easy with the browser monitoring plugin for WordPress. The plugin and our browser monitoring do not require the special access required to install our PHP agent. This makes them generally compatible with all WordPress hosting providers. In addition, the WordPress plugin is supported by the authors and the WordPress community.

If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the browser monitoring JavaScript is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. For more information, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent includes support for automatic transaction naming for the Community and Enterprise editions of Magento 1 and 2. This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.

This is enabled by default in versions 5.3 or higher, and it can be disabled with: newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks = false Copy Although this setting uses the word .hooks, it controls all WordPress metrics sent to New Relic, including hooks, plugins, and themes. Metrics The PHP agent receives metrics for the following: Hooks: These metrics indicate time spent within each WordPress hook. Time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions apply_filters, apply_filters_ref_array, do_action, and do_action_ref_array. Plugins and themes: These metrics indicate time spent within each WordPress plugin and theme. Time is calculated from the dispatch functions for hooks. Integration with New Relic partners By integrating your WordPress application with APM, you can view performance directly from your WordPress app's Administration page. For example, W3 Total Cache is one of New Relic's Connect partners that specializes in WordPress apps. WordPress plugin for browser monitoring Signing up for a New Relic account and adding browser monitoring to your WordPress site is fast and easy with the browser monitoring plugin for WordPress. The plugin and our browser monitoring do not require the special access required to install our PHP agent. This makes them generally compatible with all WordPress hosting providers. In addition, the WordPress plugin is supported by the authors and the WordPress community.

When these metrics are collected, a Drupal tab appears in the New Relic user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select a Drupal app). Configuration The collection of Drupal-specific metrics can be controlled by newrelic.framework.drupal.modules. It is enabled by default (in versions 3.0 or higher), and can be disabled with: newrelic.framework.drupal.modules = 0 Copy Though this setting uses the word \"modules,\" it controls the collection of all Drupal metrics: modules, views, and hooks. Metrics The PHP agent collects metrics for the following: Modules: Versions 2.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within each Drupal module. In versions 3.5 or higher, time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions module_invoke and module_invoke_all. In previous versions, time was calculated from functions from a file with the \".module\" extension where the file name and function prefix were a match. Hooks: Versions 3.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within each Drupal hook. Time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions module_invoke and module_invoke_all. Views: Versions 3.5 or higher. These metrics indicate time spent within a view's view::execute method. Drupal and Browser instrumentation In Drupal 7.15, Compress cached pages is turned on by default. If you also select Cache pages for anonymous users, the browser monitoring JavaScript is not inserted into the served pages for anonymous users. This is because Drupal's pages are compressed directly from the database before they are stored in the cache (with gzip), so New Relic's PHP agent does not have a chance to parse any HTML. In this situation, manual instrumentation provides a better opportunity to capture data for anonymous users. For more information, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Cron tasks Drupal supports periodically executing tasks to perform routine maintenance or similar work on behalf of installed Drupal modules. These tasks can be run without any manual involvement beyond the initial configuration. Commonly, these are referred to as cron tasks. Starting in version 4.3, the New Relic PHP agent detects the execution of these tasks and automatically marks them as background transactions regardless of how they were started.

      "body": "New Relic's PHP agent includes support for automatic transaction naming for the Community and Enterprise editions of Magento 1 and 2. This document describes how this works and how you can use the automated names to track issues on your Magento application. Magento 1 Transactions in Magento 1 applications are named based on the module, controller, and action that handle the request. For example, a transaction for the default customer account page will be named customer/account/index, which indicates that the indexAction() method in Mage_Customer_AccountController (the account controller in the customer module) was responsible for the transaction. Magento 2 Normal web transactions in Magento 2 applications are named similarly to Magento 1 transactions: the transaction name encodes the module, controller, and action that handled the request. For example, a request handled by the Magento\\Customer\\Controller\\Account\\Index controller class will also be named customer/account/index. Web APIs Magento 2 also includes built-in support for web APIs. These are web services that are made available through REST and SOAP. As of PHP agent version 7.0, New Relic supports automatically naming transactions that use this functionality. Previous versions of the PHP agent named web API transactions as unknown by default. Magento 2 web APIs Comments SOAP SOAP transactions are named based on the service class and method that handled the request. For example, the transaction name Webapi/Soap/Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface/getTree indicates that a SOAP request was handled by the getTree() method on the model implementing Magento\\Catalog\\Api\\CategoryManagementInterface. WSDL transactions are also named automatically: Webapi/Soap/WsdlList is used for transactions that return the list of available APIs, whereas Webapi/Soap/Wsdl is used for transactions that get the WSDL for a specific SOAP API. REST From Magento 2.1 onwards, REST transactions are named similarly to SOAP transactions. The only difference is that REST requests are prefixed with Webapi/Rest instead of Webapi/Soap. On Magento 2.0, the PHP agent is unable to automatically name the specific service class and method that handled the transaction. Instead, REST requests currently receive the generic name FrontController/Magento\\Webapi\\Controller\\Rest\\Interceptor. This may be improved in a future PHP agent release. As a workaround, New Relic recommends using newrelic_name_transaction() in the service method if greater resolution is required. FrontControllerInterface plugins It is possible in Magento 2 to register a plugin or interceptor for the Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface interface to replace the default routing engine. For example, this is how the web API features operate. If an interceptor is registered for Magento\\Framework\\App\\FrontControllerInterface, the name of that class will be used as the default transaction name when using New Relic's PHP agent version 7.0 or higher. You can also use newrelic_name_transaction() for manual naming if needed. Escape automatic transaction naming If automatic transaction naming is not useful, you can override the PHP agent's automatic transaction naming by using the newrelic_name_transaction() API function.

Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP) For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP) For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "The PHP agent default security settings automatically provide security for your APM data to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You may have business reasons to change these settings. If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Default security settings By default, here is how the New Relic PHP agent handles the following potentially sensitive data: Request parameters: The agent does not capture HTTP request parameters. HTTPS: The agent communicates with New Relic using HTTPS. SQL: The agent sets SQL recording to obfuscated, which removes the potentially sensitive numeric and string literal values. High security mode settings When you enable high security mode, the default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition: You cannot create custom events. The agent strips exception messages from errors. Custom security settings Caution If you customize security settings, it may impact the security of your application. If you need different security settings than default or high security mode, you can customize these settings: PHP agent configuration file Attribute settings PHP agent API Setting Effects on data security newrelic.daemon.auditlog string Default: (none) If you use this to set the name of the audit log file, the agent will log details of messages passed back and forth between the monitored process and the New Relic collector. You can then evaluate the information that the agent sends to the New Relic collector to see if it includes sensitive information. newrelic.high_security boolean Default: false To enable high security mode, set this to true and enable high security in New Relic. This restricts the information you can send to New Relic. newrelic.daemon.proxy string Default: (none) Some proxies default to using HTTP, which is a less secure protocol. newrelic.attributes.enabled boolean Default: true By default, you are sending attributes to New Relic. If you do not want to send attributes to New Relic, set this to false. newrelic.attributes.exclude string Default: (none) If there are specific attribute keys that you do not want to send to New Relic in transaction traces, identify them using newrelic.attributes.exclude. This restricts the information sent to New Relic. Consider if you want to exclude these potentially sensitive attributes using newrelic.attributes.exclude or if you need the information sent to New Relic: request.headers.*: Removes all request headers. response.headers.*: Removes all response headers. newrelic.custom_insights_events.enabled boolean Default: true By default, the agent records events sent to the Event API via newrelic_record_custom_event(). If you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to false. newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql string Default: obfuscated By default, newrelic.transaction_tracer.record_sql is set to obfuscated, which strips out the numeric and string literals. If you do not want the agent to capture query information, set this to off. If you want the agent to capture all query information in its original form, set this to raw. When you enable high security mode, this is automatically set to obfuscated.

Use default transaction attributes or add your own Query your data using NRQL Send your own event data Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards Architecture The PHP agent has two binaries that work together to forward data to New Relic: The agent handles automatic and API instrumentation of your PHP code. The daemon acts as a proxy between the agent and the New Relic platform. You can connect up to 500 applications/agents to one daemon. The daemon imposes sampling when the harvest cycle limits are reached, so consider this when deciding how many applications/agents to connect to a single daemon. Tip The number of applications/agents per daemon may be lower when running in separate Docker containers, depending on the capacity of the connection between containers. The flow of data from your PHP applications to New Relic. The workflow between your application and New Relic must occur in this order: The agent establishes a socket connection with the daemon by sending the first payload of instrumentation data. The daemon establishes an HTTPS link with the New Relic platform. The daemon must be invoked before your instrumented application is invoked. This is called agent mode and is the default. To avoid losing reported data, make sure your instrumented application doesn't send transactions before both connections are established. Install the agent Before you install the PHP agent, ensure your system meets the system requirements. The PHP agent supports many of the most common PHP frameworks, databases, and libraries. You can also use the agent in a Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Tip If you are installing the agent on a shared hosting service, ensure you have root permissions to install the agent or contact your hosting provider for technical assistance. To install the agent, sign up for New Relic first. Once logged in, use our launcher, or see the instructions for specific installations. Add PHP data For standard installations, see: PHP agent installation overview (the basic installation steps for the most common setups). Installing on RedHat or CentOS Installing on Ubuntu or Debian Installing with tar archive (generic method to use on any supported systems such as Linux variants, OpenSolaris, SmartOS, FreeBSD, macOS, etc) The newrelic-install script (how to use the interactive script that automates some installation tasks) For other types of PHP installations and advanced installation topics, see: PHP agent installation: Non-standard PHP Starting the PHP daemon (a standard New Relic installation starts the daemon automatically, but you can also start the daemon manually) Silent mode for the install script Google App Engine (GAE) flex environment installation for New Relic's PHP agent Configure the agent The agent includes a variety of configuration options to further customize and fine-tune your installation. Tip The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. After changing any agent configuration options, restart your web server. Extend agent instrumentation After installing the agent, go further and extend the agent's instrumentation: Page load timing: Integrate the PHP agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. Custom instrumentation: Instrument transactions not captured as part of our framework instrumentation. Agent API: Use the agent API to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Agent attributes: Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Troubleshoot your installation If you encounter issues with the PHP agent, see our full list of troubleshooting documentation. Common installation issues include: No data appears (PHP) Determining permissions requirements INI settings not taking effect immediately Why and when to restart your web server (PHP) For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Requirements Agent version 2.6 or higher. Caution If you include an exception ($e), there are differences depending on the PHP version you are using: PHP version 5 or lower: You must pass a valid PHP Exception class. PHP version 7 or higher: You must pass a valid PHP Throwable interface. Description The PHP agent handles PHP errors and exceptions automatically for supported frameworks. If you want to collect errors that are not handled automatically so that you can query for those errors in New Relic and view error traces, you can use newrelic_notice_error. If you want to use your own error and exception handlers, you can set newrelic_notice_error as the callback. Collect errors that are not handled automatically To collect errors that the PHP agent does not handle automatically, such as non-PHP errors, add this call to the function that you want to report on: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Important When there are multiple calls to this function in a single transaction, the PHP agent retains the exception from the last call only. Set the callback for your own error and exception handler To use your own handler, use these calls to make sure that the PHP agent notices the errors and exceptions from within your handler. set_exception_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_exception_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy set_error_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_error_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameters This function can handle a variable number of parameters. You can pass-in 1 or 5 parameters, depending on your use case. newrelic_notice_error(string $message) Copy Parameter Description $message string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Parameter Description $e exception Required. Defaults to null. The agent uses Exception or Throwable to capture the stack frame and set the error class to the exception class name. If null or omitted, the agent reports an \"exception\" in the same format created by Exception::__toString. newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameter Description $errno integer Required. The predefined level of the error, expressed as an integer. $errstr string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. $errfile string Optional. The name of the file that the error occurred in. $errline integer Optional. The line number where the error occurred. $errcontext string Optional. An array that points to the symbol table that was active when the error occurred. Return values Returns null regardless of result. Examples Collect errors that are not handled automatically Track errors that aren't reported automatically or that aren't PHP errors. In this example, an error is sent to the PHP agent if an unknown user accesses your app. try { //Add your code that may throw an error here. } catch (UserNotFoundException $e) { newrelic_notice_error($e); //Handle normally. } Copy Report exceptions from your own exception handler Make the PHP agent notice exceptions from within your own exception handler. function example_exception_handler($ex) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error($ex); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.6 or higher) PHP version 5.6 or higher: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error(...func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.5 or lower) PHP version 5.5 or lower: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { call_user_func_array('newrelic_notice_error', func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Joomla 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

Debian 7.0 (\"wheezy\") or higher Ubuntu LTS 14.04 (\"Trusty Tahr\") or higher or Ubuntu non-LTS 19.04 (\"Disco Dingo\") or higher. Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Joomla 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

      "body": "Our PHP agent auto-instruments your code so you can start monitoring applications. You can use our launcher, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic PHP agent installation. Add PHP data PHP components Our PHP agent consists of two basic components: A PHP extension, which collects data from your application A local proxy daemon, which transmits the data to New Relic Your system's configuration components, including the web server, operating system, system permissions, PHP installation itself, package manager, etc., are all important factors during installation and configuration, because the agent is a part of that. For more information about supported PHP releases, frameworks, and other system requirements, see PHP compatibility and requirements. Install the agent Follow this general process to install the agent on your system. The agent installation package or tar archive includes the interactive newrelic-install script, which automates some installation tasks. Tip If your application is frequently inactive, we recommend you generate some data by interacting with the application or site. This will help ensure the agent initially connects. If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Ensure your system meets the agent's requirements, including appropriate system permissions. From your Account settings, copy your license key information. Install the agent package or tar archive on your system. RedHat or CentOS The most common way to install the agent on RedHat or CentOS is with the installation package (.rpm) and the package manager. You can tell the package manager to get it from the New Relic repository, or you can download the .rpm file directly from the New Relic website. Install the package with your preferred package manager (yum or rpm) and then run the newrelic-install script. Ubuntu or Debian Install the package either with apt-get or with dpkg commands. Typically, running the newrelic-install script is not required. Tar archive The .tar archive method is the most generic method you can use on all supported operating systems. Download the compressed tar archive for your system if any of these situations apply to you: Your operating system is not listed here. You are not using a package manager. Other methods are unsuccessful. Install the tar archive of the agent on any supported platform. Change the default application name to a meaningful name. Optional: Change other agent configuration settings to further customize your installation. Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.). Recommendation: To help ensure the PHP agent is initiated, especially if your application has infrequent activity, generate some data by using the app for a few seconds. Wait a few minutes for your application to send data to New Relic. Then, check your app's performance in the New Relic UI. Install PHP with partnership accounts Installation procedures may be different for admins who install the PHP agent through a New Relic partnership. For more information, see: AWS Heroku Magento Shared hosting providers Other partnership installation procedures Not all partners support PHP agents.

For Ubuntu or Debian it is more common to use the Debian package. Download the tar distribution Unlike other installation options, tar archives do not require any special repository setup. All you need to do is download the archive and follow these instructions. Download the appropriate tar distribution file from download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/. For example: For FreeBSD, download newrelic-php5-X.X.X.X-freebsd.tar.gz. For Alpine Linux, download newrelic-php5-X.X.X.X-linux-musl.tar.gz. Tip The package name for the New Relic's PHP agent is newrelic-php5. Although the name references PHP 5, this package works for all supported PHP versions, including PHP 7 versions. Install or update With tar file installation, the steps for first time installation and for updating are the same. Replace X.X.X.X with the correct New Relic version. To install or update the agent: Download the appropriate tar file from the New Relic website, and save it to a local disk in a convenient location. Decompress and extract the archive: gzip -dc newrelic-php5-X.X.X.X-OS.tar.gz | tar xf - Copy Change to the newly created directory: cd newrelic-php5-X.X.X.X-OS Copy Run the installation script: ./newrelic-install Copy Change the default application name to a meaningful name.

Typically, running the newrelic-install script is not required. Tar archive The .tar archive method is the most generic method you can use on all supported operating systems. Download the compressed tar archive for your system if any of these situations apply to you: Your operating system is not listed here. You are not using a package manager. Other methods are unsuccessful. Install the tar archive of the agent on any supported platform. Change the default application name to a meaningful name. Optional: Change other agent configuration settings to further customize your installation. Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.). Recommendation: To help ensure the PHP agent is initiated, especially if your application has infrequent activity, generate some data by using the app for a few seconds. Wait a few minutes for your application to send data to New Relic. Then, check your app's performance in the New Relic UI. Install PHP with partnership accounts Installation procedures may be different for admins who install the PHP agent through a New Relic partnership. For more information, see: AWS Heroku Magento Shared hosting providers Other partnership installation procedures Not all partners support PHP agents.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 6 or higher Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. Debian 7.0 (\"wheezy\") or higher Ubuntu LTS 14.04 (\"Trusty Tahr\") or higher or Ubuntu non-LTS 19.04 (\"Disco Dingo\") or higher. Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Joomla 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

You can use our launcher, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic PHP agent installation. Add PHP data PHP components Our PHP agent consists of two basic components: A PHP extension, which collects data from your application A local proxy daemon, which transmits the data to New Relic Your system's configuration components, including the web server, operating system, system permissions, PHP installation itself, package manager, etc., are all important factors during installation and configuration, because the agent is a part of that. For more information about supported PHP releases, frameworks, and other system requirements, see PHP compatibility and requirements. Install the agent Follow this general process to install the agent on your system. The agent installation package or tar archive includes the interactive newrelic-install script, which automates some installation tasks. Tip If your application is frequently inactive, we recommend you generate some data by interacting with the application or site. This will help ensure the agent initially connects. If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Ensure your system meets the agent's requirements, including appropriate system permissions. From your Account settings, copy your license key information. Install the agent package or tar archive on your system. RedHat or CentOS The most common way to install the agent on RedHat or CentOS is with the installation package (.rpm) and the package manager. You can tell the package manager to get it from the New Relic repository, or you can download the .rpm file directly from the New Relic website. Install the package with your preferred package manager (yum or rpm) and then run the newrelic-install script. Ubuntu or Debian Install the package either with apt-get or with dpkg commands. Typically, running the newrelic-install script is not required. Tar archive The .tar archive method is the most generic method you can use on all supported operating systems. Download the compressed tar archive for your system if any of these situations apply to you: Your operating system is not listed here. You are not using a package manager. Other methods are unsuccessful. Install the tar archive of the agent on any supported platform. Change the default application name to a meaningful name. Optional: Change other agent configuration settings to further customize your installation. Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.). Recommendation: To help ensure the PHP agent is initiated, especially if your application has infrequent activity, generate some data by using the app for a few seconds. Wait a few minutes for your application to send data to New Relic. Then, check your app's performance in the New Relic UI. Install PHP with partnership accounts Installation procedures may be different for admins who install the PHP agent through a New Relic partnership.

Your hosting provider may allow or provide installation for common web apps/frameworks (such as WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, etc), but installing the PHP agent still requires permissions not allowed in many basic plans. If necessary, contact your website developer/hosting provider for technical assistance. Shared hosting services In general, shared hosting providers (who do not provide root command line access) and hosting providers that do not have traditional operating systems (such as PaaS) do not allow users to install New Relic agents through typical channels. For example, these hosting providers do not support New Relic integrations for certain subscription levels: DreamHost: Shared Web Hosting WordPress.com hosted blog GoDaddy: Economy, Deluxe, Ultimate, WordPress Blog Hosting HostGator Web Hosting Before you install New Relic's PHP agent, make sure your hosting service level is compatible with New Relic. Also make sure you have administrator permissions for installation procedures from the command line at the root level. Installation and troubleshooting tips To help ensure that your application can integrate successfully with New Relic: Make sure your system meets New Relic's PHP compatibility requirements. Important Windows operating systems are not supported. Follow New Relic's PHP installation procedures. If your system meets New Relic's compatibility requirements but your installation is unsuccessful, gather the following information: Exact steps you tried Results, including success or failure messages Your operating system and version (for example, Ubuntu Linux version 12.04 64-bit) Your hosting service provider and subscription level If applicable, contact your website developer for assistance.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 6 or higher Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. Debian 7.0 (\"wheezy\") or higher Ubuntu LTS 14.04 (\"Trusty Tahr\") or higher or Ubuntu non-LTS 19.04 (\"Disco Dingo\") or higher. Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Joomla 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

You can use our launcher, or follow the instructions in this document to complete a basic PHP agent installation. Add PHP data PHP components Our PHP agent consists of two basic components: A PHP extension, which collects data from your application A local proxy daemon, which transmits the data to New Relic Your system's configuration components, including the web server, operating system, system permissions, PHP installation itself, package manager, etc., are all important factors during installation and configuration, because the agent is a part of that. For more information about supported PHP releases, frameworks, and other system requirements, see PHP compatibility and requirements. Install the agent Follow this general process to install the agent on your system. The agent installation package or tar archive includes the interactive newrelic-install script, which automates some installation tasks. Tip If your application is frequently inactive, we recommend you generate some data by interacting with the application or site. This will help ensure the agent initially connects. If you haven't already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Ensure your system meets the agent's requirements, including appropriate system permissions. From your Account settings, copy your license key information. Install the agent package or tar archive on your system. RedHat or CentOS The most common way to install the agent on RedHat or CentOS is with the installation package (.rpm) and the package manager. You can tell the package manager to get it from the New Relic repository, or you can download the .rpm file directly from the New Relic website. Install the package with your preferred package manager (yum or rpm) and then run the newrelic-install script. Ubuntu or Debian Install the package either with apt-get or with dpkg commands. Typically, running the newrelic-install script is not required. Tar archive The .tar archive method is the most generic method you can use on all supported operating systems. Download the compressed tar archive for your system if any of these situations apply to you: Your operating system is not listed here. You are not using a package manager. Other methods are unsuccessful. Install the tar archive of the agent on any supported platform. Change the default application name to a meaningful name.

Requirements Agent version 2.6 or higher. Caution If you include an exception ($e), there are differences depending on the PHP version you are using: PHP version 5 or lower: You must pass a valid PHP Exception class. PHP version 7 or higher: You must pass a valid PHP Throwable interface. Description The PHP agent handles PHP errors and exceptions automatically for supported frameworks. If you want to collect errors that are not handled automatically so that you can query for those errors in New Relic and view error traces, you can use newrelic_notice_error. If you want to use your own error and exception handlers, you can set newrelic_notice_error as the callback. Collect errors that are not handled automatically To collect errors that the PHP agent does not handle automatically, such as non-PHP errors, add this call to the function that you want to report on: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Important When there are multiple calls to this function in a single transaction, the PHP agent retains the exception from the last call only. Set the callback for your own error and exception handler To use your own handler, use these calls to make sure that the PHP agent notices the errors and exceptions from within your handler. set_exception_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_exception_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy set_error_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_error_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameters This function can handle a variable number of parameters. You can pass-in 1 or 5 parameters, depending on your use case. newrelic_notice_error(string $message) Copy Parameter Description $message string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Parameter Description $e exception Required. Defaults to null. The agent uses Exception or Throwable to capture the stack frame and set the error class to the exception class name. If null or omitted, the agent reports an \"exception\" in the same format created by Exception::__toString. newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameter Description $errno integer Required. The predefined level of the error, expressed as an integer. $errstr string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. $errfile string Optional. The name of the file that the error occurred in. $errline integer Optional. The line number where the error occurred. $errcontext string Optional. An array that points to the symbol table that was active when the error occurred. Return values Returns null regardless of result. Examples Collect errors that are not handled automatically Track errors that aren't reported automatically or that aren't PHP errors. In this example, an error is sent to the PHP agent if an unknown user accesses your app. try { //Add your code that may throw an error here. } catch (UserNotFoundException $e) { newrelic_notice_error($e); //Handle normally. } Copy Report exceptions from your own exception handler Make the PHP agent notice exceptions from within your own exception handler. function example_exception_handler($ex) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error($ex); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.6 or higher) PHP version 5.6 or higher: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error(...func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.5 or lower) PHP version 5.5 or lower: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { call_user_func_array('newrelic_notice_error', func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Caution If you include an exception ($e), there are differences depending on the PHP version you are using: PHP version 5 or lower: You must pass a valid PHP Exception class. PHP version 7 or higher: You must pass a valid PHP Throwable interface. Description The PHP agent handles PHP errors and exceptions automatically for supported frameworks. If you want to collect errors that are not handled automatically so that you can query for those errors in New Relic and view error traces, you can use newrelic_notice_error. If you want to use your own error and exception handlers, you can set newrelic_notice_error as the callback. Collect errors that are not handled automatically To collect errors that the PHP agent does not handle automatically, such as non-PHP errors, add this call to the function that you want to report on: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Important When there are multiple calls to this function in a single transaction, the PHP agent retains the exception from the last call only. Set the callback for your own error and exception handler To use your own handler, use these calls to make sure that the PHP agent notices the errors and exceptions from within your handler. set_exception_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_exception_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy set_error_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_error_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameters This function can handle a variable number of parameters. You can pass-in 1 or 5 parameters, depending on your use case. newrelic_notice_error(string $message) Copy Parameter Description $message string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Parameter Description $e exception Required. Defaults to null. The agent uses Exception or Throwable to capture the stack frame and set the error class to the exception class name. If null or omitted, the agent reports an \"exception\" in the same format created by Exception::__toString. newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameter Description $errno integer Required. The predefined level of the error, expressed as an integer. $errstr string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. $errfile string Optional. The name of the file that the error occurred in. $errline integer Optional. The line number where the error occurred. $errcontext string Optional. An array that points to the symbol table that was active when the error occurred. Return values Returns null regardless of result. Examples Collect errors that are not handled automatically Track errors that aren't reported automatically or that aren't PHP errors. In this example, an error is sent to the PHP agent if an unknown user accesses your app. try { //Add your code that may throw an error here. } catch (UserNotFoundException $e) { newrelic_notice_error($e); //Handle normally. } Copy Report exceptions from your own exception handler Make the PHP agent notice exceptions from within your own exception handler. function example_exception_handler($ex) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error($ex); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.6 or higher) PHP version 5.6 or higher: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error(...func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.5 or lower) PHP version 5.5 or lower: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { call_user_func_array('newrelic_notice_error', func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Caution If you include an exception ($e), there are differences depending on the PHP version you are using: PHP version 5 or lower: You must pass a valid PHP Exception class. PHP version 7 or higher: You must pass a valid PHP Throwable interface. Description The PHP agent handles PHP errors and exceptions automatically for supported frameworks. If you want to collect errors that are not handled automatically so that you can query for those errors in New Relic and view error traces, you can use newrelic_notice_error. If you want to use your own error and exception handlers, you can set newrelic_notice_error as the callback.

Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Parameter Description $e exception Required. Defaults to null. The agent uses Exception or Throwable to capture the stack frame and set the error class to the exception class name. If null or omitted, the agent reports an \"exception\" in the same format created by Exception::__toString. newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameter Description $errno integer Required.

Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds.

Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds.

Caution If you include an exception ($e), there are differences depending on the PHP version you are using: PHP version 5 or lower: You must pass a valid PHP Exception class.

If you want to collect errors that are not handled automatically so that you can query for those errors in New Relic and view error traces, you can use newrelic_notice_error. If you want to use your own error and exception handlers, you can set newrelic_notice_error as the callback.

You can pass-in 1 or 5 parameters, depending on your use case. newrelic_notice_error(string $message) Copy Parameter Description $message string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Parameter Description $e exception Required. Defaults to null. The agent uses Exception or Throwable to capture the stack frame and set the error class to the exception class name. If null or omitted, the agent reports an \"exception\" in the same format created by Exception::__toString. newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameter Description $errno integer Required. The predefined level of the error, expressed as an integer. $errstr string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. $errfile string Optional. The name of the file that the error occurred in. $errline integer Optional. The line number where the error occurred. $errcontext string Optional. An array that points to the symbol table that was active when the error occurred. Return values Returns null regardless of result. Examples Collect errors that are not handled automatically Track errors that aren't reported automatically or that aren't PHP errors.

Set the callback for your own error and exception handler To use your own handler, use these calls to make sure that the PHP agent notices the errors and exceptions from within your handler. set_exception_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_exception_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy set_error_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_error_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameters This function can handle a variable number of parameters. You can pass-in 1 or 5 parameters, depending on your use case. newrelic_notice_error(string $message) Copy Parameter Description $message string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Parameter Description $e exception Required. Defaults to null. The agent uses Exception or Throwable to capture the stack frame and set the error class to the exception class name. If null or omitted, the agent reports an \"exception\" in the same format created by Exception::__toString. newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameter Description $errno integer Required. The predefined level of the error, expressed as an integer. $errstr string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. $errfile string Optional. The name of the file that the error occurred in. $errline integer Optional. The line number where the error occurred. $errcontext string Optional. An array that points to the symbol table that was active when the error occurred. Return values Returns null regardless of result. Examples Collect errors that are not handled automatically Track errors that aren't reported automatically or that aren't PHP errors. In this example, an error is sent to the PHP agent if an unknown user accesses your app. try { //Add your code that may throw an error here. } catch (UserNotFoundException $e) { newrelic_notice_error($e); //Handle normally. } Copy Report exceptions from your own exception handler Make the PHP agent notice exceptions from within your own exception handler. function example_exception_handler($ex) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error($ex); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.6 or higher) PHP version 5.6 or higher: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error(...func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.5 or lower) PHP version 5.5 or lower: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { call_user_func_array('newrelic_notice_error', func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Requirements Agent version 2.6 or higher. Caution If you include an exception ($e), there are differences depending on the PHP version you are using: PHP version 5 or lower: You must pass a valid PHP Exception class. PHP version 7 or higher: You must pass a valid PHP Throwable interface. Description The PHP agent handles PHP errors and exceptions automatically for supported frameworks. If you want to collect errors that are not handled automatically so that you can query for those errors in New Relic and view error traces, you can use newrelic_notice_error. If you want to use your own error and exception handlers, you can set newrelic_notice_error as the callback. Collect errors that are not handled automatically To collect errors that the PHP agent does not handle automatically, such as non-PHP errors, add this call to the function that you want to report on: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Important When there are multiple calls to this function in a single transaction, the PHP agent retains the exception from the last call only. Set the callback for your own error and exception handler To use your own handler, use these calls to make sure that the PHP agent notices the errors and exceptions from within your handler. set_exception_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_exception_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy set_error_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_error_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameters This function can handle a variable number of parameters. You can pass-in 1 or 5 parameters, depending on your use case. newrelic_notice_error(string $message) Copy Parameter Description $message string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Parameter Description $e exception Required. Defaults to null. The agent uses Exception or Throwable to capture the stack frame and set the error class to the exception class name. If null or omitted, the agent reports an \"exception\" in the same format created by Exception::__toString. newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameter Description $errno integer Required. The predefined level of the error, expressed as an integer. $errstr string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. $errfile string Optional. The name of the file that the error occurred in. $errline integer Optional. The line number where the error occurred. $errcontext string Optional. An array that points to the symbol table that was active when the error occurred. Return values Returns null regardless of result. Examples Collect errors that are not handled automatically Track errors that aren't reported automatically or that aren't PHP errors. In this example, an error is sent to the PHP agent if an unknown user accesses your app. try { //Add your code that may throw an error here. } catch (UserNotFoundException $e) { newrelic_notice_error($e); //Handle normally. } Copy Report exceptions from your own exception handler Make the PHP agent notice exceptions from within your own exception handler. function example_exception_handler($ex) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error($ex); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.6 or higher) PHP version 5.6 or higher: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error(...func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.5 or lower) PHP version 5.5 or lower: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { call_user_func_array('newrelic_notice_error', func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Caution If you include an exception ($e), there are differences depending on the PHP version you are using: PHP version 5 or lower: You must pass a valid PHP Exception class. PHP version 7 or higher: You must pass a valid PHP Throwable interface. Description The PHP agent handles PHP errors and exceptions automatically for supported frameworks. If you want to collect errors that are not handled automatically so that you can query for those errors in New Relic and view error traces, you can use newrelic_notice_error. If you want to use your own error and exception handlers, you can set newrelic_notice_error as the callback.

Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Parameter Description $e exception Required. Defaults to null. The agent uses Exception or Throwable to capture the stack frame and set the error class to the exception class name. If null or omitted, the agent reports an \"exception\" in the same format created by Exception::__toString. newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameter Description $errno integer Required.

Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. New Relic may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the metric was added successfully.

Caution If you include an exception ($e), there are differences depending on the PHP version you are using: PHP version 5 or lower: You must pass a valid PHP Exception class. PHP version 7 or higher: You must pass a valid PHP Throwable interface. Description The PHP agent handles PHP errors and exceptions automatically for supported frameworks. If you want to collect errors that are not handled automatically so that you can query for those errors in New Relic and view error traces, you can use newrelic_notice_error. If you want to use your own error and exception handlers, you can set newrelic_notice_error as the callback.

You can pass-in 1 or 5 parameters, depending on your use case. newrelic_notice_error(string $message) Copy Parameter Description $message string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Parameter Description $e exception Required. Defaults to null. The agent uses Exception or Throwable to capture the stack frame and set the error class to the exception class name. If null or omitted, the agent reports an \"exception\" in the same format created by Exception::__toString. newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameter Description $errno integer Required. The predefined level of the error, expressed as an integer. $errstr string Required.

Return values Returns null regardless of result. Examples Collect errors that are not handled automatically Track errors that aren't reported automatically or that aren't PHP errors.

Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required.

Caution If you include an exception ($e), there are differences depending on the PHP version you are using: PHP version 5 or lower: You must pass a valid PHP Exception class. PHP version 7 or higher: You must pass a valid PHP Throwable interface. Description The PHP agent handles PHP errors and exceptions automatically for supported frameworks. If you want to collect errors that are not handled automatically so that you can query for those errors in New Relic and view error traces, you can use newrelic_notice_error. If you want to use your own error and exception handlers, you can set newrelic_notice_error as the callback. Collect errors that are not handled automatically To collect errors that the PHP agent does not handle automatically, such as non-PHP errors, add this call to the function that you want to report on: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Important When there are multiple calls to this function in a single transaction, the PHP agent retains the exception from the last call only.

You can pass-in 1 or 5 parameters, depending on your use case. newrelic_notice_error(string $message) Copy Parameter Description $message string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Parameter Description $e exception Required. Defaults to null. The agent uses Exception or Throwable to capture the stack frame and set the error class to the exception class name. If null or omitted, the agent reports an \"exception\" in the same format created by Exception::__toString. newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameter Description $errno integer Required. The predefined level of the error, expressed as an integer. $errstr string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. $errfile string Optional. The name of the file that the error occurred in. $errline integer Optional. The line number where the error occurred. $errcontext string Optional. An array that points to the symbol table that was active when the error occurred. Return values Returns null regardless of result. Examples Collect errors that are not handled automatically Track errors that aren't reported automatically or that aren't PHP errors.

If you want to use your own error and exception handlers, you can set newrelic_notice_error as the callback. Collect errors that are not handled automatically To collect errors that the PHP agent does not handle automatically, such as non-PHP errors, add this call to the function that you want to report on: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Important When there are multiple calls to this function in a single transaction, the PHP agent retains the exception from the last call only. Set the callback for your own error and exception handler To use your own handler, use these calls to make sure that the PHP agent notices the errors and exceptions from within your handler. set_exception_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_exception_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy set_error_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_error_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameters This function can handle a variable number of parameters. You can pass-in 1 or 5 parameters, depending on your use case. newrelic_notice_error(string $message) Copy Parameter Description $message string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Parameter Description $e exception Required. Defaults to null. The agent uses Exception or Throwable to capture the stack frame and set the error class to the exception class name. If null or omitted, the agent reports an \"exception\" in the same format created by Exception::__toString. newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameter Description $errno integer Required. The predefined level of the error, expressed as an integer. $errstr string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. $errfile string Optional. The name of the file that the error occurred in. $errline integer Optional. The line number where the error occurred. $errcontext string Optional. An array that points to the symbol table that was active when the error occurred. Return values Returns null regardless of result. Examples Collect errors that are not handled automatically Track errors that aren't reported automatically or that aren't PHP errors. In this example, an error is sent to the PHP agent if an unknown user accesses your app. try { //Add your code that may throw an error here. } catch (UserNotFoundException $e) { newrelic_notice_error($e); //Handle normally. } Copy Report exceptions from your own exception handler Make the PHP agent notice exceptions from within your own exception handler. function example_exception_handler($ex) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error($ex); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.6 or higher) PHP version 5.6 or higher: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error(...func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.5 or lower) PHP version 5.5 or lower: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { call_user_func_array('newrelic_notice_error', func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Requirements Agent version 2.6 or higher. Caution If you include an exception ($e), there are differences depending on the PHP version you are using: PHP version 5 or lower: You must pass a valid PHP Exception class. PHP version 7 or higher: You must pass a valid PHP Throwable interface. Description The PHP agent handles PHP errors and exceptions automatically for supported frameworks. If you want to collect errors that are not handled automatically so that you can query for those errors in New Relic and view error traces, you can use newrelic_notice_error. If you want to use your own error and exception handlers, you can set newrelic_notice_error as the callback. Collect errors that are not handled automatically To collect errors that the PHP agent does not handle automatically, such as non-PHP errors, add this call to the function that you want to report on: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Important When there are multiple calls to this function in a single transaction, the PHP agent retains the exception from the last call only. Set the callback for your own error and exception handler To use your own handler, use these calls to make sure that the PHP agent notices the errors and exceptions from within your handler. set_exception_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_exception_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy set_error_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_error_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameters This function can handle a variable number of parameters. You can pass-in 1 or 5 parameters, depending on your use case. newrelic_notice_error(string $message) Copy Parameter Description $message string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Parameter Description $e exception Required. Defaults to null. The agent uses Exception or Throwable to capture the stack frame and set the error class to the exception class name. If null or omitted, the agent reports an \"exception\" in the same format created by Exception::__toString. newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameter Description $errno integer Required. The predefined level of the error, expressed as an integer. $errstr string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. $errfile string Optional. The name of the file that the error occurred in. $errline integer Optional. The line number where the error occurred. $errcontext string Optional. An array that points to the symbol table that was active when the error occurred. Return values Returns null regardless of result. Examples Collect errors that are not handled automatically Track errors that aren't reported automatically or that aren't PHP errors. In this example, an error is sent to the PHP agent if an unknown user accesses your app. try { //Add your code that may throw an error here. } catch (UserNotFoundException $e) { newrelic_notice_error($e); //Handle normally. } Copy Report exceptions from your own exception handler Make the PHP agent notice exceptions from within your own exception handler. function example_exception_handler($ex) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error($ex); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.6 or higher) PHP version 5.6 or higher: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error(...func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.5 or lower) PHP version 5.5 or lower: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { call_user_func_array('newrelic_notice_error', func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required.

This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds.

Caution If you include an exception ($e), there are differences depending on the PHP version you are using: PHP version 5 or lower: You must pass a valid PHP Exception class. PHP version 7 or higher: You must pass a valid PHP Throwable interface. Description The PHP agent handles PHP errors and exceptions automatically for supported frameworks. If you want to collect errors that are not handled automatically so that you can query for those errors in New Relic and view error traces, you can use newrelic_notice_error. If you want to use your own error and exception handlers, you can set newrelic_notice_error as the callback.

You can pass-in 1 or 5 parameters, depending on your use case. newrelic_notice_error(string $message) Copy Parameter Description $message string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Parameter Description $e exception Required. Defaults to null. The agent uses Exception or Throwable to capture the stack frame and set the error class to the exception class name. If null or omitted, the agent reports an \"exception\" in the same format created by Exception::__toString. newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameter Description $errno integer Required. The predefined level of the error, expressed as an integer. $errstr string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. $errfile string Optional. The name of the file that the error occurred in. $errline integer Optional. The line number where the error occurred. $errcontext string Optional. An array that points to the symbol table that was active when the error occurred. Return values Returns null regardless of result. Examples Collect errors that are not handled automatically Track errors that aren't reported automatically or that aren't PHP errors.

Collect errors that are not handled automatically To collect errors that the PHP agent does not handle automatically, such as non-PHP errors, add this call to the function that you want to report on: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Important When there are multiple calls to this function in a single transaction, the PHP agent retains the exception from the last call only. Set the callback for your own error and exception handler To use your own handler, use these calls to make sure that the PHP agent notices the errors and exceptions from within your handler. set_exception_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_exception_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy set_error_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_error_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameters This function can handle a variable number of parameters. You can pass-in 1 or 5 parameters, depending on your use case. newrelic_notice_error(string $message) Copy Parameter Description $message string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Parameter Description $e exception Required. Defaults to null. The agent uses Exception or Throwable to capture the stack frame and set the error class to the exception class name. If null or omitted, the agent reports an \"exception\" in the same format created by Exception::__toString. newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameter Description $errno integer Required. The predefined level of the error, expressed as an integer. $errstr string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. $errfile string Optional. The name of the file that the error occurred in. $errline integer Optional. The line number where the error occurred. $errcontext string Optional. An array that points to the symbol table that was active when the error occurred. Return values Returns null regardless of result. Examples Collect errors that are not handled automatically Track errors that aren't reported automatically or that aren't PHP errors. In this example, an error is sent to the PHP agent if an unknown user accesses your app. try { //Add your code that may throw an error here. } catch (UserNotFoundException $e) { newrelic_notice_error($e); //Handle normally. } Copy Report exceptions from your own exception handler Make the PHP agent notice exceptions from within your own exception handler. function example_exception_handler($ex) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error($ex); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.6 or higher) PHP version 5.6 or higher: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error(...func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.5 or lower) PHP version 5.5 or lower: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { call_user_func_array('newrelic_notice_error', func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Requirements Compatible with all agent versions. Description Record custom metrics that aren't captured by default by the PHP agent. Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. New Relic may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the metric was added successfully.

Requirements Agent version 2.6 or higher. Caution If you include an exception ($e), there are differences depending on the PHP version you are using: PHP version 5 or lower: You must pass a valid PHP Exception class. PHP version 7 or higher: You must pass a valid PHP Throwable interface. Description The PHP agent handles PHP errors and exceptions automatically for supported frameworks. If you want to collect errors that are not handled automatically so that you can query for those errors in New Relic and view error traces, you can use newrelic_notice_error. If you want to use your own error and exception handlers, you can set newrelic_notice_error as the callback. Collect errors that are not handled automatically To collect errors that the PHP agent does not handle automatically, such as non-PHP errors, add this call to the function that you want to report on: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Important When there are multiple calls to this function in a single transaction, the PHP agent retains the exception from the last call only. Set the callback for your own error and exception handler To use your own handler, use these calls to make sure that the PHP agent notices the errors and exceptions from within your handler. set_exception_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_exception_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy set_error_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_error_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameters This function can handle a variable number of parameters. You can pass-in 1 or 5 parameters, depending on your use case. newrelic_notice_error(string $message) Copy Parameter Description $message string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Parameter Description $e exception Required. Defaults to null. The agent uses Exception or Throwable to capture the stack frame and set the error class to the exception class name. If null or omitted, the agent reports an \"exception\" in the same format created by Exception::__toString. newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameter Description $errno integer Required. The predefined level of the error, expressed as an integer. $errstr string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. $errfile string Optional. The name of the file that the error occurred in. $errline integer Optional. The line number where the error occurred. $errcontext string Optional. An array that points to the symbol table that was active when the error occurred. Return values Returns null regardless of result. Examples Collect errors that are not handled automatically Track errors that aren't reported automatically or that aren't PHP errors. In this example, an error is sent to the PHP agent if an unknown user accesses your app. try { //Add your code that may throw an error here. } catch (UserNotFoundException $e) { newrelic_notice_error($e); //Handle normally. } Copy Report exceptions from your own exception handler Make the PHP agent notice exceptions from within your own exception handler. function example_exception_handler($ex) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error($ex); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.6 or higher) PHP version 5.6 or higher: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error(...func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.5 or lower) PHP version 5.5 or lower: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { call_user_func_array('newrelic_notice_error', func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Caution If you include an exception ($e), there are differences depending on the PHP version you are using: PHP version 5 or lower: You must pass a valid PHP Exception class. PHP version 7 or higher: You must pass a valid PHP Throwable interface. Description The PHP agent handles PHP errors and exceptions automatically for supported frameworks. If you want to collect errors that are not handled automatically so that you can query for those errors in New Relic and view error traces, you can use newrelic_notice_error. If you want to use your own error and exception handlers, you can set newrelic_notice_error as the callback.

Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Parameter Description $e exception Required. Defaults to null. The agent uses Exception or Throwable to capture the stack frame and set the error class to the exception class name. If null or omitted, the agent reports an \"exception\" in the same format created by Exception::__toString. newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameter Description $errno integer Required.

Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. New Relic may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the metric was added successfully.

Then you can: Use the data explorer to search for your custom metrics, create customizable charts, and add them to dashboards. Use the New Relic REST API to programmatically retrieve and use custom metric data outside of the New Relic UI. Create custom metric alerts to notify you or your team when your custom metric exceeds specific values. Parameters Parameter Description $metric_name string Required. Name your custom metrics with a Custom/ prefix (for example, Custom/MyMetric). This helps the UI organize your custom metrics in one place, and it makes them easily findable via the Metric Explorer. $value float Required. Records timing in milliseconds. For example: a value of 4 is stored as .004 seconds in New Relic's systems. If the value is NaN, Infinity, denorm or negative zero, the behavior of this function is undefined. New Relic may discard 1 or more bits of precision (ULPs) from the given value. Return values Returns true if the metric was added successfully.

Caution If you include an exception ($e), there are differences depending on the PHP version you are using: PHP version 5 or lower: You must pass a valid PHP Exception class. PHP version 7 or higher: You must pass a valid PHP Throwable interface. Description The PHP agent handles PHP errors and exceptions automatically for supported frameworks. If you want to collect errors that are not handled automatically so that you can query for those errors in New Relic and view error traces, you can use newrelic_notice_error. If you want to use your own error and exception handlers, you can set newrelic_notice_error as the callback.

Set the callback for your own error and exception handler To use your own handler, use these calls to make sure that the PHP agent notices the errors and exceptions from within your handler. set_exception_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_exception_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy set_error_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_error_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameters This function can handle a variable number of parameters. You can pass-in 1 or 5 parameters, depending on your use case. newrelic_notice_error(string $message) Copy Parameter Description $message string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Parameter Description $e exception Required. Defaults to null. The agent uses Exception or Throwable to capture the stack frame and set the error class to the exception class name. If null or omitted, the agent reports an \"exception\" in the same format created by Exception::__toString. newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameter Description $errno integer Required. The predefined level of the error, expressed as an integer. $errstr string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. $errfile string Optional. The name of the file that the error occurred in. $errline integer Optional. The line number where the error occurred. $errcontext string Optional. An array that points to the symbol table that was active when the error occurred. Return values Returns null regardless of result. Examples Collect errors that are not handled automatically Track errors that aren't reported automatically or that aren't PHP errors. In this example, an error is sent to the PHP agent if an unknown user accesses your app. try { //Add your code that may throw an error here. } catch (UserNotFoundException $e) { newrelic_notice_error($e); //Handle normally. } Copy Report exceptions from your own exception handler Make the PHP agent notice exceptions from within your own exception handler. function example_exception_handler($ex) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error($ex); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.6 or higher) PHP version 5.6 or higher: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error(...func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.5 or lower) PHP version 5.5 or lower: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { call_user_func_array('newrelic_notice_error', func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 6 or higher Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. Debian 7.0 (\"wheezy\") or higher Ubuntu LTS 14.04 (\"Trusty Tahr\") or higher or Ubuntu non-LTS 19.04 (\"Disco Dingo\") or higher. Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Joomla 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

Solution If no data appears after you generate traffic to your app and wait at least five minutes, use New Relic Diagnostics to automatically detect common problems and suggest troubleshooting. If that does not solve the problem, try the following: PHP agent troubleshooting Comments Compatibility Make sure your system meets the PHP agent's compatibility and requirements. Non-standard PHP version If you are using a non-standard version of PHP, follow the advanced installation procedures to make sure the default installer can find your version of PHP. App name Make sure your apps have a descriptive, unique name. For example, if you have multiple apps with the same name, such as the default app name PHP Application, data from each of these apps rolls up into the default app name, and it may appear as if an individual app is not reporting.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 6 or higher Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. Debian 7.0 (\"wheezy\") or higher Ubuntu LTS 14.04 (\"Trusty Tahr\") or higher or Ubuntu non-LTS 19.04 (\"Disco Dingo\") or higher. Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Joomla 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 6 or higher Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. Debian 7.0 (\"wheezy\") or higher Ubuntu LTS 14.04 (\"Trusty Tahr\") or higher or Ubuntu non-LTS 19.04 (\"Disco Dingo\") or higher. Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Joomla 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

Solution If no data appears after you generate traffic to your app and wait at least five minutes, use New Relic Diagnostics to automatically detect common problems and suggest troubleshooting. If that does not solve the problem, try the following: PHP agent troubleshooting Comments Compatibility Make sure your system meets the PHP agent's compatibility and requirements. Non-standard PHP version If you are using a non-standard version of PHP, follow the advanced installation procedures to make sure the default installer can find your version of PHP. App name Make sure your apps have a descriptive, unique name. For example, if you have multiple apps with the same name, such as the default app name PHP Application, data from each of these apps rolls up into the default app name, and it may appear as if an individual app is not reporting. Web server Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.), and wait a few minutes for data to appear. phpinfo() Check phpinfo() to verify that you installed the PHP agent and that the license key in it is correct. SELinux If your system uses SELinux, configure SELinux to work with the PHP agent. Log files Verify that both the agent and the daemon are writing to their log files. If not, reinstall the agent. Verify the log file permissions to make sure the log owner is the same as the New Relic user. PHP agent permissions Make sure you have the correct permissions to use the PHP agent.

Requirements Agent version 2.6 or higher. Caution If you include an exception ($e), there are differences depending on the PHP version you are using: PHP version 5 or lower: You must pass a valid PHP Exception class. PHP version 7 or higher: You must pass a valid PHP Throwable interface. Description The PHP agent handles PHP errors and exceptions automatically for supported frameworks. If you want to collect errors that are not handled automatically so that you can query for those errors in New Relic and view error traces, you can use newrelic_notice_error. If you want to use your own error and exception handlers, you can set newrelic_notice_error as the callback. Collect errors that are not handled automatically To collect errors that the PHP agent does not handle automatically, such as non-PHP errors, add this call to the function that you want to report on: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Important When there are multiple calls to this function in a single transaction, the PHP agent retains the exception from the last call only. Set the callback for your own error and exception handler To use your own handler, use these calls to make sure that the PHP agent notices the errors and exceptions from within your handler. set_exception_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_exception_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy set_error_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_error_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameters This function can handle a variable number of parameters.

Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

Solution If no data appears after you generate traffic to your app and wait at least five minutes, use New Relic Diagnostics to automatically detect common problems and suggest troubleshooting. If that does not solve the problem, try the following: PHP agent troubleshooting Comments Compatibility Make sure your system meets the PHP agent's compatibility and requirements. Non-standard PHP version If you are using a non-standard version of PHP, follow the advanced installation procedures to make sure the default installer can find your version of PHP. App name Make sure your apps have a descriptive, unique name. For example, if you have multiple apps with the same name, such as the default app name PHP Application, data from each of these apps rolls up into the default app name, and it may appear as if an individual app is not reporting. Web server Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.), and wait a few minutes for data to appear. phpinfo() Check phpinfo() to verify that you installed the PHP agent and that the license key in it is correct. SELinux If your system uses SELinux, configure SELinux to work with the PHP agent. Log files Verify that both the agent and the daemon are writing to their log files. If not, reinstall the agent. Verify the log file permissions to make sure the log owner is the same as the New Relic user. PHP agent permissions Make sure you have the correct permissions to use the PHP agent.

Requirements Agent version 2.6 or higher. Caution If you include an exception ($e), there are differences depending on the PHP version you are using: PHP version 5 or lower: You must pass a valid PHP Exception class. PHP version 7 or higher: You must pass a valid PHP Throwable interface. Description The PHP agent handles PHP errors and exceptions automatically for supported frameworks. If you want to collect errors that are not handled automatically so that you can query for those errors in New Relic and view error traces, you can use newrelic_notice_error. If you want to use your own error and exception handlers, you can set newrelic_notice_error as the callback. Collect errors that are not handled automatically To collect errors that the PHP agent does not handle automatically, such as non-PHP errors, add this call to the function that you want to report on: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Important When there are multiple calls to this function in a single transaction, the PHP agent retains the exception from the last call only. Set the callback for your own error and exception handler To use your own handler, use these calls to make sure that the PHP agent notices the errors and exceptions from within your handler. set_exception_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_exception_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy set_error_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_error_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameters This function can handle a variable number of parameters. You can pass-in 1 or 5 parameters, depending on your use case. newrelic_notice_error(string $message) Copy Parameter Description $message string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Parameter Description $e exception Required. Defaults to null. The agent uses Exception or Throwable to capture the stack frame and set the error class to the exception class name. If null or omitted, the agent reports an \"exception\" in the same format created by Exception::__toString. newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameter Description $errno integer Required. The predefined level of the error, expressed as an integer. $errstr string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. $errfile string Optional. The name of the file that the error occurred in. $errline integer Optional. The line number where the error occurred. $errcontext string Optional. An array that points to the symbol table that was active when the error occurred. Return values Returns null regardless of result. Examples Collect errors that are not handled automatically Track errors that aren't reported automatically or that aren't PHP errors. In this example, an error is sent to the PHP agent if an unknown user accesses your app. try { //Add your code that may throw an error here. } catch (UserNotFoundException $e) { newrelic_notice_error($e); //Handle normally. } Copy Report exceptions from your own exception handler Make the PHP agent notice exceptions from within your own exception handler. function example_exception_handler($ex) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error($ex); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.6 or higher) PHP version 5.6 or higher: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error(...func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.5 or lower) PHP version 5.5 or lower: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { call_user_func_array('newrelic_notice_error', func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Requirements Agent version 2.6 or higher. Caution If you include an exception ($e), there are differences depending on the PHP version you are using: PHP version 5 or lower: You must pass a valid PHP Exception class. PHP version 7 or higher: You must pass a valid PHP Throwable interface. Description The PHP agent handles PHP errors and exceptions automatically for supported frameworks. If you want to collect errors that are not handled automatically so that you can query for those errors in New Relic and view error traces, you can use newrelic_notice_error. If you want to use your own error and exception handlers, you can set newrelic_notice_error as the callback.

Set the callback for your own error and exception handler To use your own handler, use these calls to make sure that the PHP agent notices the errors and exceptions from within your handler. set_exception_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_exception_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy set_error_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_error_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameters This function can handle a variable number of parameters. You can pass-in 1 or 5 parameters, depending on your use case. newrelic_notice_error(string $message) Copy Parameter Description $message string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Parameter Description $e exception Required. Defaults to null. The agent uses Exception or Throwable to capture the stack frame and set the error class to the exception class name. If null or omitted, the agent reports an \"exception\" in the same format created by Exception::__toString. newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameter Description $errno integer Required. The predefined level of the error, expressed as an integer. $errstr string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. $errfile string Optional. The name of the file that the error occurred in. $errline integer Optional. The line number where the error occurred. $errcontext string Optional. An array that points to the symbol table that was active when the error occurred. Return values Returns null regardless of result. Examples Collect errors that are not handled automatically Track errors that aren't reported automatically or that aren't PHP errors. In this example, an error is sent to the PHP agent if an unknown user accesses your app. try { //Add your code that may throw an error here. } catch (UserNotFoundException $e) { newrelic_notice_error($e); //Handle normally. } Copy Report exceptions from your own exception handler Make the PHP agent notice exceptions from within your own exception handler. function example_exception_handler($ex) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error($ex); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.6 or higher) PHP version 5.6 or higher: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error(...func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.5 or lower) PHP version 5.5 or lower: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { call_user_func_array('newrelic_notice_error', func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 6 or higher Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. Debian 7.0 (\"wheezy\") or higher Ubuntu LTS 14.04 (\"Trusty Tahr\") or higher or Ubuntu non-LTS 19.04 (\"Disco Dingo\") or higher. Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Joomla 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

Set the callback for your own error and exception handler To use your own handler, use these calls to make sure that the PHP agent notices the errors and exceptions from within your handler. set_exception_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_exception_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy set_error_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_error_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameters This function can handle a variable number of parameters. You can pass-in 1 or 5 parameters, depending on your use case. newrelic_notice_error(string $message) Copy Parameter Description $message string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Parameter Description $e exception Required. Defaults to null. The agent uses Exception or Throwable to capture the stack frame and set the error class to the exception class name. If null or omitted, the agent reports an \"exception\" in the same format created by Exception::__toString. newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameter Description $errno integer Required. The predefined level of the error, expressed as an integer. $errstr string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. $errfile string Optional. The name of the file that the error occurred in. $errline integer Optional. The line number where the error occurred. $errcontext string Optional. An array that points to the symbol table that was active when the error occurred. Return values Returns null regardless of result. Examples Collect errors that are not handled automatically Track errors that aren't reported automatically or that aren't PHP errors. In this example, an error is sent to the PHP agent if an unknown user accesses your app. try { //Add your code that may throw an error here. } catch (UserNotFoundException $e) { newrelic_notice_error($e); //Handle normally. } Copy Report exceptions from your own exception handler Make the PHP agent notice exceptions from within your own exception handler. function example_exception_handler($ex) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error($ex); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.6 or higher) PHP version 5.6 or higher: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error(...func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.5 or lower) PHP version 5.5 or lower: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { call_user_func_array('newrelic_notice_error', func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 6 or higher Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. Debian 7.0 (\"wheezy\") or higher Ubuntu LTS 14.04 (\"Trusty Tahr\") or higher or Ubuntu non-LTS 19.04 (\"Disco Dingo\") or higher. Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Joomla 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

Solution If no data appears after you generate traffic to your app and wait at least five minutes, use New Relic Diagnostics to automatically detect common problems and suggest troubleshooting. If that does not solve the problem, try the following: PHP agent troubleshooting Comments Compatibility Make sure your system meets the PHP agent's compatibility and requirements. Non-standard PHP version If you are using a non-standard version of PHP, follow the advanced installation procedures to make sure the default installer can find your version of PHP. App name Make sure your apps have a descriptive, unique name. For example, if you have multiple apps with the same name, such as the default app name PHP Application, data from each of these apps rolls up into the default app name, and it may appear as if an individual app is not reporting. Web server Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.), and wait a few minutes for data to appear. phpinfo() Check phpinfo() to verify that you installed the PHP agent and that the license key in it is correct. SELinux If your system uses SELinux, configure SELinux to work with the PHP agent. Log files Verify that both the agent and the daemon are writing to their log files. If not, reinstall the agent. Verify the log file permissions to make sure the log owner is the same as the New Relic user. PHP agent permissions Make sure you have the correct permissions to use the PHP agent.

Solution If no data appears after you generate traffic to your app and wait at least five minutes, use New Relic Diagnostics to automatically detect common problems and suggest troubleshooting. If that does not solve the problem, try the following: PHP agent troubleshooting Comments Compatibility Make sure your system meets the PHP agent's compatibility and requirements. Non-standard PHP version If you are using a non-standard version of PHP, follow the advanced installation procedures to make sure the default installer can find your version of PHP. App name Make sure your apps have a descriptive, unique name. For example, if you have multiple apps with the same name, such as the default app name PHP Application, data from each of these apps rolls up into the default app name, and it may appear as if an individual app is not reporting. Web server Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.), and wait a few minutes for data to appear. phpinfo() Check phpinfo() to verify that you installed the PHP agent and that the license key in it is correct. SELinux If your system uses SELinux, configure SELinux to work with the PHP agent. Log files Verify that both the agent and the daemon are writing to their log files. If not, reinstall the agent. Verify the log file permissions to make sure the log owner is the same as the New Relic user. PHP agent permissions Make sure you have the correct permissions to use the PHP agent.

Requirements Agent version 2.6 or higher. Caution If you include an exception ($e), there are differences depending on the PHP version you are using: PHP version 5 or lower: You must pass a valid PHP Exception class. PHP version 7 or higher: You must pass a valid PHP Throwable interface. Description The PHP agent handles PHP errors and exceptions automatically for supported frameworks. If you want to collect errors that are not handled automatically so that you can query for those errors in New Relic and view error traces, you can use newrelic_notice_error. If you want to use your own error and exception handlers, you can set newrelic_notice_error as the callback. Collect errors that are not handled automatically To collect errors that the PHP agent does not handle automatically, such as non-PHP errors, add this call to the function that you want to report on: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Important When there are multiple calls to this function in a single transaction, the PHP agent retains the exception from the last call only. Set the callback for your own error and exception handler To use your own handler, use these calls to make sure that the PHP agent notices the errors and exceptions from within your handler. set_exception_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_exception_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy set_error_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_error_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameters This function can handle a variable number of parameters. You can pass-in 1 or 5 parameters, depending on your use case. newrelic_notice_error(string $message) Copy Parameter Description $message string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Parameter Description $e exception Required. Defaults to null. The agent uses Exception or Throwable to capture the stack frame and set the error class to the exception class name. If null or omitted, the agent reports an \"exception\" in the same format created by Exception::__toString. newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameter Description $errno integer Required. The predefined level of the error, expressed as an integer. $errstr string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. $errfile string Optional. The name of the file that the error occurred in. $errline integer Optional. The line number where the error occurred. $errcontext string Optional. An array that points to the symbol table that was active when the error occurred. Return values Returns null regardless of result. Examples Collect errors that are not handled automatically Track errors that aren't reported automatically or that aren't PHP errors. In this example, an error is sent to the PHP agent if an unknown user accesses your app. try { //Add your code that may throw an error here. } catch (UserNotFoundException $e) { newrelic_notice_error($e); //Handle normally. } Copy Report exceptions from your own exception handler Make the PHP agent notice exceptions from within your own exception handler. function example_exception_handler($ex) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error($ex); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.6 or higher) PHP version 5.6 or higher: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error(...func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.5 or lower) PHP version 5.5 or lower: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { call_user_func_array('newrelic_notice_error', func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "Problem After installing the New Relic PHP agent, generating some traffic, and waiting at least five minutes, no data appears in your New Relic UI. Solution If no data appears after you generate traffic to your app and wait at least five minutes, use New Relic Diagnostics to automatically detect common problems and suggest troubleshooting. If that does not solve the problem, try the following: PHP agent troubleshooting Comments Compatibility Make sure your system meets the PHP agent's compatibility and requirements. Non-standard PHP version If you are using a non-standard version of PHP, follow the advanced installation procedures to make sure the default installer can find your version of PHP. App name Make sure your apps have a descriptive, unique name. For example, if you have multiple apps with the same name, such as the default app name PHP Application, data from each of these apps rolls up into the default app name, and it may appear as if an individual app is not reporting. Web server Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.), and wait a few minutes for data to appear. phpinfo() Check phpinfo() to verify that you installed the PHP agent and that the license key in it is correct. SELinux If your system uses SELinux, configure SELinux to work with the PHP agent. Log files Verify that both the agent and the daemon are writing to their log files. If not, reinstall the agent. Verify the log file permissions to make sure the log owner is the same as the New Relic user. PHP agent permissions Make sure you have the correct permissions to use the PHP agent. Other If none of these solutions solve the problem, see the troubleshooting procedures for: Agent stops after you update PHP After previously reporting data, the PHP agent stops reporting For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Requirements Agent version 2.6 or higher. Caution If you include an exception ($e), there are differences depending on the PHP version you are using: PHP version 5 or lower: You must pass a valid PHP Exception class. PHP version 7 or higher: You must pass a valid PHP Throwable interface. Description The PHP agent handles PHP errors and exceptions automatically for supported frameworks. If you want to collect errors that are not handled automatically so that you can query for those errors in New Relic and view error traces, you can use newrelic_notice_error. If you want to use your own error and exception handlers, you can set newrelic_notice_error as the callback. Collect errors that are not handled automatically To collect errors that the PHP agent does not handle automatically, such as non-PHP errors, add this call to the function that you want to report on: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Important When there are multiple calls to this function in a single transaction, the PHP agent retains the exception from the last call only. Set the callback for your own error and exception handler To use your own handler, use these calls to make sure that the PHP agent notices the errors and exceptions from within your handler. set_exception_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_exception_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy set_error_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_error_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameters This function can handle a variable number of parameters. You can pass-in 1 or 5 parameters, depending on your use case. newrelic_notice_error(string $message) Copy Parameter Description $message string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Parameter Description $e exception Required. Defaults to null. The agent uses Exception or Throwable to capture the stack frame and set the error class to the exception class name. If null or omitted, the agent reports an \"exception\" in the same format created by Exception::__toString. newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameter Description $errno integer Required. The predefined level of the error, expressed as an integer. $errstr string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. $errfile string Optional. The name of the file that the error occurred in. $errline integer Optional. The line number where the error occurred. $errcontext string Optional. An array that points to the symbol table that was active when the error occurred. Return values Returns null regardless of result. Examples Collect errors that are not handled automatically Track errors that aren't reported automatically or that aren't PHP errors. In this example, an error is sent to the PHP agent if an unknown user accesses your app. try { //Add your code that may throw an error here. } catch (UserNotFoundException $e) { newrelic_notice_error($e); //Handle normally. } Copy Report exceptions from your own exception handler Make the PHP agent notice exceptions from within your own exception handler. function example_exception_handler($ex) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error($ex); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.6 or higher) PHP version 5.6 or higher: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error(...func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.5 or lower) PHP version 5.5 or lower: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { call_user_func_array('newrelic_notice_error', func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 6 or higher Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. Debian 7.0 (\"wheezy\") or higher Ubuntu LTS 14.04 (\"Trusty Tahr\") or higher or Ubuntu non-LTS 19.04 (\"Disco Dingo\") or higher. Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Joomla 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

If you want to use your own error and exception handlers, you can set newrelic_notice_error as the callback. Collect errors that are not handled automatically To collect errors that the PHP agent does not handle automatically, such as non-PHP errors, add this call to the function that you want to report on: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Important When there are multiple calls to this function in a single transaction, the PHP agent retains the exception from the last call only. Set the callback for your own error and exception handler To use your own handler, use these calls to make sure that the PHP agent notices the errors and exceptions from within your handler. set_exception_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_exception_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy set_error_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_error_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameters This function can handle a variable number of parameters. You can pass-in 1 or 5 parameters, depending on your use case. newrelic_notice_error(string $message) Copy Parameter Description $message string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Parameter Description $e exception Required. Defaults to null. The agent uses Exception or Throwable to capture the stack frame and set the error class to the exception class name. If null or omitted, the agent reports an \"exception\" in the same format created by Exception::__toString. newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameter Description $errno integer Required. The predefined level of the error, expressed as an integer. $errstr string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. $errfile string Optional. The name of the file that the error occurred in. $errline integer Optional. The line number where the error occurred. $errcontext string Optional. An array that points to the symbol table that was active when the error occurred. Return values Returns null regardless of result. Examples Collect errors that are not handled automatically Track errors that aren't reported automatically or that aren't PHP errors. In this example, an error is sent to the PHP agent if an unknown user accesses your app. try { //Add your code that may throw an error here. } catch (UserNotFoundException $e) { newrelic_notice_error($e); //Handle normally. } Copy Report exceptions from your own exception handler Make the PHP agent notice exceptions from within your own exception handler. function example_exception_handler($ex) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error($ex); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.6 or higher) PHP version 5.6 or higher: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error(...func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.5 or lower) PHP version 5.5 or lower: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { call_user_func_array('newrelic_notice_error', func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 6 or higher Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. Debian 7.0 (\"wheezy\") or higher Ubuntu LTS 14.04 (\"Trusty Tahr\") or higher or Ubuntu non-LTS 19.04 (\"Disco Dingo\") or higher. Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Joomla 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

Requirements Agent version 2.6 or higher. Caution If you include an exception ($e), there are differences depending on the PHP version you are using: PHP version 5 or lower: You must pass a valid PHP Exception class. PHP version 7 or higher: You must pass a valid PHP Throwable interface. Description The PHP agent handles PHP errors and exceptions automatically for supported frameworks. If you want to collect errors that are not handled automatically so that you can query for those errors in New Relic and view error traces, you can use newrelic_notice_error. If you want to use your own error and exception handlers, you can set newrelic_notice_error as the callback. Collect errors that are not handled automatically To collect errors that the PHP agent does not handle automatically, such as non-PHP errors, add this call to the function that you want to report on: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Important When there are multiple calls to this function in a single transaction, the PHP agent retains the exception from the last call only. Set the callback for your own error and exception handler To use your own handler, use these calls to make sure that the PHP agent notices the errors and exceptions from within your handler. set_exception_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_exception_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy set_error_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_error_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameters This function can handle a variable number of parameters. You can pass-in 1 or 5 parameters, depending on your use case. newrelic_notice_error(string $message) Copy Parameter Description $message string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Parameter Description $e exception Required. Defaults to null. The agent uses Exception or Throwable to capture the stack frame and set the error class to the exception class name. If null or omitted, the agent reports an \"exception\" in the same format created by Exception::__toString. newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameter Description $errno integer Required. The predefined level of the error, expressed as an integer. $errstr string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. $errfile string Optional. The name of the file that the error occurred in. $errline integer Optional. The line number where the error occurred. $errcontext string Optional. An array that points to the symbol table that was active when the error occurred. Return values Returns null regardless of result. Examples Collect errors that are not handled automatically Track errors that aren't reported automatically or that aren't PHP errors. In this example, an error is sent to the PHP agent if an unknown user accesses your app. try { //Add your code that may throw an error here. } catch (UserNotFoundException $e) { newrelic_notice_error($e); //Handle normally. } Copy Report exceptions from your own exception handler Make the PHP agent notice exceptions from within your own exception handler. function example_exception_handler($ex) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error($ex); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.6 or higher) PHP version 5.6 or higher: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error(...func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.5 or lower) PHP version 5.5 or lower: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { call_user_func_array('newrelic_notice_error', func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Requirements Agent version 2.6 or higher. Caution If you include an exception ($e), there are differences depending on the PHP version you are using: PHP version 5 or lower: You must pass a valid PHP Exception class. PHP version 7 or higher: You must pass a valid PHP Throwable interface. Description The PHP agent handles PHP errors and exceptions automatically for supported frameworks. If you want to collect errors that are not handled automatically so that you can query for those errors in New Relic and view error traces, you can use newrelic_notice_error. If you want to use your own error and exception handlers, you can set newrelic_notice_error as the callback. Collect errors that are not handled automatically To collect errors that the PHP agent does not handle automatically, such as non-PHP errors, add this call to the function that you want to report on: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Important When there are multiple calls to this function in a single transaction, the PHP agent retains the exception from the last call only. Set the callback for your own error and exception handler To use your own handler, use these calls to make sure that the PHP agent notices the errors and exceptions from within your handler. set_exception_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_exception_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy set_error_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_error_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameters This function can handle a variable number of parameters. You can pass-in 1 or 5 parameters, depending on your use case. newrelic_notice_error(string $message) Copy Parameter Description $message string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Parameter Description $e exception Required. Defaults to null. The agent uses Exception or Throwable to capture the stack frame and set the error class to the exception class name. If null or omitted, the agent reports an \"exception\" in the same format created by Exception::__toString. newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameter Description $errno integer Required. The predefined level of the error, expressed as an integer. $errstr string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. $errfile string Optional. The name of the file that the error occurred in. $errline integer Optional. The line number where the error occurred. $errcontext string Optional. An array that points to the symbol table that was active when the error occurred. Return values Returns null regardless of result. Examples Collect errors that are not handled automatically Track errors that aren't reported automatically or that aren't PHP errors. In this example, an error is sent to the PHP agent if an unknown user accesses your app. try { //Add your code that may throw an error here. } catch (UserNotFoundException $e) { newrelic_notice_error($e); //Handle normally. } Copy Report exceptions from your own exception handler Make the PHP agent notice exceptions from within your own exception handler. function example_exception_handler($ex) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error($ex); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.6 or higher) PHP version 5.6 or higher: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error(...func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.5 or lower) PHP version 5.5 or lower: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { call_user_func_array('newrelic_notice_error', func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 6 or higher Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. Debian 7.0 (\"wheezy\") or higher Ubuntu LTS 14.04 (\"Trusty Tahr\") or higher or Ubuntu non-LTS 19.04 (\"Disco Dingo\") or higher. Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Joomla 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 6 or higher Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. Debian 7.0 (\"wheezy\") or higher Ubuntu LTS 14.04 (\"Trusty Tahr\") or higher or Ubuntu non-LTS 19.04 (\"Disco Dingo\") or higher. Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Joomla 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

Solution If no data appears after you generate traffic to your app and wait at least five minutes, use New Relic Diagnostics to automatically detect common problems and suggest troubleshooting. If that does not solve the problem, try the following: PHP agent troubleshooting Comments Compatibility Make sure your system meets the PHP agent's compatibility and requirements. Non-standard PHP version If you are using a non-standard version of PHP, follow the advanced installation procedures to make sure the default installer can find your version of PHP. App name Make sure your apps have a descriptive, unique name. For example, if you have multiple apps with the same name, such as the default app name PHP Application, data from each of these apps rolls up into the default app name, and it may appear as if an individual app is not reporting. Web server Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.), and wait a few minutes for data to appear. phpinfo() Check phpinfo() to verify that you installed the PHP agent and that the license key in it is correct. SELinux If your system uses SELinux, configure SELinux to work with the PHP agent. Log files Verify that both the agent and the daemon are writing to their log files. If not, reinstall the agent. Verify the log file permissions to make sure the log owner is the same as the New Relic user. PHP agent permissions Make sure you have the correct permissions to use the PHP agent. Other If none of these solutions solve the problem, see the troubleshooting procedures for: Agent stops after you update PHP After previously reporting data, the PHP agent stops reporting For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Solution If no data appears after you generate traffic to your app and wait at least five minutes, use New Relic Diagnostics to automatically detect common problems and suggest troubleshooting. If that does not solve the problem, try the following: PHP agent troubleshooting Comments Compatibility Make sure your system meets the PHP agent's compatibility and requirements. Non-standard PHP version If you are using a non-standard version of PHP, follow the advanced installation procedures to make sure the default installer can find your version of PHP. App name Make sure your apps have a descriptive, unique name. For example, if you have multiple apps with the same name, such as the default app name PHP Application, data from each of these apps rolls up into the default app name, and it may appear as if an individual app is not reporting. Web server Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.), and wait a few minutes for data to appear. phpinfo() Check phpinfo() to verify that you installed the PHP agent and that the license key in it is correct. SELinux If your system uses SELinux, configure SELinux to work with the PHP agent. Log files Verify that both the agent and the daemon are writing to their log files. If not, reinstall the agent. Verify the log file permissions to make sure the log owner is the same as the New Relic user. PHP agent permissions Make sure you have the correct permissions to use the PHP agent.

Requirements Agent version 2.6 or higher. Caution If you include an exception ($e), there are differences depending on the PHP version you are using: PHP version 5 or lower: You must pass a valid PHP Exception class. PHP version 7 or higher: You must pass a valid PHP Throwable interface. Description The PHP agent handles PHP errors and exceptions automatically for supported frameworks. If you want to collect errors that are not handled automatically so that you can query for those errors in New Relic and view error traces, you can use newrelic_notice_error. If you want to use your own error and exception handlers, you can set newrelic_notice_error as the callback. Collect errors that are not handled automatically To collect errors that the PHP agent does not handle automatically, such as non-PHP errors, add this call to the function that you want to report on: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Important When there are multiple calls to this function in a single transaction, the PHP agent retains the exception from the last call only. Set the callback for your own error and exception handler To use your own handler, use these calls to make sure that the PHP agent notices the errors and exceptions from within your handler. set_exception_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_exception_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy set_error_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_error_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameters This function can handle a variable number of parameters. You can pass-in 1 or 5 parameters, depending on your use case. newrelic_notice_error(string $message) Copy Parameter Description $message string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Parameter Description $e exception Required. Defaults to null. The agent uses Exception or Throwable to capture the stack frame and set the error class to the exception class name. If null or omitted, the agent reports an \"exception\" in the same format created by Exception::__toString. newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameter Description $errno integer Required. The predefined level of the error, expressed as an integer. $errstr string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. $errfile string Optional. The name of the file that the error occurred in. $errline integer Optional. The line number where the error occurred. $errcontext string Optional. An array that points to the symbol table that was active when the error occurred. Return values Returns null regardless of result. Examples Collect errors that are not handled automatically Track errors that aren't reported automatically or that aren't PHP errors. In this example, an error is sent to the PHP agent if an unknown user accesses your app. try { //Add your code that may throw an error here. } catch (UserNotFoundException $e) { newrelic_notice_error($e); //Handle normally. } Copy Report exceptions from your own exception handler Make the PHP agent notice exceptions from within your own exception handler. function example_exception_handler($ex) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error($ex); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.6 or higher) PHP version 5.6 or higher: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error(...func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.5 or lower) PHP version 5.5 or lower: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { call_user_func_array('newrelic_notice_error', func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

Requirements Agent version 2.6 or higher. Caution If you include an exception ($e), there are differences depending on the PHP version you are using: PHP version 5 or lower: You must pass a valid PHP Exception class. PHP version 7 or higher: You must pass a valid PHP Throwable interface. Description The PHP agent handles PHP errors and exceptions automatically for supported frameworks. If you want to collect errors that are not handled automatically so that you can query for those errors in New Relic and view error traces, you can use newrelic_notice_error. If you want to use your own error and exception handlers, you can set newrelic_notice_error as the callback. Collect errors that are not handled automatically To collect errors that the PHP agent does not handle automatically, such as non-PHP errors, add this call to the function that you want to report on: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Important When there are multiple calls to this function in a single transaction, the PHP agent retains the exception from the last call only. Set the callback for your own error and exception handler To use your own handler, use these calls to make sure that the PHP agent notices the errors and exceptions from within your handler. set_exception_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_exception_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy set_error_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_error_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameters This function can handle a variable number of parameters. You can pass-in 1 or 5 parameters, depending on your use case. newrelic_notice_error(string $message) Copy Parameter Description $message string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Parameter Description $e exception Required. Defaults to null. The agent uses Exception or Throwable to capture the stack frame and set the error class to the exception class name. If null or omitted, the agent reports an \"exception\" in the same format created by Exception::__toString. newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameter Description $errno integer Required. The predefined level of the error, expressed as an integer. $errstr string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. $errfile string Optional. The name of the file that the error occurred in. $errline integer Optional. The line number where the error occurred. $errcontext string Optional. An array that points to the symbol table that was active when the error occurred. Return values Returns null regardless of result. Examples Collect errors that are not handled automatically Track errors that aren't reported automatically or that aren't PHP errors. In this example, an error is sent to the PHP agent if an unknown user accesses your app. try { //Add your code that may throw an error here. } catch (UserNotFoundException $e) { newrelic_notice_error($e); //Handle normally. } Copy Report exceptions from your own exception handler Make the PHP agent notice exceptions from within your own exception handler. function example_exception_handler($ex) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error($ex); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.6 or higher) PHP version 5.6 or higher: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error(...func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.5 or lower) PHP version 5.5 or lower: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { call_user_func_array('newrelic_notice_error', func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 6 or higher Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. Debian 7.0 (\"wheezy\") or higher Ubuntu LTS 14.04 (\"Trusty Tahr\") or higher or Ubuntu non-LTS 19.04 (\"Disco Dingo\") or higher. Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Joomla 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

Requirements Agent version 2.6 or higher. Caution If you include an exception ($e), there are differences depending on the PHP version you are using: PHP version 5 or lower: You must pass a valid PHP Exception class. PHP version 7 or higher: You must pass a valid PHP Throwable interface. Description The PHP agent handles PHP errors and exceptions automatically for supported frameworks. If you want to collect errors that are not handled automatically so that you can query for those errors in New Relic and view error traces, you can use newrelic_notice_error. If you want to use your own error and exception handlers, you can set newrelic_notice_error as the callback. Collect errors that are not handled automatically To collect errors that the PHP agent does not handle automatically, such as non-PHP errors, add this call to the function that you want to report on: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Important When there are multiple calls to this function in a single transaction, the PHP agent retains the exception from the last call only.

      "body": "Before you install New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. PHP releases New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. Important Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 detects the New Relic agent, it disables Just-In-Time compilation. We recommend using a supported release of PHP, especially 7.3, 7.4, and 8.0. PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5. PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0. PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release 9.15 of the agent, and removed in release 9.17. Permissions Installation: Root access is required for most installations. Running: Root access is not required. License key For any installation, you will need your New Relic license key. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you sign up for your account. For more information, see the PHP install script and license key settings in the PHP INI file. Processor type Intel (and compatible) platforms only Support for SSE2 instructions is required Operating systems Important The Windows operating system is not supported. Operating system Supported by New Relic's PHP agent Linux (x86 and x86_64) AWS Linux 2 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or higher CentOS 6 or higher Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for CentOS 5. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. Debian 7.0 (\"wheezy\") or higher Ubuntu LTS 14.04 (\"Trusty Tahr\") or higher or Ubuntu non-LTS 19.04 (\"Disco Dingo\") or higher. Any other Linux distribution with: Kernel version 2.6.13 or higher (2.6.26 or higher highly recommended) glibc 2.5 or higher with NPTL support; or musl libc version 1.1 or higher macOS (x86_64 only) Important As of January 2021, we will discontinue support for macOS. For more information, see our PHP agent release notes v9.15.0 and our Explorers Hub post. macOS 10.6 or higher (See macOS troubleshooting notes.) Since modern versions of macOS can't run 32-bit applications, New Relic removed support for 32-bit macOS with PHP agent release 4.6. FreeBSD (x64) The latest agent supports the latest Production Release. SmartOS and Solaris (x64) (DEPRECATED) Last supported PHP Agent for Solaris and SmartOS is 8.1 SmartOS: All versions OpenSolaris 10: snv_134b or higher Must use i86pc architecture. SPARC architectures are not supported. Web servers Apache 2.2 or 2.4 via mod_php Any web server that supports FastCGI using PHP-FPM Frameworks Supported PHP frameworks include: Frameworks CakePHP 2.x Magento 1.x and 2.x, CE and EE CodeIgniter 2.x MediaWiki Drupal 6.x, 7.x, 8.x, and 9.x Joomla 3.x Slim 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x Kohana 3.2 and 3.3 Symfony 3.x, 4.x, 5.x Laminas 3.x Wordpress Laravel 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x Yii 1.x Laravel Lumen 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x Zend Framework 1.x, 2.x, and 3.x Important Joomla 3.x is not supported on PHP 8. Important As of PHP agent version 9.17, the following frameworks or framework versions are no longer supported and may be removed from future agent builds: Cake PHP 1.x Joomla 1.5, 1.6, and 2.x Kohana Silex 1.x and 2.x Symfony 1.x and 2.x The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app. For more information, see PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic. If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the Explorers Hub and create a Feature Idea! Databases and libraries Supported databases and libraries: Databases and Libraries Firebird Oracle Guzzle PHPUnit Informix PDO Memcached Postgres MongoDB Predis Microsoft SQL Server Redis MySQL SQLite ODBC Sybase Other APM software If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see Errors when using other monitoring software. Instance details New Relic collects instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version. New Relic's PHP agent version 6.8 or higher supports instance details for the following: Database Extension Minimum agent version MongoDB mongodb 7.1 MySQL mysql 6.8 MySQL mysqli 6.8 MySQL pdo_mysql 6.8 PostgreSQL pgsql 6.9 PostgreSQL pdo_pgsql 6.9 Redis predis 7.1 Redis redis 7.1 To disable collection of host information, use either of these options: Set newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled to false in the newrelic.ini. Omit the database name with newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false. To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

Solution If no data appears after you generate traffic to your app and wait at least five minutes, use New Relic Diagnostics to automatically detect common problems and suggest troubleshooting. If that does not solve the problem, try the following: PHP agent troubleshooting Comments Compatibility Make sure your system meets the PHP agent's compatibility and requirements. Non-standard PHP version If you are using a non-standard version of PHP, follow the advanced installation procedures to make sure the default installer can find your version of PHP. App name Make sure your apps have a descriptive, unique name. For example, if you have multiple apps with the same name, such as the default app name PHP Application, data from each of these apps rolls up into the default app name, and it may appear as if an individual app is not reporting. Web server Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.), and wait a few minutes for data to appear. phpinfo() Check phpinfo() to verify that you installed the PHP agent and that the license key in it is correct. SELinux If your system uses SELinux, configure SELinux to work with the PHP agent. Log files Verify that both the agent and the daemon are writing to their log files. If not, reinstall the agent. Verify the log file permissions to make sure the log owner is the same as the New Relic user. PHP agent permissions Make sure you have the correct permissions to use the PHP agent.

Message queuing HTTP Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release, enabled by default since PHP Agent 8.0.0.204. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility: Product Integration Browser monitoring The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the PHP agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

Requirements Agent version 2.6 or higher. Caution If you include an exception ($e), there are differences depending on the PHP version you are using: PHP version 5 or lower: You must pass a valid PHP Exception class. PHP version 7 or higher: You must pass a valid PHP Throwable interface. Description The PHP agent handles PHP errors and exceptions automatically for supported frameworks. If you want to collect errors that are not handled automatically so that you can query for those errors in New Relic and view error traces, you can use newrelic_notice_error. If you want to use your own error and exception handlers, you can set newrelic_notice_error as the callback. Collect errors that are not handled automatically To collect errors that the PHP agent does not handle automatically, such as non-PHP errors, add this call to the function that you want to report on: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Important When there are multiple calls to this function in a single transaction, the PHP agent retains the exception from the last call only. Set the callback for your own error and exception handler To use your own handler, use these calls to make sure that the PHP agent notices the errors and exceptions from within your handler. set_exception_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_exception_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy set_error_handler() To provide newrelic_notice_error as the callback for set_error_handler(), use the following: newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameters This function can handle a variable number of parameters. You can pass-in 1 or 5 parameters, depending on your use case. newrelic_notice_error(string $message) Copy Parameter Description $message string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. newrelic_notice_error(Throwable|Exception $e) Copy Parameter Description $e exception Required. Defaults to null. The agent uses Exception or Throwable to capture the stack frame and set the error class to the exception class name. If null or omitted, the agent reports an \"exception\" in the same format created by Exception::__toString. newrelic_notice_error(int $errno, string $errstr, string $errfile, int $errline, string $errcontext) Copy Parameter Description $errno integer Required. The predefined level of the error, expressed as an integer. $errstr string Required. Provide an error message that will be meaningful to you when it displays in error traces. $errfile string Optional. The name of the file that the error occurred in. $errline integer Optional. The line number where the error occurred. $errcontext string Optional. An array that points to the symbol table that was active when the error occurred. Return values Returns null regardless of result. Examples Collect errors that are not handled automatically Track errors that aren't reported automatically or that aren't PHP errors. In this example, an error is sent to the PHP agent if an unknown user accesses your app. try { //Add your code that may throw an error here. } catch (UserNotFoundException $e) { newrelic_notice_error($e); //Handle normally. } Copy Report exceptions from your own exception handler Make the PHP agent notice exceptions from within your own exception handler. function example_exception_handler($ex) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error($ex); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.6 or higher) PHP version 5.6 or higher: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { newrelic_notice_error(...func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy Report errors from your own error handler (PHP version 5.5 or lower) PHP version 5.5 or lower: Make the PHP agent notice errors from within your own error handler. function example_error_handler($errno, $errstr, $errfile = null, $errline = null, $errcontext = null) { if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { call_user_func_array('newrelic_notice_error', func_get_args()); } //Add your code here. } Copy For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

New Relic Dashboards The PHP agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.

      "body": "Problem After installing the New Relic PHP agent, generating some traffic, and waiting at least five minutes, no data appears in your New Relic UI. Solution If no data appears after you generate traffic to your app and wait at least five minutes, use New Relic Diagnostics to automatically detect common problems and suggest troubleshooting. If that does not solve the problem, try the following: PHP agent troubleshooting Comments Compatibility Make sure your system meets the PHP agent's compatibility and requirements. Non-standard PHP version If you are using a non-standard version of PHP, follow the advanced installation procedures to make sure the default installer can find your version of PHP. App name Make sure your apps have a descriptive, unique name. For example, if you have multiple apps with the same name, such as the default app name PHP Application, data from each of these apps rolls up into the default app name, and it may appear as if an individual app is not reporting. Web server Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.), and wait a few minutes for data to appear. phpinfo() Check phpinfo() to verify that you installed the PHP agent and that the license key in it is correct. SELinux If your system uses SELinux, configure SELinux to work with the PHP agent. Log files Verify that both the agent and the daemon are writing to their log files. If not, reinstall the agent. Verify the log file permissions to make sure the log owner is the same as the New Relic user. PHP agent permissions Make sure you have the correct permissions to use the PHP agent. Other If none of these solutions solve the problem, see the troubleshooting procedures for: Agent stops after you update PHP After previously reporting data, the PHP agent stops reporting For more help If you need more help, check out these support and learning resources: Suggest a change and learn how to contribute to our PHP agent open source repository.

      "body": "New Relic offers several tools to help obtain the information needed to provide useful metrics about your Node.js application. These include: Reading the route names (if used) from the Express and Restify routers Using the API to name the current request, either with simple names or groups of controllers with actions Support rules that are stored in your agent's configuration that can mark requests to be renamed or ignored based on regular expressions matched against the request's raw URLs (also available as API calls) The number of names that New Relic tracks needs to be small enough so that the user experience is robust. It also needs to be large enough to provide the right amount of information (without overwhelming you with data) so that you can identify problem spots in your applications more easily. For more information, see the Node.js agent configuration documentation and the Node.js agent API documentation on Github. Request names The Node.js agent captures the HTTP method along with a potentially parameterized path (such as /user/:id) or a regular expression (such as /^/user/([-0-9a-f]+)$/). These pieces of information become part of the request name. If you have support for slow transaction traces and have enabled capture_params in your config file, the transaction trace will also have the request's parameters and their values attached to it. If you are dissatisfied with the request names that the Node.js agent uses, you can use API calls to create more descriptive names. Tip If grouping your requests under the generic name, then /* is sufficient, and you do not need to customize your configuration file or API calls. Requirements New Relic uses request names to group requests for many charts and tables. The value of these visualizations will drop as the number of different request names increases. For example, do not include potentially dynamic data like GUIDs, numerical IDs, or timestamps in the request names you create. If your request is slow enough to generate a transaction trace, that trace will contain the original URL. If you enable parameter capture, the parameters will also be attached to the trace. Tip Avoid having more than 50 different transaction names. For example, if you have more than a couple hundred different request names, rethink your naming strategy. Avoid metric grouping issues The request naming API helps New Relic avoid problems with trying to handle too many metrics, which sometimes is referred to as \"metric explosion.\" New Relic has several strategies to deal with these issues; the most severe is simply to add offending applications to your deny list. The main reason for you to be careful in using these request-naming tools is to prevent that from happening to your applications. For more information, see Metric grouping issues. Guidelines Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general. The first rules listed in your config file or added with the Node.js transaction naming API will be applied first and should be narrowly targeted. More general \"fall-through\" rules should be added toward the end of the list, because they will be evaluated in the order they were configured or added using the Node.js transaction naming API. URL pattern matching An online retailer has a URL pattern like this: /user/customers/all/prospects /user/customers/all/current /user/customers/all/returning /user/customers/John /user/customers/Jane Copy The retailer could create rules like this: // newrelic.js exports.config={ //other configuration rules:{ name:[ { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/prospects/\", name: \"/user/customers/all/prospects\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/all/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/all\" }, { pattern: \"/user/customers/.*\", name: \"/user/customers/:customer\" } ] } } Copy With these rules, the retailer would create three transaction names: /user/customers/:customer /user/customers/all /user/customers/all/prospects If the retailer reversed the order, the rules would catch all transactions in :customer, which would not be as useful. Load the request naming API Make sure that loading the New Relic module is the first thing your application does, as it needs to bootstrap itself before the rest of your application loads: var newrelic = require('newrelic'); Copy This returns the request naming API. You can safely require the module from multiple modules in your application, as it only initializes itself once. Request API calls Here is a summary of the Request API calls for New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.setTransactionName(name) newrelic.setTransactionName(name) Copy Name the current request, following the request naming requirements. You can call this function anywhere within the context of an HTTP request handler, at any time after handling of the request has started, but before the request has finished. In general, if the request and response objects are in scope, you can set the name. Explicitly calling newrelic.setTransactionName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. newrelic.setControllerName(name, \\[action]) newrelic.setControllerName(name, \\[action]) Copy Name the current request using a controller-style pattern, optionally including the current controller action. If the action is omitted, New Relic will include the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.) as the action. The rules for when you can call newrelic.setControllerName() are the same as they are for newrelic.setTransactionName(), including the request naming requirements. Explicitly calling newrelic.setControllerName() will override any names set by Express or Restify routes. Also, calls to newrelic.setTransactionName() and newrelic.setControllerName() will overwrite each other. The last one to run before the request ends wins. Custom instrumentation API calls Use these API calls to expand your instrumentation with custom instrumentation. newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrument(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a specific module. The provided onRequire callback will be fired when the given module is loaded with require. The moduleName parameter should be the string that will be passed to require; for example, 'express' or 'amqplib/callback_api'. The optional onError callback is called if the onRequire parameters throws an error. This is useful for debugging your instrumentation. Use this method to: Add instrumentation for modules not currently instrumented by New Relic. Instrument your own code. Replace the Node.js agent's built-in instrumentation with your own. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentDatastore(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a datastore module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a datastore-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js datastore instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule(moduleName, moduleInstance) Copy The instrumentLoadedModule method allows you to add stock instrumentation to specific modules in situations where it's impossible to have require('newrelic'); as the first line of your app's main module. // load the agent const newrelic = require('newrelic') // module loaded before newrelic const expressModule = require('express') // instrument express _after_ the agent has been loaded newrelic.instrumentLoadedModule( 'express', // the module's name, as a string expressModule // the module instance ); Copy Important This method cannot instrument any arbitrary module. Its purpose is to add modules that were missed because the agent was not loaded as the first thing in your program. The instrumentLoadedModule method can only instrument modules the agent would normally instrument. You can see a list of these modules in the agent's lib/instrumentations module. newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentMessages(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a message service client module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a message-service-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js message service instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) newrelic.instrumentWebframework(moduleName, onRequire \\[, onError]) Copy Sets an instrumentation callback for a web framework module. This method is just like newrelic.instrument(), except it provides a web-framework-specialized shim. For more information, see New Relic's Node.js web framework instrumentation tutorial on Github. newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) newrelic.startWebTransaction(url, handle) Copy Instrument the specified web transaction. Using this API call, you can instrument transactions that New Relic does not automatically detect. The url defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The handle defines the function you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startWebTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, \\[group], handle) newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(name, \\[group], handle) Copy Instrument the specified background transaction. Using this API call, you can expand New Relic's instrumentation to capture data from background transactions. The name defines the transaction name and needs to be static. Do not include variable data such as user ID. The group is optional, and it allows you to group similar jobs together via the transaction type in the user interface. Like name, the group needs to be static. The handle defines a function that includes the entire background job you want to instrument. New Relic will capture any metrics that would be captured by auto-instrumentation, as well as manual instrumentation via startSegment(). You must handle custom transactions manually by calling newrelic.getTransaction() at the start of your transaction, and then call transaction.end() when you are finished. New Relic begins timing the transaction when newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction() is called and ends the transaction when transaction.end() is called. You can also return a promise to indicate the end of the transaction. Please note that if this promise rejects, it does not automatically hook into New Relic’s error tracking. This needs to be done manually with noticeError(). newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.getTransaction() Copy Returns a handle on the currently executing transaction. This handle can then be used to interact with a given transaction safely from any context. It is best used with newrelic.startWebTransaction() and newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction(). Please refer to the transaction handle section for more details. newrelic.endTransaction() newrelic.endTransaction() Copy End the current web or background custom transaction. This method requires being in the correct transaction context when called. This API call takes no arguments. newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) newrelic.startSegment(name, record, handler, callback) Copy Instrument a particular method to improve visibility into a transaction, or optionally turn it into a metric. The name defines a name for the segment. This name will be visible in transaction traces and as a new metric in the New Relic UI. The record flag defines whether the segment should be recorded as a metric. The handler is the function you want to track as a segment. The optional callback is a function passed to the handler to fire after its work is done. The agent begins timing the segment when startSegment is called. The segment is ended when either the handler finishes executing, or callback is fired, if it is provided. Custom metrics API calls Use these API calls to record additional arbitrary metrics: newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) newrelic.recordMetric(name, value) Copy Use recordMetric to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The name must be a string following standard metric naming rules. The value will usually be a number, but it can also be an object. When value is a numeric value, it should represent the magnitude of a measurement associated with an event; for example, the duration for a particular method call. When value is an object, it must contain count, total, min, max, and sumOfSquares keys, all with number values. This form is useful to aggregate metrics on your own and report them periodically; for example, from a setInterval. These values will be aggregated with any previously collected values for the same metric. The names of these keys match the names of the keys used by the platform API. newrelic.incrementMetric(name, \\[amount]) newrelic.incrementMetric(name, \\[amount]) Copy Use incrementMetric to update a metric that acts as a simple counter. The count of the selected metric will be incremented by the specified amount, defaulting to 1. Custom events API calls Use these API calls to record additional events: newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) newrelic.recordCustomEvent(eventType, attributes) Copy Use recordCustomEvent to record an event-based metric, usually associated with a particular duration. The eventType must be an alphanumeric string less than 255 characters. The attributes must be an object of key and value pairs. The keys must be shorter than 255 characters, and the values must be string, number, or boolean. Recording a custom event The following example demonstrates recording a custom event with multiple attributes. const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.recordCustomEvent('MessagingEvent', attributes) Copy Transaction handle methods This section details the methods provided by the TransactionHandle class instance that can be obtained through newrelic.getTransaction(). Use these methods to interact directly with the current transaction: transactionHandle.end(\\[callback]) transactionHandle.end(\\[callback]) Copy Use transactionHandle.end to end the transaction referenced by the handle instance. The callback is invoked when the transaction has fully ended. The finished transaction passed to the callback as the first argument. transactionHandle.ignore() transactionHandle.ignore() Copy Use transactionHandle.ignore to ignore the transaction referenced by the handle instance. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call acceptDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.insertDistributedTraceHeaders is used to implement distributed tracing. It modifies the headers map that is passed in by adding W3C Trace Context headers and New Relic Distributed Trace headers. The New Relic headers can be disabled with distributed_tracing.exclude_newrelic_header: true in the config. This method replaces the deprecated createDistributedTracePayload method, which only creates New Relic Distributed Trace payloads. Generating distributed trace headers In the following example, by calling insertDistributedTraceHeaders with an empty object, the appropriate Distributed Trace headers and W3C Trace Context headers will be generated for the transaction. // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // This could be a header object from an incoming request as well const headersObject = {} newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // generate the headers transaction.insertDistributedTraceHeaders(headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders(transportType, headers) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call insertDistributedTraceHeaders, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting a payload generated by insertDistributedTraceHeaders or generated by some other W3C Trace Context compliant tracer. This method accepts the headers of an incoming request, looks for W3C Trace Context headers, and if not found, falls back to New Relic distributed trace headers. This method replaces the deprecated (and now removed as of version 7.0.0) acceptDistributedTracePayload method, which only handles New Relic distributed trace payloads. transportType should be one of the following strings: AMQP HTTP HTTPS IronMQ JMS Kafka Other Queue Unknown headers should be an object containing all the headers in the incoming request. The keys must be lowercase. Accept incoming distributed trace headers The following example demonstrates adding distributed trace headers retrieved from a Kafka message. In this example, we assume that the incoming Kafka message has Distributed Trace headers inserted. // incoming Kafka message headers const headersObject = message.headers // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. const transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { const transaction = newrelic.getTransaction() // accept the headers transaction.acceptDistributedTraceHeaders('Kafka', headersObject) }) Copy transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use insertDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For instructions on how to use this call, along with its partner call acceptDistributedTracePayload, see Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. This call is used to implement distributed tracing. It generates a payload that is read by the receiving application with acceptDistributedTracePayload. Important Note: In order to maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, you must generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it. The DistributedTracePayload object has two available methods used for generating the payload in different formats: DistributedTracePayload#text: returns a JSON representation of the payload. Link a nested background transaction // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() var jsonPayload = payload.text() newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction('background task', function executeTransaction() { var backgroundHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() // Link the nested transaction by accepting the payload with the background transaction's handle backgroundHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(jsonPayload) }) Copy DistributedTracePayload#httpSafe: returns a base64 encoded JSON representation of the payload. Place payload on an outgoing request // Call newrelic.getTransaction to retrieve a handle on the current transaction. var transactionHandle = newrelic.getTransaction() var payload = transactionHandle.createDistributedTracePayload() // Place the base64 encoded value on an outbound request header. req.headers[myTracingHeader] = payload.httpSafe() Copy transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload(payload) Copy Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0! Please use acceptDistributedTraceHeaders. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled. For context on how to use this call and its partner call createDistributedTracePayload, first read Enable distributed tracing with agent APIs. transactionHandle.acceptDistributedTracePayload is used to instrument the called service for inclusion in a distributed trace. It links the spans in a trace by accepting the payload generated by createDistributedTracePayload. transactionHandle.isSampled() transactionHandle.isSampled() Copy Returns whether this trace is being sampled. Other API calls New Relic's Node.js agent includes additional API calls. newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom attribute value to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in APM's transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Add custom attribute newrelic.addCustomAttribute('attribute1', 'value1') Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of a transaction so it has a place to set the custom attributes. Custom attributes will appear in the transaction trace detail view and in errors for the transaction. Adding custom attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 2 } newrelic.addCustomAttributes(attributes) Copy Caution If you want to use your custom attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute(name, value) Copy Set a custom span attribute value to be displayed along with a transaction trace span in the New Relic UI. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attribute newrelic.addCustomSpanAttribute('attribute1', 'value') Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Set multiple custom span attribute values to be displayed along with the transaction trace spans in the New Relic UI. The attributes should be passed as a single object. This must be called within the context of an active segment/span so it has a place to set the custom span attributes. Custom span attributes will appear in the Attributes section of the span detail view. Add custom span attributes const attributes = { attribute1: 'value1', attribute2: 'value2' } newrelic.addCustomSpanAttributes(attributes) Copy Important This API requires distributed tracing and span events to be enabled. Caution If you want to use your custom span attributes, avoid using any of the reserved terms used by NRQL when naming them. newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() newrelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() Copy Returns the HTML snippet to be inserted into the header of HTML pages to enable browser monitoring. The HTML will instruct the browser to fetch a small JavaScript file and start the page timer. newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) newrelic.setIgnoreTransaction(ignored) Copy Tell the module whether or not to ignore a given request. This allows you to explicitly filter long-polling, irrelevant routes or requests you know will be time-consuming. This also allows you to gather metrics for requests that otherwise would be ignored. To ignore the transaction, set the parameter to true will ignore the transaction. To prevent a transaction from being ignored with this function, pass the parameter false. Passing null or undefined will not change whether the transaction is ignored. Caution This method is deprecated and was removed in version 7.0.0. Please use transactionHandle.ignore() newrelic.noticeError(error, \\[customParameters]) newrelic.noticeError(error, \\[customParameters]) Copy Use this call if your app is doing its own error handling with domains or try/catch clauses, but you want all of the information about how many errors are coming out of the app to be centrally managed. Unlike other Node.js calls, this can be used outside of route handlers, but it will have additional context if called from within transaction scope. Caution Errors recorded using this method do not obey the ignore_status_codes configuration value. newrelic.shutdown(\\[options], callback) newrelic.shutdown(\\[options], callback) Copy Use this method to gracefully shut down the agent. options options.collectPendingData - type boolean - Tell the agent whether to send any pending data to the New Relic collector before shutting down. options.timeout - type number (ms) - The default time before forcing a shutdown. When collectPendingData is true, the agent will wait for a connection before shutting down. This timeout is useful for short lived processes, like AWS Lambda, in order to keep the process from staying open too long, while trying to connect. Example: newrelic.shutdown({collectPendingData: true, timeout: 3000}, (error) => { process.exit() }) Copy newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() newrelic.getLinkingMetadata() Copy Returns key/value pairs which can be used to link traces or entities. It will only contain items with meaningful values. For instance, if distributed tracing is disabled, trace.id will not be included. newrelic.getTraceMetadata() newrelic.getTraceMetadata() Copy Returns and object containing the current trace ID and span ID. Important This API requires distributed tracing to be enabled or an empty object will be returned. Rules for naming and ignoring requests If you do not want to put calls to the New Relic module directly into your application code, you can use pattern-based rules to name requests. There are two sets of rules: one for renaming requests, and one to mark requests to be ignored by New Relic's instrumentation. Here is the structure for rules in New Relic's Node.js agent. rules.name A list of rules of the format {pattern : \"pattern\", name : \"name\"} for matching incoming request URLs to pattern and naming the matching New Relic transaction's name. This acts as a regex replace, where you can set the pattern either as a string, or as a JavaScript regular expression literal, and both pattern and name are required. When passing a regex as a string, escape backslashes, as the agent does not keep them when given as a string in a pattern. Define your configuration rules from the most specific to the most general, as the patterns will be evaluated in order and are terminal in nature. For more information, see the naming guidelines. This can also be set with the environment variable NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited JSON object literals: NEW_RELIC_NAMING_RULES='{\"pattern\":\"^t\",\"name\":\"u\"},{\"pattern\":\"^u\",\"name\":\"t\"}' Copy Optional rules attributes [#optional-rules] Additional optional attributes are available: Optional rules attributes Description terminate_chain Default: true When set to true (default), no further rules will be evaluated if this rule is a match. Setting this to false is useful when multiple rules should be used together. For example, one rule could be replacing a common pattern in many different URLs, while subsequent rule(s) would be more specific. replace_all Default: false When set to true, all matches of the pattern will be replaced. Otherwise, only the first match will be replaced. Using the g flag with regular expression literal will have the same effect. For example: pattern: '[0-9]+', replace_all: true Copy This has the same effect as pattern: /[0-9]+/g. precedence By default the rules are evaluated in order, from first to last. If you prefer to have complete control over the order, you can give each rule a precedence attribute. The precedence is an integer number, and rules are evaluated in ascending order. If precedence is not explicitly defined, it will be set to 500 by default. Additional attributes are ignored. Testing your naming rules [#testing-rules] The Node.js agent comes with a command-line tool for testing naming rules. For more information, run the following command in terminal window in a directory where your app is installed: node node_modules/.bin/newrelic-naming-rules Copy Naming rule examples [#examples-rules] Here are some examples of naming rules and the results. Match full URL pattern: \"^/items/[0-9]+$\", name: \"/items/:id\" Copy will result in: /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123 => /orders/123 (not replaced since the rule is a full match) Copy Replace first match in URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\" Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/123 Copy Replace all matches in any URL pattern: \"[0-9]+\", name: \":id\", replace_all: true Copy will result in: /orders/123/items/123 => /orders/:id/items/:id Copy Match group references Using regular expression match group references: pattern: '^/(items|orders)/[0-9]+$', name: '/\\\\1/:id' Copy will result in: /orders/123 => /orders/:id /items/123 => /items/:id Copy rules.ignore This can also be set via the environment variable NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES, with multiple rules passed in as a list of comma-delimited patterns. Currently there is no way to escape commas in patterns. NEW_RELIC_IGNORING_RULES='^/socket\\.io/\\*/xhr-polling,ignore_me' Copy Here are full examples of how rules are included in the configuration file: Naming rule example // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { name : [ { pattern: \"/tables/name-here\", name: \"/name-hererule1\" } ] } Copy Ignoring rule example If you are using socket.io, you will have a use case for ignoring rules right out of the box. To keep socket.io long-polling from dominating your response-time metrics and affecting the Apdex metrics for your application, add a rule such as: // newrelic.js exports.config = { // other configuration rules : { ignore : [ '^\\/socket\\.io\\/.*\\/xhr-polling' ] } }; Copy API calls for rules Here are the API calls for naming and ignoring rules with New Relic's Node.js agent. newrelic.addNamingRule(pattern, name) Programmatic version of rules.name. Once naming rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. Both parameters are required. newrelic.addIgnoringRule(pattern) Programmatic version of rules.ignore. Once ignoring rules are added, they cannot be removed until the Node process is restarted. They can also be added via the Node.js agent's configuration. This parameter is required.",

      "body": "If you are having problems using the Java agent API for async tokens and segments, use these techniques to help you find answers and solve problems. Verify your instrumentation The API has a number of built-in safety mechanisms to prevent issues caused by incorrect API usage, but you can use these techniques to verify that your application’s instrumentation is correct: After instrumenting your code, verify that the logs show that an equal number of tokens have been created and expired. For more information on which log messages to look for, see Use logs to troubleshoot. Check the garbage collection statistics under APM's JVMs page to determine whether or not your changes have significantly altered garbage collection patterns. Check if any segments or tokens are timing out by reviewing your transaction traces for a timed_out attribute. If so, you can change the limit with token_timeout and segment_timeout. Use logs to troubleshoot To customize your Java agent logging, see Generating logs. Then, you can examine your logs for these common messages: To view created tokens, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@5a7cc8e: created active token com.newrelic.agent.TokenImpl@7db8d0e8 Copy To view expired tokens and the time that they expired, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@5a7cc8e: expired token com.newrelic.agent.TokenImpl@7db8d0e8 Copy To view created segments, check logs at FINEST for: Transaction com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@486b7f04: startSegment(): com.newrelic.agent.Segment@2b7fdad3 created and started with tracer com.newrelic.agent.tracers.OtherRootTracer@4df4a953 Copy To view ended segments and the time that they ended, check logs at FINEST for: com.newrelic.agent.Transaction@486b7f04--finish segment(): com.newrelic.agent.Segment@2b7fdad3 async finish with tracer com.newrelic.agent.tracers.OtherRootTracer@4df4a953 Copy Problem: Transaction times are too long Make sure to expire tokens and end or ignore segments; otherwise transactions may take longer to report to New Relic. The Java agent has a timeout mechanism for tokens and segments that are not ended correctly. For more information, see token_timeout and segment_timeout. Problem: No transaction trace data Inspect transaction traces to make sure expected asynchronous work is reported. If you do not see any transaction traces, make sure your transaction duration exceeds the transaction trace threshold set in transaction_threshold. Problem: Too few async calls If too few calls are being reported: Ensure that each activity you monitor is appropriately linked In the faulty example below, a parallel stream is being used, which means that the work done inside the lambda in the call to map() can be scheduled on a different thread than the thread handling the request. Without creating a token to link all this work together, you will not see any of the work that gets scheduled on a different thread inside of your transaction. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_bad\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamBad(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(i -> requestItem(i)) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_bad\", results); } Copy Check if you are missing required annotations The example below will report only a subset of the calls to requestItem() because it is impossible to put @Trace(async = true) around blocks of anonymous work inside the call to map(). Instead, you should pass the token into requestItem() and link it, and then add @Trace(async=true) around it. Or use a helper function like requestItemAsync() to do this without changing your existing methods. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_bad2\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamBad2(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken(); List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> { token.link(); return requestItem(id); }) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_bad2\", results); } Copy Compare this to the correct example below, in which the lambda expression is wrapped by the wrapper class InstrumentedCallable. This class accepts a token and a lambda, then wraps asynchronous work in @Trace(async = true) and uses a token to link the work to the request thread. @RequestMapping(\"parallel_stream_wrap\") @Trace(dispatcher = true) public ResponseEntity parallelStreamWrap(@RequestParam(\"ids\") List<long> ids) { final Token token = NewRelic.getAgent().getTransaction().getToken(); List<item> results = ids .parallelStream() .map(id -> InstrumentedCallable.instrumentCallable(token, () -> requestItem(id))) .map(c -> c.call()) .filter(item -> item != null) .collect(Collectors.toList()); token.expire(); return formattedResponse(\"parallel_stream_wrap\", results); } Copy",

      "body": "Attributes are key-value pairs containing information that determines the properties of an event or transaction. You can view these key-value pairs in some places in the UI, or by querying that data using NRQL. New Relic gives users the ability to customize exactly which attributes will be sent to each of these destinations. You can also collect custom attributes to send additional data to New Relic. Attribute destination flow This diagram illustrates how an agent decides to send attributes to each destination. Agent attribute collection: An agent makes three different decisions when sending an attribute to any New Relic destination based on the relevant property settings. Property names and syntax vary by agent. (The properties in this diagram are specific to the PHP agent, but the general flow is the same for all agents. Property names and syntax vary by agent.) Types of attributes Attributes can be collected in a variety of ways: Message property attributes: These are the properties set on a message received from a queue or topic. HTTP request attributes: These are the parameters for an HTTP request. User attributes: These are attributes provided by the user through each agent's API. Agent attributes: These are attributes captured by the agent; for example, httpResponseCode and httpResponseMessage. Destinations for attributes Collected attributes appear in these locations: Collected attributes Location Transaction traces Each minute transaction traces collect data for your slowest individual HTTP requests. These traces will report attributes collected during the transaction. Traced errors If a transaction results in an error, these traced errors will be reported to APM. A traced error will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Transaction events APM transactions will contain attributes collected during the transaction. Insights page views Browser page views will contain attributes collected during the transaction. However, attributes collected at the end of a transaction may not appear on PageView events. This destination is also called browser monitoring. Span events Span events collected for distributed tracing will contain attributes collected during the span. The following agents support the addition of custom user attributes to span events: Java agent 5.13.0 and above Go agent 3.6.0 and above .NET agent 8.25 and above Node agent 6.10.0 and above PHP agent 9.12.0.268 and above Python agent 5.8.0.136 and above Ruby agent 6.8.0 and above Transaction segments Each segment in a transaction trace will contain attributes recorded for that segment. Viewing request attributes Request attributes are associated with specific transaction traces, browser traces, and errors in APM and dashboards. You can see the attributes recorded with a request when viewing the individual trace or error. Custom attributes can be queried via NRQL exactly like any other attribute. APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Transactions > (select a transaction) > (select a trace): Here is an example from the Ruby agent of the Request attributes and Custom attributes for a transaction trace. Exact attributes depend on your agent and on your attribute configuration. Limits User attributes, request attributes, and message queue parameters are limited by count and size. Parameter Limitations Transaction Limited to 64 user attributes Attribute key Limited to 256 bytes each If the key is more than 256 bytes, then the attribute will not be recorded. Attribute value Limited to 256 bytes each If the value is greater than 256 bytes, then the attribute value will be truncated. Agent-specific attributes Each APM agent collects custom attributes. The supported attributes depend on the specific agent: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby",

Example configuration: <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>foo</include> <include>myCustomAtt</include> <exclude>password</exclude> <exclude>myCustomAtt</exclude> </attributes> Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo, myCustomAtt, password Keys included: foo Keys excluded: password, myCustomAtt Copy Keys are case sensitive. Keys are case sensitive. Example configuration: <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>password</exclude> <exclude>PaSsWoRd</exclude> </attributes> Copy Example output: Keys passed in: password, Password, PASSWORD, PaSsWoRd, PassWORD Keys included: Password, PASSWORD, PassWORD Keys excluded: password, PaSsWoRd Copy Use an asterisk * for wildcards. You can use an asterisk * at the end of a key as a wildcard. This will match all attributes with the same prefix. Example configuration: <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>custom*</include> <exclude>request.parameters.*</exclude> </attributes> Copy Example output: Keys passed in: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2, request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: custom, custom.key1, custom.key2 Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Copy Most specific setting for a key takes priority. If multiple include or exclude attributes affect the same key, the most specific setting will have priority. Example configuration: <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>request.parameters.foo</include> <exclude>request.parameters.*</exclude> </attributes> Copy Example output: Keys passed in: request.parameters., request.parameters.foo, request.parameters.bar Keys included: request.parameters.foo Keys excluded: request.parameters., request.parameters.bar Copy Include or exclude affects the specific destination. If the attribute include or exclude is specified on a destination, then it only impacts that destination. Example configuration: <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>foo</include> </attributes> <transactionEvents enabled=\"true\"> <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <exclude>foo</exclude> </attributes> </transactionEvents> Copy Example output: Keys passed in: foo Keys included for transaction events: Keys included for other destinations: foo Keys excluded for transaction events: foo Copy Obsolete properties The following properties are not available in the .NET agent v9.0. Please visit the .NET agent 8.x to 9.x migration guide page for replacement properties when upgrading your .NET agent. analyticsEvents replaced by transactionEvents The analyticsEvents element in newrelic.config is obsolete. Enable the transactionEvents element in newrelic.config: <transactionEvents enabled=\"true\"/> Copy requestParameters replaced by request.parameters.* By default, request parameters are not sent to New Relic. Add request.parameters.* to the attributes.include list to enable request parameter collection. <attributes> <include>request.parameters.*</include> </attributes> Copy parameterGroups: enable and ignore replaced by attributes true, include and exclude The parameterGroups value and its enabled and ignore settings are obsolete. By default, customParameters and responseHeaderParameters are instrumented, while serviceRequestParameters are not instrumented. To customize these settings: Use the enabled flag to enable instrumentation. Use include and exclude to toggle instrumentation for specific attributes. For example: <attributes enabled=\"true\"> <include>service.request.*</include> <exclude>response.headers.*</exclude> <exclude>myCustomApiKey.*</exclude> </attributes> Copy For more information on configuring attributes, see the attributes examples. captureAttributes flag replaced by attributes sub-elements The capture attributes flag on browserMonitoring, transactionTracer, transactionEvents, and errorCollector is obsolete. Instead, use the attributes sub-element to configure attribute settings for each of these destinations. New property Example browserMonitoring <browserMonitoring enabled=\"true\"> <attributes enabled=\"false\"> <include>myKey.*</include> <exclude>myKey.foo</exclude> </attributes> </browserMonitoring> Copy transactionTracer <transactionTracer enabled=\"true\"> <attributes enabled=\"false\"> <include>myKey.*</include> <exclude>myKey.foo</exclude> </attributes> </transactionTracer> Copy transactionEvents <transactionEvents enabled=\"true\"> <attributes enabled=\"false\"> <include>myKey.*</include> <exclude>myKey.foo</exclude> </attributes> </transactionEvents> Copy errorCollector <errorCollector enabled=\"true\"> <attributes enabled=\"false\"> <include>myKey.*</include> <exclude>myKey.foo</exclude> </attributes> </errorCollector>> Copy",
