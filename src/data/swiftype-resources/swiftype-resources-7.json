Tip To use our APIs, or the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is our preferred API for querying New Relic data, and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

Tip To use our APIs, or the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is our preferred API for querying New Relic data, and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

Tip To use our APIs, or the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is our preferred API for querying New Relic data, and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

Tip To use our APIs, or the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is our preferred API for querying New Relic data, and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

Tip To use our APIs, or the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is our preferred API for querying New Relic data, and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

NerdGraph is our preferred API for querying New Relic data, and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs.

      "body": "Our Incident Intelligence uses logic to correlate your incidents. We call these logic \"decisions.\" We have built-in decisions and you can create and customize your own on the Incident Intelligence Decisions UI page. The more optimally you configure decisions, the better we will group and correlate your incident events, resulting in reduced noise and increased context for on-call teams. one.newrelic.com > Applied Intelligence > Incident intelligence > Decisions: Our UI shows how each decision correlates incidents. Key concepts Here are some key concepts for understanding our decisions logic: What is \"correlation\" and how does it work? For the incident events being sent into Incident Intelligence from your various alerting engines, the most recently created and active incidents are available for correlation. Correlation occurs between two events whenever the criteria in any decision is met. All the events available for correlation are tested against each other in all possible pair combinations and a \"greedy merge\" is performed. This means that if incident A correlates with B into an issue and incident B correlates with incident C into another issue, then AB and BC will also merge together resulting in a single issue including A, B, and C. What types of logic can be used in a decision? At a high level, decisions allow you to define logic based on time (duration between events), frequency (number of events), context (metadata structure & values), and topology (entity relationships). Review your active decisions Decisions determine how Incident Intelligence correlates incidents together. By default, a broad set of global decisions is enabled when you start using Incident Intelligence. To review existing decisions: Go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. In the left navigation, under Incident Intelligence, click Decisions. Review the list of active decisions. To see the rule logic that creates correlations between your issues, click the decision. To see examples of incidents the decision correlated, click the Recent correlations tab. Use any of the other options to enable or disable these global decisions. Your decisions will routinely be analyzed for their efficacy as well as other best practices, and recommendations will be attached for review. Correlation statistics Whether you want to use the suggested decisions we provide using our pattern recognition algorithms, or you want to add in your own correlation logic, you'll get insights into your correlation rate, flapping effectiveness, noise reduction improvement, and the number of correlated issues arising, as shown below. From the UI, you can view the underlying NRQL queries and create your own custom charts and dashboards from this data. one.newrelic.com > Applied Intelligence > Incident intelligence > Decisions: Some example statistics from the decisions UI. Some definitions of statistics: Correlation rate: The percentage of the time correlations are occurring versus not. Total correlated issues: Number of issues correlated with another issue. Noise reduction: Total number of issues after correlation divided by the total number of issues before correlation. Flapping effectiveness: The percentage of issues where flapping was detected (opening and closing frequently) and new redundant issues were prevented from opening. Correlation reason: Shows which decisions are correlating issues the most. Use suggested decisions Information about the types of suggested decisions: Suggested decisions: The data from your selected sources is continuously inspected for patterns to help reduce noise. Once patterns have been observed in your data, decisions are suggested that would allow these events to correlate in the future. Accelerated suggested decisions: If you have been using New Relic Alerts for a while, when you add alert policies to sources, we're able to use that historical data to accelerate the pattern recognition step and suggest decisions up to 30% faster. To get started, click on a suggested decision, located under the statistics block on the Decisions UI page. You'll see information on the logic behind the suggested decision, why we think it will help you, and the estimated correlation rate for that decision. one.newrelic.com > Applied Intelligence > Incident intelligence > Decisions: Suggested decision block If there isn't enough data to see the correlation rate, a link right below the percentage estimate will guide you to other sources you can add to get stronger results. Note: if you have less than 5000 incidents per month, you probably won't have suggested decisions. To add the suggested decision, click Activate decision and it will appear enabled, alongside the other decisions. If the decision isn't relevant to your needs, click Dismiss. Create custom decisions You can reduce noise and improve correlation by building your own custom decisions. To start building a decision, go to one.newrelic.com and click Alerts & AI. In the left navigation, under Incident Intelligence, click Decisions, then click Add a decision. Tips on how to use that UI are in the table below. When building a decision, steps 1, 2 and 3 are optional on their own but at least one must be defined in order to create a decision. Option Description Step 1: Filter your data In this step you'll define your filters. Remember correlation occurs between two incidents. If no filters are defined all incoming Incidents will be considered by the decision. Define your filters for the first segment (or bucket) of incidents, and the second segment of Incidents. Types of filter operators range from substring matching to regex matching to help you target the incident events you want and exclude those you don't. All combination of event pairs between segment one and segment two are used in the next steps of the decision. Step 2: Contextual correlation Once you've filtered your data, define the logic used when comparing the incidents' context. You can correlate events based on the following methods: Attribute value comparisons with standard operators Attribute value similarity using similarity algorithms Attribute value regex with capture groups Entire incident comparisons using similarity or clustering algorithms Step 3: Topology correlation Topology correlation is currently in limited release. Contact your account representative to enable this feature. Once enabled, you'll first need to ingest your topology data via our NerdGraph aiTopologyCollector (search for aiTopology in the NerdGraph explorer). This allows any topology-related decision to be matched with your topology data. Learn more about setting up topology correlation. Give it a name After you configure your decision logic, give it a recognizable name and description. This is used in notifications and other areas of the UI to indicate which decision caused a pair of incidents to be correlated together. Advanced settings Optional. The advanced settings area allows you to further customize how your decision behaves when correlating events. Each setting has a default value so customization is optional. Time window: Sets the maximum time between two incidents created time for them to be eligible for correlation. Issue priority: Overrides the default priority setting (inherit priority) to add higher or lower priority if the Incidents are correlated. Frequency: Modifies the minimum number of incidents that need to meet the rule logic for the decision to trigger. Similarity: If you're using similar to operators in your rule logic, you can choose from a list of algorithms and set its sensitivity. This will apply to all similar to operators in your decision. Similarity algorithms Here are technical details on the similarity algorithms we use: Levenshtein distance This measure is useful for comparing short strings with static schema and fixed length, like host names. Levenshtein distance is also known as edit distance. Details Description How it works The Levenshtein distance between two strings is the minimum number of single-character edits to get from one string to the other. Allowed edit operations are deletion, insertion, and substitution. The default similarity threshold for Applied Intelligence decisions is an edit distance of 3. You can change this in the Advanced mode of the decision builder. When to use it This measure is most useful for comparing relatively short strings with static schema and fixed length. Common applications include spell checkers, computational biology, and speech recognition. Examples number/bumble: 3 (number → bumber → bumblr → bumble) trying/lying: 2 (trying → rying → lying) strong/through: 4 (strong → htrong → throng → throug → through) Potential drawbacks Levenshtein distance is not normalized by default to take into account string lengths. Fuzzy score This metric is useful for comparing same-length strings where the same prefix would be a good indicator of correlation. Details Description How it works The fuzzy score algorithm works by allocating \"points\" for character matches between strings: One point for each matching character Two bonus points for subsequent matches The higher the fuzzy score, the greater the similarity between two strings. When to use it Fuzzy score is most useful for strings that have the same, and relatively short (ideally < 5 character), prefixes. A minimum guaranteed score would be (length(expected prefix) * 3) - 2. Examples Example: Decisions / dcsions d: 1 c: 1 i 1 s: 2 o: 1 n: 1 si: 2 io: 2 on: 2 ns: 2 = 15 points Potential drawbacks If the first character of the first string can't be found in the second string, no points are awarded. Fuzzy wuzzy ratio This metric is useful for comparing strings of similar length. Details Description How it works The fuzzy wuzzy family of similarity measures was developed by SeatGeek to help find tickets for the same event that have different labels across multiple platforms. The fuzzy wuzzy ratio for two strings is expressed as a percentage, where a higher number indicates a more similar string. It's based on the SequenceMatcher algorithm in Python's difflib. When to use it Fuzzy wuzzy ratio is effective for very short (eg. hostname) or very long (eg. event description) strings, especially in comparing strings of similar length. Potential drawbacks This algorithm is too sensitive to be used effectively for 3-10 word strings. One of the other modifications to fuzzy wuzzy (see below) may be a better choice. Fuzzy wuzzy partial ratio This metric is useful for comparing strings of different length. This modification to the fuzzy wuzzy algorithm helps address the effective length limitation. Details Description How it works With fuzzy wuzzy partial ratio, the shorter string is compared to each substring of the same length within the longer string. The score of the “best matching” substring is used to determine the fuzzy wuzzy partial ratio. When to use it Fuzzy wuzzy partial ratio is especially effective for the types of comparisons the basic fuzzy wuzzy algorithm fails at: 3-10 word strings where some significant substrings are likely to be overlapping. Examples For example, between the following strings: DevOps and SRE teams DevOps …”DevOps” (the shorter string, length = 6) would be compared to each substring with length 6 within “DevOps and SRE teams.” Since one of those substrings (“DevOps”) is a perfect match, the fuzzy wuzzy partial ratio for these two strings will be high. Potential drawbacks Where fuzzy wuzzy may be too conservative, fuzzy wuzzy partial match may be more liberal than expected with correlations. You can adjust the threshold in the decision builder according to your needs. Fuzzy wuzzy token set ratio This metric is useful for comparing strings where the information may not be in the same order, and of possible different lengths. It works best for sentences such as messages, descriptions, etc. Details Description How it works The token set ratio algorithm follows a few steps to compare strings: Tokenize each string (eg. “DevOps and SRE teams” → “DevOps” “and” “SRE” “teams”; “SRE team and DevOps engineers” → “SRE” “teams” “and” “DevOps” “engineers”) Combine intersecting tokens into a new string, leaving the remaining tokens. (eg. intersecting: ”DevOps”, “and”, “SRE”; remainder1: “teams”; remainder2: “team”, “engineers”) Alphabetize each token group (eg. “and, DevOps, SRE”, “teams”, engineers, team”) Compare the following pairs of strings: Intersection group Intersection group + remainder1 Intersection group + remainder2 The comparison from these pairs (“best matches”) is the fuzzy wuzzy token set ratio. When to use it This metric is helpful in cases where similar strings may have overlapping words but different construction - for example, event descriptions for different issues with the same resource. Potential drawbacks Where fuzzy wuzzy may be too conservative, fuzzy wuzzy token set match may be more liberal than expected with correlations. You can adjust the threshold in the decision builder according to your needs. Jaro-winkler distance This metric is useful for short strings where identical prefixes are a strong indication of correlation. Details Description How it works This metric uses a scale of 0-1 to indicate the similarity between two strings, where 0 is no similarity (0 matching characters between strings) and 1 is an exact match. Jaro-Winkler similarity takes into account: matching: two characters that are the same and in similar positions in the strings. transpositions: matching characters that are in different sequence order in the strings. prefix scale: the Jaro-Winkler distance is adjusted favorably if strings match from the beginning (a prefix is up to 4 characters). When to use it This metric is fairly tolerant of transpositions, but transpositions further apart in the string are less useful. A generally-safe number to use for Jaro-Winkler similarity in moderate to long strings is 0.9; you could use ~ 0.85 in cases where more leniency is okay (if you have other, more specific logic in the decision). Cosine distance This measure is most commonly used to compare large blocks of text (for example, incident descriptions) and provides an easy visualization of similarity. Details Description How it works For each text block you're comparing, a vector is calculated to represent the count of each unique word in the block. The cosine distance of the resulting vectors is their dot product divided by the product of their magnitudes. When to use it This measure is most useful to compare long blocks of text, specifically when the comparison is meant to consider the text as a whole, and not differences or misspellings in individual words. Examples It is not length of life, but depth of life. Depth of life does not depend on length. Copy Here are the word counts for these sentences: it 1 0 is 0 1 not 1 1 length 1 1 of 2 1 life 2 1 but 1 0 depth 1 1 does 0 1 depend 0 1 on 0 1 And here are those counts represented as a vector: [1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0] [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1] Copy The cosine distance of these vectors is about 0.9 (1 is the highest similarity). Potential drawbacks Cosine distance is less useful for situations where small character differences in words are insignificant. Also, cosine distance ignores word order in the text blocks. For more information on cosine distance implementation, see this detailed walkthrough. Hamming distance This measure is useful for shorter text with static schema, but it works only for same-length strings. Details Description When to use it Hamming distance requires the compared strings to be of equal length. This is a useful similarity metric for situations where the difference between two strings may be due to typos, or where you want to compare two attributes with known lengths. For example: Low Disk Space in application myapp in datacenter us01 If you wanted to be tolerant to datacenter changes, the hamming distance should be set to 4. An average use case for Hamming distance would be around 2-3. Examples A simpler version of \"edit distance\" metrics like Levenshtein distance, the Hamming distance between two strings is the number of characters in the string that don't match (in the same position). For example, in the strings below, the Hamming distance is 2: flowers / florets Copy Potential drawbacks In the example above, if the application name changes instead of the datacenter, a correlation would also be created. As the distance grows, the usefulness of Hamming Distance plummets. For this reason, for anything remotely more complicated than being tolerant to 1-2 character substitutions (or if the string lengths will not match), a different similarity measurement should be used. Jaccard distance This measure is useful for comparing large blocks of text, like descriptions or entire incidents. Details Description How it works The distance, denoted as a percentage (0 being completely similar; 1 being totally dissimilar) is calculated with the following formula: 1 - [(# of characters in both sets) / (# of characters in either set) * 100] Copy In other words, the Jaccard distance is the number of shared characters divided by the total number of characters (shared and un-shared). A Jaccard distance of 0.1 means that 10% or fewer characters between two incidents are different. When to use it Jaccard distance is very easy to interpret and especially useful in cases with large data sets. For example, in comparing the similarity between two entire incidents (as opposed to one attribute). Potential drawbacks It's less effective for small data sets or situations with missing data. Also, different permutations of the character set don't affect Jaccard distance, so care should be taken to prevent false positives. Regex operators When building a decision, available operators include: contains (regex): used in Step 1: Filter your data. regular expression match: used in Step 2: Contextual correlation. The decision builder follows the standards outlined in these documents for regular expressions. Regex in Step 1 In order for your regex to test as true, the entire attribute value (the data you’re evaluating) must be matched by the regular expression provided. Captured groups can be used but are not explicitly evaluated. For instance, if the attribute value is foobarbaz, these examples would meet the criteria and test as true: foo.* ^.*baz \\w+ Regex in Step 2 In order for your regex to test as true, the entire attribute values for incident 1 and incident 2 must be included in the match. Also, each captured group (expressions in ( ) parentheses) must exist in both values (incident 1 and incident 2 attributes), and have the same value: The number of captured groups must be equal for both incident attributes. Each group must be equal to the corresponding group between attribute values: the value of the first captured group in the incident 1 attribute value is equal to the value of the first captured group in the incident 2 attribute. For instance, if attribute value 1 is abc-123-xyz and attribute value 2 is abc-777-xyz, then (\\w+)-(?:\\w+)-(\\w+) would meet the criteria: The whole value is matched by the expression. The first and third captured groups have the same respective values. The second group is not captured using ?:, which allows the whole value to match but isn’t used in the capture group comparison. About flags No flags are enabled by default. Some useful flags to include in regular expressions in the decision builder are: CASE_INSENSITIVE: (?i) MULTILINE: (?m) DOTALL: (?s) See field detail for more notes on the function and implementation of each of these flags. Correlation assistant You can use the correlation assistant to more quickly analyze incidents, create decision logic, and test the logic with a simulation. To use the correlation assistant: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI, click Overview, then click the Incidents tab. Check the boxes of incidents you'd like to correlate. Then, at the bottom of the incident list, click Correlate incidents. For best results for correlating incidents, select common attributes with a low frequency percentage. Learn more about using frequency. Click Simulate to see the likely effect of your new decision on the last week of your data. Click on examples of correlation pairs and determine of those correlations are desired. If you like what's been simulated, click Next, and then name and describe your decision. If the simulation result shows too many potential incidents, you may want to choose a different set of attributes and incidents for your decision and run another simulation. Learn more about simulation. Attribute analysis Here are explanations of the two types of attribute analysis displayed in the UI: Common attributes: This analysis simply highlights attributes and values that are the exact same between all selected incidents. Similar attributes: Similarity analysis uses the Levenshtein algorithm with a distance of 3 to find attributes whose values would be the same if 3 or less character changes are performed. Other details: Numerical values as well as single character values are filtered out of the results. Requires two incidents to be selected. Similarity analysis is not performed when 3 or more incidents are selected. To create the best decisions, we recommend choosing common attributes that have a lower frequency in your incidents. Here are tips for understanding how choosing low or high frequency attributes affects your decisions: Low frequency: As an example, an attribute with a 0% in the frequency column is likely a unique identifier or an attribute that only recently reported in your data in the last month. Choosing low frequency attributes may correlate few events. High frequency: On the other end, an attribute with 100% frequency would be one that is present on all your data. Choosing these attributes would correlate all of your events together. By default, the attributes are sorted by frequency with the least frequently reported attributes at the top. Click an attribute's frequency percentage to get more information about the distribution of values we've seen reported for that attribute in the last month. Tips on using simulation Using a set of incidents, the correlation assistant identifies common attributes among those incidents as well as attributes with similar values. Select attributes you believe are good indicators that events should correlate and then simulate the decision. Simulation will test the logic against the last week of your data and show you how many correlations would have happened, in addition to actual examples to inspect. If the simulation looks good, continue creating your real decision. If the simulation doesn't show examples of useful correlations, choose a different set of attributes, and run the simulation again. Here’s a breakdown of the decision preview information displayed when you create a simulation: Potential correlation rate: The percentage of tested incidents this decision would have affected. Total created incidents: The number of incidents tested by this decision. Total estimated correlated incidents: The estimated number of incidents this decision would have correlated. Incident examples: A list of incident pairs this decision would have correlated. You can click on these to see a side by side comparison of all attributes and values to help you determine if the correlation is desired or not. Run the simulation with different attributes as many times as you need until you see results you like. When you’re ready, follow the UI prompts to save your decision. Topology correlation What do we mean by “topology”? For New Relic's Applied Intelligence, topology is a representation of your service map: how the services and resources in your infrastructure relate to one another. When you create a custom decision, you can use our topology correlation, which finds relationships between incident sources to determine if incidents should correlate. Topology correlation is designed to improve the quality of your correlations and the speed at which they're found. Requirements Topology correlation is currently in limited release. Requirements: Given access to topology feature by a New Relic representative Limit of 10K vertices per New Relic organization per environment How does topology correlation work? In this service map, the hosts and apps are the vertices, and the lines showing their relationships are the edges. Topology correlation relies on two main concepts: Vertex: A vertex represents a monitored entity: it's the source from which your incident events are coming from, or describing a problematic symptom about. A vertex has attributes (key/value pairs) configured for it, like entity GUIDs or other IDs, which allow it be associated with incoming incident events. Edges: An edge is a connection between two vertices. Edges describe the relationship between vertices. To set up your topology, you'll use our NerdGraph API. But first, it may help to understand how topology is used to correlate incidents: First, New Relic gathers all relevant incidents. This includes incidents where decision-logic steps 1 and 2 are true, and that are also within the defined time window in advanced settings. In this example, all of the incidents in the dotted-line selection have met these requirements: they've gone through the decision logic in steps 1 and 2, and all contextual comparisons made in decision logic step 2 are true. Next, we attempt to associate each incident to a vertex in your topology graph using a vertex's defining attributes and the available attributes on the incident. Here's an example of the steps for associating incidents with the information in the topology graph. Next, the pairs of vertices which were associated with incidents are tested using the \"topologically dependent\" operator to determine if these vertices are connected to each other. This operator checks to see if there is any path in the graph that connect the two vertices within 5 hops. The incidents are then correlated and the issues are merged together. Add attributes to incident events Incidents are connected to vertices using a vertex's defining attributes (in the example topology under Topology explained, each vertex has a defining attribute \"CID\" with a unique value). Next, Applied Intelligence finds a vertex that matches the attribute. If the defining attribute you'd like to use on your vertices isn't already on your incident events there are a few ways to add it: Tag your entities in New Relic: By tagging your entities, those tags will enrich the incident events generated by Alerts. For example, if you've tagged your entities with CID and their corresponding unique values then you can have defining attributes on your vertex as follows: 'newrelic/tags/CID' : CID_VALUE Facet your data: Creating NRQL alert conditions with one or more facets defined will group your data by attribute. Also, incident events emitted will be enriched with those attributes and values. For incidents, faceted attributes follow the same format: newrelic/tags/ATTRIBUTE_NAME Create or view topology To set up your topology or view existing topology, see the NerdGraph topology tutorial.",

      "body": "In order to improve your New Relic experience we've made some big improvements to our platform. As a result, we'll be ending support for some old features over the next few weeks. Many have already been publicly announced as \"end-of-life.\" These changes represent our commitment to improve your interactions with our platform. Our mission is one observability platform that unites your telemetry data, connects your full stack, and helps you build more perfect software. To that end we're focusing on simplifying your experience for troubleshooting, alerting, and visualizing data. Here are more details on what's changed, with some helpful links and guides on how to take advantage of new capabilities to achieve the same goals. As always, we're here to help. Please connect with us in the Explorers Hub, or contact your account team with any questions. Old Kubernetes integration agent versions To improve our unified experience, starting from Wednesday, August 12, 2020, Kubernetes integrations that use v1.7 or older will be deprecated. The UI experience in the infrastructure.newrelic.com domain will no longer be available; it will only be available in New Relic One. If you are already using the latest Kubernetes agent version, no action is necessary. If you are using v1.7 or older, you must update your integration in order to continue viewing Kubernetes performance data. Follow the instructions in our documentation to upgrade to the latest version of the Kubernetes integration. Action items for a successful transition: Review the Kubernetes agent deprecation notice. Follow standard procedures to upgrade your Kubernetes agent to the latest version. Learn about the Kubernetes cluster explorer UI in New Relic One. For more information, see the Explorers Hub post. Monitor listing page and Synthetic labels To improve the experience of Synthetic monitors and labels, we've moved both experiences into the New Relic One platform. If you use the REST API for Synthetic label management, you must update to the tags API moving forward. The good news: with the NerdGraph tags API, you can organize and group all your entities in a single request. For more information about any of the following, see the Explorers Hub post. Action items for a successful transition: Synthetic monitors transition Comments Monitor index list When migration is completed, no action is needed on your part to use the new Synthetics entity listing pages. The new experience will be available to you automatically after July 20, 2020. For more information, learn how the explorer in New Relic One replaces the Synthetics monitors index. Existing Synthetics labels You may have already seen an option in the UI to migrate your Synthetics monitor labels to New Relic One tags. If you did not select that option, we've got you covered. Automatic migration from labels to tags starts begins July 8, 2020. For more information, learn how tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. REST API If you use the REST API for Synthetics label management, follow these steps to update to the tags API: Learn more about NerdGraph. Review the NerdGraph tagging API tutorial. Make sure you have a Personal API key to use NerdGraph. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post (look for the How do I transition my scripts from the Synthetics API to the tag API (NerdGraph)? section), and update your existing tags with the GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. NerdGraph is our GraphQL API, a query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph calls get all the data you need in a single request. NerdGraph also makes it easier to evolve APIs over time. \"Rollup by\" in Synthetics Synthetics is moving to New Relic One to provide a single platform for observability of your complex software systems. To do this we are unifying the tools you use to tag (or label) your services, applications, and monitors. The specific feature that is end-of-life is the Rollup by feature under the Search monitors dropdown menu. You can group monitors by tags in New Relic One without needing a separate Rollup by dropdown. No changes will be required to use the new Synthetic monitor listing pages. The new experiences will be available to you after July 20, 2020. Documentation: Tagging in New Relic One replaces labels for Synthetics monitors. Explorer in New Relic One replaces Synthetics monitors index. Action items for a successful transition: If you currently use Synthetics rollups: Follow the procedures in the Explorer Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Go to the Explorers Hub post about the rollups EOL. In particular, look for How can New Relic Workloads help me visualize groups of applications and monitors? in the post's FAQs section. Follow the procedures in the Explorers Hub post to recreate the rollups that are being retired. Embedded charts In order to reduce redundancy and provide a more unified experience, the embedded charts functionality will be replaced by the New Relic One Get chart. Embedded charts currently in use and hosted outside the New Relic domain will continue to function. The changes will include: The name on the chart's menu that generates them will change from Embed to Get chart link. For charts that are no longer supported, Embed will be replaced with Get chart link is not supported for this chart. The APM UI page that lists all embedded chart links will no longer be available. Documentation: Explorers Hub post New Relic One's enhanced chart builder functionality replaces the EOL embed chart functionality. Action items for a successful transition: You can generate a publicly accessible link to add to internal and external websites. Users do not need to be logged in to New Relic to see the chart link. The ability to embed a chart will remain, but instead of clicking Embed (which will be removed from the UI), you will click Get chart link (which is in the same location). This gives you the ability to get links with an even broader range of chart visuals and behaviors than the one we are retiring. Here's an example of how it looks in New Relic One: To replace existing chart links you created with Embed, create new URLs with New Relic One's Get chart link, and insert them in webpages where they're used. If you have an embedded chart and get the message Get chart link is not supported for this chart, simply run a different query, select an available chart type, and then select Embed. Legacy distributed tracing UI To standardize our user experience, we will be deprecating the older distributed tracing UI, which exists within the rpm.newrelic.com domain. You can access distributed tracing through New Relic One, which provides a superior experience with all the functionality supported in the duplicate UI that is end-of-life. Documentation: Global and service-specific distributed tracing views in New Relic One Deprecated distributed tracing UI Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. New Relic One's distributed tracing page builds on capabilities you are already familiar with. Get acquainted with the enhanced distributed tracing features in New Relic One, including search and filter capabilities with cross-account trace details, query options with the NerdGraph API, and histogram charts (which can help you quickly understand trace distribution for important values such as duration). Review the trace sampling options available with head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) and tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing). Violations changes In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Browser, Mobile, and Synthetics monitor violations and replacing them with the New Relic One equivalent. New Relic One users can access violations by using any of these options: Click the Alerts and AI link in New Relic One's main UI. Review the entity list activity stream. See alert details from inside a specific entity via the new indicator for Operational, Warning, and Critical violations. You will see alert details automatically when navigating to one.newrelic.com. Documentation: Applied Intelligence and alerting in New Relic One Browser alert violations (moving to New Relic One) Mobile violations (moving to New Relic One) Monitor violations (moving to New Relic One) Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience. Here's an example of the detailed information about an Alerts violation for a selected entity in New Relic One. Violation details in New Relic One Comments Holistic view From New Relic One's homepage, the entity list presents an activity stream of all entities with alert violations. You no longer need to jump around individual lists of end-user, mobile, or monitor violations. Enhanced troubleshooting tools From New Relic One's homepage, you will also see an Alerts & AI (Applied Intelligence) link. From here you can solve problems faster with anomaly detection, incident correlation, and noise reduction. Specific violation From a selected entity, you will see a new button identifying the violation as Operational, Warning, or Critical, as well as entity metadata and useful details about the incident. Connected agents page Finding your connected agents has never been easier! You can already do this via the Query your data link in New Relic One. Simply run these NrDailyUsage queries to get a list of connected agents and hosts. The old Connected agents page is end-of-life and will be removed. Documentation: Explorers Hub post NRQL query tools NrDailyUsage data definition Action items for a successful transition: To query your connected apps and hosts, you can use existing NRQL query tools, such as New Relic One's chart builder, the GraphQL API, or Insights. Recommendation: For best results exploring comprehensive data about your apps and hosts, use chart builder in New Relic One or the NerdGraph API. For best results with Insights, run separate queries for apps and hosts. Inactive apps in New Relic One Starting June 8, 2020, New Relic One will not continue to display any APM application that hasn't reported data for 93 days. To match our published APM data retention guidelines, applications that have not reported data will be available within the New Relic UI for 90 days. After 90 days, those applications will be removed from the UI. However, key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API based on subscription level. This is why the application name will remain reserved until the application is permanently deleted via the REST API Explorer. Action items for a successful transition: If you want to reuse an app name for an old app that is no longer reporting data: Use the REST API v2 or API Explorer to get summary data, including app ID, name, health status (look for gray), last reported, etc. Uninstall the agent for your app. Use the REST API or API Explorer to delete the apps. Synthetic monitor alert notifications and conditions In order to provide a unified experience, we're deprecating Synthetics monitor alert notifications and condition violations. We are replacing these pages with a new Synthetics monitor overview experience in New Relic One. This new experience provides visibility into a monitor's open violations and alert conditions with the monitor results in a single view, removing the need to open multiple tabs to view violations or alert conditions. Action items for a successful transition: No action required, but you can get ready for the new UI experience by reviewing our documentation about New Relic Applied Intelligence, which includes: The alerting functionality you are already familiar with in New Relic Alerts, and more Incident Intelligence, which reduces noise and accelerates your incident resolution process Proactive Detection, which surfaces relevant issues and provides automatic explanations to their cause",

      "body": "NerdGraph is our GraphQL-format API that lets you query New Relic data and configure some New Relic features. Tip To use our APIs, or the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is our preferred API for querying New Relic data, and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "To help you build New Relic One applications, we provide you with the New Relic One SDK. Here we give you an introduction to the types of API calls and components in the SDK. The SDK provides everything you need to build your Nerdlets, create visualizations, and fetch New Relic or third-party data. Components of the SDK SDK components are located in the Node module package named nr1, which you get when you install the NR1 CLI. The nr1 components can be divided into several categories: UI components Chart components Query and storage components Platform APIs UI components The UI components category of the SDK contains React UI components, including: Text components: These components provide basic font and heading elements. These include HeadingText and BlockText. Layout components: These components give you control over the layout, and help you build complex layout designs without having to deal with the CSS. Layout components include: Grid and GridItem: for organizing more complex, larger scale page content in rows and columns Stack and StackItem: for organizing simpler, smaller scale page content (in column or row) Tabs and TabsItem: group various related pieces of content into separate hideable sections List and ListItem: for providing a basic skeleton of virtualized lists Card, CardHeader and CardBody : used to group similar concepts and tasks together Form components: These components provide the basic building blocks to interact with the UI. These include Button, TextField, Dropdown and DropdownItem, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Radio, and Checkbox. Feedback components: These components are used to provide feedback to users about actions they have taken. These include: Spinnerand Toast. Overlaid components: These components are used to display contextual information and options in the form of an additional child view that appears above other content on screen when an action or event is triggered. They can either require user interaction (like modals), or be augmenting (like a tooltip). These include: Modal and Tooltip. Components suffixed with Item can only operate as direct children of that name without the suffix. For example: GridItem should only be found as a child of Grid. Chart components The Charts category of the SDK contains components representing different types of charts. The ChartGroup component helps a group of related charts share data and be aligned. Some chart components can perform NRQL queries on their own; some accept a customized set of data. Query and storage components The Query components category contains components for fetching and storing New Relic data. The main way to fetch data is with NerdGraph, our GraphQL endpoint. This can be queried using NerdGraphQuery. To simplify use of NerdGraph queries, we provide some components with pre-defined queries. For more on using NerdGraph, see Queries and mutations. We also provide storage for storing small data sets, such as configuration settings data, or user-specific data. For more on this, see NerdStorage. Platform APIs The Platform API components of the SDK enable your application to interact with different parts of the New Relic One platform, by reading and writing state from and to the URL, setting the configuration, etc. They can be divided into these categories: PlatformStateContext: provides read access to the platform URL state variables. Example: timeRange in the time picker. navigation: an object that allows programmatic manipulation of the navigation in New Relic One. Example: opening a new Nerdlet. NerdletStateContext: provides read access to the Nerdlet URL state variables. Example: an entityGuid in the entity explorer. nerdlet: allows you to configure your Nerdlet and write to your Nerdlet's URL state.",

Tip To use our APIs, or the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is our preferred API for querying New Relic data, and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

Recommendation: Start new projects by referring to Getting started with API and the New Relic REST API v2 examples. Also, begin migrating any of your API v1 scripts to their v2 equivalent. Account creation and value storage Using the accounts/create endpoint, create an account, subscription and user. From the payload, extract and store the account values. Typically you will create a new table in your accounts database and associate the record containing this information with your user record. The values used in this scenario include data-access-key, id, and license-key. You may want to store additional values. Deploying the agent New Relic highly recommends automatically deploying the agents for your customers if your architecture and choice of languages permit. Our experience is that even the best documented and easiest user deployment of the agent results in only a 75% success rate. Auto-deploying the agent for your customers eliminates this dropout. Whether your intention is to auto-deploy or allow the user to do so, the license key from the account creation payload is required for this operation. If you are planning a manual deploy, it is helpful to make the license key easily available to your users. This is a convenience for your users. The key is available by logging into the account. Deploying the page widget with SSO Using the data access key from the newly created account and the user's email, along with the partnership shared secret and timestamp, create a digest that can be transformed into an SHA-2 hash. The elements are assembled into the widget URL. Note: As a standard security measure for data collection, New Relic requires that your application server supports SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported.",

Webinar Co-host a webinar; for example, see: Three Powerful Tools for Improving the Performance of Your Drupal Site Six Tips for Improving Ruby Application Performance Guest blog posts New Relic loves great blog content, and partners are often an essential source; for example: Magento Auth0 Flood IO You are encouraged to write a guest blog post for http://blog.newrelic.com. What's in it for you? It's a great opportunity for you to promote your company and the integration you've built. Our blog is popular reading for the New Relic community, and our customers are frequently among the fastest growing innovators. How does it work? You draft the post and supply screenshots and/or video as applicable. New Relic will edit, format, publish, and promote the post. You'll get credit as the author, and you can include a paragraph at the end mentioning your product. How do you create a great blog post? The goal is to be insightful, useful, thought provoking, smart, surprising, and entertaining—or at least some combination of those elements. Blog post guidelines Comments Writing style Recommendation: Write your blog post in the first person. New Relic's target audience includes developers, DevOps, IT ops, execs, marketers, and data scientists working with big data, but we have no problem attracting a wider readership than that. We want to intrigue them and help them do their jobs better and more passionately. Passion and connection are essential. If you do not care about the topic you are blogging about or, more importantly, you do not appear to care about it, neither will the reader. Length A typical blog post runs approximately 500 words, but it may be longer or shorter if there is a good reason. Technical blog posts may run much longer, while posts with video may not need much text at all. Content Each post should focus on a single main idea. If you have a mashup of multiple ideas, consider breaking them up into a series of multiple, related posts. Posts do not have to be based on the latest news, but they shouldn't pretend that old news is new. If you're writing about something that's not brand new, you need to acknowledge that and come up with a fresh take or new angle. Posts should be fact based, and not mere opinion without a grounding in reality. The magic is in the details. Posts should be grounded in specifics, not just general pronouncements. If you say something is bad, you need to describe why; for example, what can or did happen because of it. Similarly, if you suggest best practices, the more specific examples you provide, the better. Links Links to outside content are encouraged, but just pointing to something on the web is not enough for a post, no matter how interesting the link is. You need to bring something unique to the post.",

Tip To use our APIs, or the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. What is NerdGraph? New Relic has several APIs. NerdGraph is our preferred API for querying New Relic data, and for performing some specific configurations (learn more about features). NerdGraph provides a single API interface for returning data from New Relic’s various APIs and microservices. Over time, other configuration capabilities will be added to NerdGraph. Important NerdGraph isn’t used for data ingest. For that, you'd use our data ingest APIs. NerdGraph is built using GraphQL, which is an open source API format that allows you to request exactly the data needed, with no over-fetching or under-fetching. For a lesson in how to use NerdGraph, watch this 7-minute video: Want to watch more video tutorials? Go to the New Relic University’s Intro to NerdGraph. Or see the online course on New Relic APIs. Use the GraphiQL explorer To get started using GraphQL, we recommend playing around with our GraphiQL explorer (GraphiQL is an open source graphical interface for using GraphQL). You can use it to explore our data schema, to read built-in object definitions, and to build and execute queries. To use GraphQL, you’ll need a user-specific New Relic API key called a user key. You can generate one or find an existing one from the GraphiQL explorer’s API key dropdown. To find the GraphiQL explorer: If your New Relic account uses an EU data center, go to api.eu.newrelic.com/graphiql. Otherwise use api.newrelic.com/graphiql. For tips on how to build queries, see Build queries. Requirements and endpoints To use NerdGraph, you need a New Relic user key, which can be generated and accessed from the GraphiQL explorer. The endpoints are: Main endpoint: https://api.newrelic.com/graphql Endpoint for accounts using EU data center: https://api.eu.newrelic.com/graphql To access the endpoint, use the following cURL command: curl -X POST https://api.newrelic.com/graphql \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'API-Key: YOUR_NEW_RELIC_USER_KEY' \\ -d '{ \"query\": \"{ requestContext { userId apiKey } }\" } ' Copy What can you do with NerdGraph? NerdGraph functionality can be broken down into two main categories: Querying New Relic data. You can fetch data for a variety of purposes, including using it in a programmatic workflow, or building a New Relic One app for custom data visualizations. Configuring New Relic features. There are a variety of configurations available and more will be added over time. You can do things like add tags, configure workloads, or customize \"golden metrics.\" You can use NerdGraph to return a wide range of New Relic data but we’ve created some tutorials for common use cases: Topic Tutorials Your monitored entities Get data about entities Understand entity relationships and dependencies (used to build service maps) Query and configure \"golden metrics\" (important entity metrics) Querying data Query using NRQL (our query language) Tags Add and manage tags Dashboards Create dashboards Export dashboards to other accounts Export dashboards as files Alerts See all alert-related tutorials Applied Intelligence View and configure topology Workloads View and configure workloads Manage keys Create and manage keys (license keys used for data ingest, and user keys) Manage data Convert event data to metric data Drop data Distributed tracing Query distributed tracing data Configure Infinite Tracing New Relic One apps Build a New Relic One app Cloud integrations (AWS, Azure, GCP) Configure cloud integrations Partners and resellers Manage subscriptions (only for partners using original pricing plan) NerdGraph terminology The following are terms that originate with GraphQL (the API format NerdGraph uses). Term Definition Queries and mutations There are two classes of GraphQL operations: Queries are basic requests used only to fetch data. These queries are not static, meaning that you can ask for more data or less data, depending on your needs. For each query, you can specify exactly what data you want to retrieve, as long as it is supported by the schema. Mutations are requests that perform an action, such as creating a resource or changing configuration. Mutations require the keyword mutation, as well as the name of the mutation. Type Data in GraphQL is organized into types. Types can be scalars (like strings, numbers, or booleans) or object types. An object type is a custom type made up of a collection of fields. For example, an object type called User may represent a user in a system. Field A field represents a piece of information on an object type that can be queried. Fields can be scalars, lists, or objects. For example, a User object type could have a string field called name. Interface An interface is an abstract type that represents a collection of common fields that other object types can implement. Tips on using the GraphiQL explorer You can make queries with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. The explorer provides built-in schema definitions and features, including auto-complete and query validation. Query accounts a New Relic user can access You can query for the name of an account that an actor (a New Relic authorized user) has access to: query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name } } } Copy The response will mirror the query structure you defined in the request, making it easy to ask for the specific data that you want. { \"data\": { \"actor\": { \"account\": { \"name\": \"Data Nerd\" } } } } Copy Query user, account, and NRQL in one request The graph structure shows its capabilities when queries become more complex. For example, you can query for user information, account information, and make a NRQL query with one request. With REST API, this would take three different requests to three different endpoints. query { actor { account(id: YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID) { name nrql(query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\") { results } } user { name id } } } Copy",

      "body": "This approach adds a new authentication method to the customer-facing New Relic REST API (v2) that allows partners (and enterprise-scale customers that use the partnership structure to manage their multiple accounts) to use their partnership credentials to authorize all REST API (v2) calls. It offers no new functionality for non-partner API users. When calling endpoints in the New Relic REST API (v2) that require the user key, New Relic suggests you use the described authentication method. Custom headers and API calls When making API calls, use the following custom headers with your partner API key, partner ID, and your account ID: X-Api-Key:YOUR_PARTNER_ACCOUNT_API_KEY NewRelic-Partner-Id:YOUR_PARTNER_ID NewRelic-Account-Id:YOUR_CUSTOMERS_ACCOUNT_ID Providing authentication to the REST API (v2) in this form allows you to complete any API operation on your customer’s accounts. This bypasses the customer-facing requirement that some API calls require an Admin user’s API key. This authentication method also works for API endpoints that require only the REST API key. This new authentication method works for all endpoints, not only those that require the Admin User’s API key. Known limitations This partner-only authentication method will only work with the New Relic REST API (v2). It does not work with the following: Deployment API Infrastructure API for alerts Insights API Insights Dashboard API Partner API Plugin API Synthetics API",

If you change it, the name of your app is updated everywhere in New Relic One, including APM, browser monitoring, etc. By default, the alias is the same as the name used in the agent configuration file. Changing the alias does not affect the agent's configured name, and data still reports using that name. Set application alias and modify Apdex thresholds To change the alias for the app name from the New Relic REST API (v2), use this command. You can also change the app alias from New Relic's API Explorer by selecting Applications > Update. You will need to supply the ${APPID}, ${API_KEY}, and the alias name you want the application to be displayed as in the New Relic UI.

If you change it, the name of your app is updated everywhere in New Relic One, including APM, browser monitoring, etc. By default, the alias is the same as the name used in the agent configuration file.

Set application alias and modify Apdex thresholds To change the alias for the app name from the New Relic REST API (v2), use this command. You can also change the app alias from New Relic's API Explorer by selecting Applications > Update. You will need to supply the ${APPID}, ${API_KEY}, and the alias name you want the application to be displayed as in the New Relic UI.

To change the time range (as shown in this example), include from and to values. To keep the default time period (last 30 minutes), omit the from and to values. To return a series of throughput values instead of an average, omit summarize. Here is an example of the Throughput chart for a non-web app on the APM Summary page.

      "body": "To ensure that New Relic correctly identifies API integration publishers, each integration needs a unique custom user agent string. If you are only using your integration internally, and don't plan on sharing it with anyone outside your organization, you don't need to set a unique custom agent string. Prerequisites This document assumes you plan to publicly distribute an integration that makes use of any of New Relic's public RESTful APIs. Examples of public distribution include: Publicizing your integration code on Github. Packaging your integration into a plugin, extension, or other package, and distributing it via a directory like WordPress Plugins. Offering an \"as a service\" integration between your product and New Relic, without actually distributing your integration code, like Runscope's integration. User agents When writing applications to work with New Relic's RESTful APIs (referred to as an integration in this document), you are creating an HTTP agent to manage information exchange between your application and New Relic. An integration identifies itself by submitting a standard identification string. In HTTP this string is included in the header field User-Agent. When using New Relic's RESTful APIs, set a User-Agent header that identifies your integration in API calls. This custom User-Agent string allows New Relic to identify the integration that is making requests to New Relic's APIs. By setting a custom user agent, New Relic can track: Usage statistics for your integration. Potentially buggy or abusive API usage. Set a user agent To set a custom user agent, include an agent string in the HTTP header User-Agent. Examples: Language Example cURL curl -H 'User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3' Copy Java (using GET) get.setHeader(\"User-Agent\", \"my-integration/1.2.3\"); Copy PHP header('User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3'); Copy The minimum user agent string is the integration name and version: name/version. You can string together multiple values in a space-separated list. The full syntax is: name/version [(comments)] [name/version [(comments)]] [...]​ Copy For the integration name, use a string that clearly and meaningfully identifies your integration. Ambiguous name: New Relic Integration Clear and meaningful name: SaaS XYZTools Integration with New Relic For the integration version, use a build ID, commit hash, or other identifier that is updated when you release new integration versions. Wrap comments in parentheses () as a semi-colon separated list; Helpful comments to include: The publicly-accessible URL of your integration. For instance, a Github URL, or a page in your docs site that describes the integration. Contact information so that New Relic can easily reach the integration publisher. Tip Information from the user agent string will never be shared, nor used by New Relic for any purpose other than discussing the integration with its publisher. Set custom user-agent for your integration You have an integration with the following identifying information: Name: MetricMeter Version: 3.2 URL: meter.me/info Contact: help@meter.me The custom user agent string would be: MetricMeter for New Relic/3.2 (meter.me/info; help​@​meter.me) Copy User agent strings and New Relic New Relic captures user agent strings from API calls to identify their source. Using custom user agent strings for publicly-available integration is a recommended best practice. Depending on your business relationship with New Relic, it may be required. Labeling your integration with a custom user agent string does not affect its interaction with New Relic's APIs.",

For large outputs, we recommend narrowing the query using application ID or another attribute. The sort order for returned data is indeterminate. Do not assume or rely on a particular order. The data returned per page depends on what data is requested. The number of pages depends on the number of JSON objects necessary to complete the list. Important Before listing metric names, see Metric name listing guidelines. Request a specific page To specify a page, add the page= parameter to the query.

      "body": "To ensure that New Relic correctly identifies API integration publishers, each integration needs a unique custom user agent string. If you are only using your integration internally, and don't plan on sharing it with anyone outside your organization, you don't need to set a unique custom agent string. Prerequisites This document assumes you plan to publicly distribute an integration that makes use of any of New Relic's public RESTful APIs. Examples of public distribution include: Publicizing your integration code on Github. Packaging your integration into a plugin, extension, or other package, and distributing it via a directory like WordPress Plugins. Offering an \"as a service\" integration between your product and New Relic, without actually distributing your integration code, like Runscope's integration. User agents When writing applications to work with New Relic's RESTful APIs (referred to as an integration in this document), you are creating an HTTP agent to manage information exchange between your application and New Relic. An integration identifies itself by submitting a standard identification string. In HTTP this string is included in the header field User-Agent. When using New Relic's RESTful APIs, set a User-Agent header that identifies your integration in API calls. This custom User-Agent string allows New Relic to identify the integration that is making requests to New Relic's APIs. By setting a custom user agent, New Relic can track: Usage statistics for your integration. Potentially buggy or abusive API usage. Set a user agent To set a custom user agent, include an agent string in the HTTP header User-Agent.

      "body": "To ensure that New Relic correctly identifies API integration publishers, each integration needs a unique custom user agent string. If you are only using your integration internally, and don't plan on sharing it with anyone outside your organization, you don't need to set a unique custom agent string. Prerequisites This document assumes you plan to publicly distribute an integration that makes use of any of New Relic's public RESTful APIs. Examples of public distribution include: Publicizing your integration code on Github. Packaging your integration into a plugin, extension, or other package, and distributing it via a directory like WordPress Plugins. Offering an \"as a service\" integration between your product and New Relic, without actually distributing your integration code, like Runscope's integration. User agents When writing applications to work with New Relic's RESTful APIs (referred to as an integration in this document), you are creating an HTTP agent to manage information exchange between your application and New Relic. An integration identifies itself by submitting a standard identification string. In HTTP this string is included in the header field User-Agent. When using New Relic's RESTful APIs, set a User-Agent header that identifies your integration in API calls. This custom User-Agent string allows New Relic to identify the integration that is making requests to New Relic's APIs. By setting a custom user agent, New Relic can track: Usage statistics for your integration. Potentially buggy or abusive API usage. Set a user agent To set a custom user agent, include an agent string in the HTTP header User-Agent. Examples: Language Example cURL curl -H 'User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3' Copy Java (using GET) get.setHeader(\"User-Agent\", \"my-integration/1.2.3\"); Copy PHP header('User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3'); Copy The minimum user agent string is the integration name and version: name/version. You can string together multiple values in a space-separated list. The full syntax is: name/version [(comments)] [name/version [(comments)]] [...]​ Copy For the integration name, use a string that clearly and meaningfully identifies your integration. Ambiguous name: New Relic Integration Clear and meaningful name: SaaS XYZTools Integration with New Relic For the integration version, use a build ID, commit hash, or other identifier that is updated when you release new integration versions. Wrap comments in parentheses () as a semi-colon separated list; Helpful comments to include: The publicly-accessible URL of your integration. For instance, a Github URL, or a page in your docs site that describes the integration. Contact information so that New Relic can easily reach the integration publisher. Tip Information from the user agent string will never be shared, nor used by New Relic for any purpose other than discussing the integration with its publisher. Set custom user-agent for your integration You have an integration with the following identifying information: Name: MetricMeter Version: 3.2 URL: meter.me/info Contact: help@meter.me The custom user agent string would be: MetricMeter for New Relic/3.2 (meter.me/info; help​@​meter.me) Copy User agent strings and New Relic New Relic captures user agent strings from API calls to identify their source. Using custom user agent strings for publicly-available integration is a recommended best practice. Depending on your business relationship with New Relic, it may be required. Labeling your integration with a custom user agent string does not affect its interaction with New Relic's APIs.",

      "body": "The New Relic REST API (v2) paginates some responses, for performance reasons. This is because returning the entire data set might be feasible for some queries but prohibitive for others that return a very large amount of data. Requirements and limitations Metric data return: Pagination is no longer available for metrics output for some customers (deprecation beginning December 2020). Returns up to 3000 results per cell. For large outputs, we recommend narrowing the query using application ID or another attribute. The sort order for returned data is indeterminate. Do not assume or rely on a particular order. The data returned per page depends on what data is requested. The number of pages depends on the number of JSON objects necessary to complete the list. Important Before listing metric names, see Metric name listing guidelines. Request a specific page To specify a page, add the page= parameter to the query. Here's an example: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_incidents.json?page=3' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy In the REST API Explorer, you can quickly change the page being viewed. Link header examples showing page count The API call returns the Link header if the data is paginated. This indicates the number of pages and the page being viewed. This line also appears at the top of the Response in the REST API Explorer. Important The Link header will only appear if the output data is paginated. Tip The rel=\"last\" reference will not be shown when making calls to the Violations endpoint (https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts_violations.json). To determine the final page when making calls to this endpoint, look for the absence of a rel=\"next\" reference. To obtain this line using some implementations of curl, you may need to include the -v option. curl -v -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/...' Copy New Relic uses the RFC 5988 standard format for links. Example: Return 3 pages The API output will contain a Link line similar to this. Lines are wrapped to improve readability. Link: <https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alert_policies.xml?page=2>;rel=\"next\", <https://api.newrelic.com/v2/alert_policies.xml?page=3>;rel=\"last\" Copy This indicates there are three pages and you are viewing the first one.

      "body": "To ensure that New Relic correctly identifies API integration publishers, each integration needs a unique custom user agent string. If you are only using your integration internally, and don't plan on sharing it with anyone outside your organization, you don't need to set a unique custom agent string. Prerequisites This document assumes you plan to publicly distribute an integration that makes use of any of New Relic's public RESTful APIs. Examples of public distribution include: Publicizing your integration code on Github. Packaging your integration into a plugin, extension, or other package, and distributing it via a directory like WordPress Plugins. Offering an \"as a service\" integration between your product and New Relic, without actually distributing your integration code, like Runscope's integration. User agents When writing applications to work with New Relic's RESTful APIs (referred to as an integration in this document), you are creating an HTTP agent to manage information exchange between your application and New Relic. An integration identifies itself by submitting a standard identification string. In HTTP this string is included in the header field User-Agent. When using New Relic's RESTful APIs, set a User-Agent header that identifies your integration in API calls. This custom User-Agent string allows New Relic to identify the integration that is making requests to New Relic's APIs. By setting a custom user agent, New Relic can track: Usage statistics for your integration. Potentially buggy or abusive API usage. Set a user agent To set a custom user agent, include an agent string in the HTTP header User-Agent. Examples: Language Example cURL curl -H 'User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3' Copy Java (using GET) get.setHeader(\"User-Agent\", \"my-integration/1.2.3\"); Copy PHP header('User-Agent: my-integration/1.2.3'); Copy The minimum user agent string is the integration name and version: name/version. You can string together multiple values in a space-separated list. The full syntax is: name/version [(comments)] [name/version [(comments)]] [...]​ Copy For the integration name, use a string that clearly and meaningfully identifies your integration. Ambiguous name: New Relic Integration Clear and meaningful name: SaaS XYZTools Integration with New Relic For the integration version, use a build ID, commit hash, or other identifier that is updated when you release new integration versions. Wrap comments in parentheses () as a semi-colon separated list; Helpful comments to include: The publicly-accessible URL of your integration. For instance, a Github URL, or a page in your docs site that describes the integration. Contact information so that New Relic can easily reach the integration publisher. Tip Information from the user agent string will never be shared, nor used by New Relic for any purpose other than discussing the integration with its publisher. Set custom user-agent for your integration You have an integration with the following identifying information: Name: MetricMeter Version: 3.2 URL: meter.me/info Contact: help@meter.me The custom user agent string would be: MetricMeter for New Relic/3.2 (meter.me/info; help​@​meter.me) Copy User agent strings and New Relic New Relic captures user agent strings from API calls to identify their source. Using custom user agent strings for publicly-available integration is a recommended best practice. Depending on your business relationship with New Relic, it may be required. Labeling your integration with a custom user agent string does not affect its interaction with New Relic's APIs.",

Possible components may include: Network time Page rendering time DOM processing time Web application time Request queuing time This describes how to use the New Relic REST API (v2) to obtain the data shown on the Browser page load time chart. General API values When making your own calculations, be aware of the following: You can change the default time range (30 minutes) used in these examples. For calculated values, the time range you specify must be consistent in all of the queries; otherwise the final calculations will be incorrect. You must replace the ${APPID} and ${API_KEY} variables in these examples with your specific application ID and corresponding REST API key. Ensure you adjust the time units returned by the API requests as needed. Network time The EndUser:average_network_time is the network latency, or time it takes for a request to make a round trip over the Internet.

Web application time The Web application time is the time spent in the application code. To calculate this value, use this equation: Web application = EndUser:total_app_time / EndUser:call_count Copy To obtain the data for this calculation, use the following commands. EndUser:total_app_time curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}/metrics/data.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -d 'names[]=EndUser&values[]=total_app_time' Copy This time is returned in seconds.

This helps you manage deployment outside of New Relic One. These API calls are useful, for example, with larger organizations deploying multiple apps, or for integration partners who facilitate New Relic account creation and browser monitoring deployments. Add browser apps To add an app to New Relic One, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key, and replace ${STRING} with the app's name in the following command. To accomplish the same task from the API Explorer, use your API key and go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore > Browser Applications > POST Create. Use the following command: curl -X POST 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"browser_application\": { \"name\": ${STRING} } }' Copy The API returns an array of data where the element is a Browser application and the data associated with it: { \"browser_application\": { \"id\": \"integer\", \"name\": \"string\", \"browser_monitoring_key\": \"string\", \"loader_script\": \"string\" } Copy API (v2) output Description Browser app id (integer) This is the unique identification code for each app in New Relic One. App name (string) This is the app's name as it appears in the New Relic One. The browser_monitoring_key (string) This a unique key that is linked to (but is not the same as) the account license key. It is used to indicate the account in New Relic One where data will be reported. It cannot be used to determine your New Relic account's license key. Browser monitoring loader_script (string) The returned loader script is a JSON-encoded JavaScript snippet that is configured with the New Relic license key and application ID. The rest of the script is static and is approximately 10k in size. The loader script must be inserted into the user’s HTML pages correctly: It must appear in the page's <head> tag before the first script tag. If there are no script tags, put the JavaScript immediately before the </head> (end of head) tag. The entire loader script must be inserted in-line, not as a link to the .js file. List all browser apps To view a list of your apps in New Relic Browser, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key in the following command. To accomplish the same task from the API Explorer, use your API key and go to rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore > Browser Applications > GET List. Use the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i Copy You can use the results to verify the account or name, and to get a copy of the loader script for the app, if needed. View specific browser apps View by name: To view a specific Browser app if you know its name, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key, and replace ${NAME} with your app's name in the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d \"filter[name]=${NAME}\" Copy View by Browser application ID: To view a specific Browser app if you know its ID, replace ${APIKEY} with your New Relic API key, and replace ${ID} with your Browser application ID in the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/browser_applications.json' \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${APIKEY}\" -i \\ -d 'filter[ids]=${ID}' Copy View multiple browser apps: To get information for multiple apps, separate the name or ID values with a comma in these commands; for example: -d 'filter[ids]=12345,23456' Copy",

      "body": "New Relic's APM assigns IDs to entities related to an application. These are used to collect information about the operation and performance from different view points. These IDs can be returned via New Relic's REST API. The IDs may include: Application ID $APP_ID for each instrumented app Host ID $HOST_ID for each host Instance ID $INSTANCE_ID if there are multiple instances of the app To list any of these IDs in the New Relic API Explorer, you need an API key. Use the API Explorer You can use the API Explorer to return a list of all product IDs for a particular product: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). Go to the API Explorer at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. From the sidebar, select (product category) > GET List. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same. Each host ID is unique and represents different items. Use the $HOST_ID to retrieve summary metrics for the host as well as specific metric timeslice values. For more information about available metrics: Go to rpm.newrelic.com. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Go to the API Explorer's Application host page at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/application_hosts/names. Host ID and summary data using the REST API Explorer To use the API Explorer to return a list of every $HOST_ID for a particular application, you will need the $APP_ID.

It offers no new functionality for non-partner API users. When calling endpoints in the New Relic REST API (v2) that require the user key, New Relic suggests you use the described authentication method. Custom headers and API calls When making API calls, use the following custom headers with your partner API key, partner ID, and your account ID: X-Api-Key:YOUR_PARTNER_ACCOUNT_API_KEY NewRelic-Partner-Id:YOUR_PARTNER_ID NewRelic-Account-Id:YOUR_CUSTOMERS_ACCOUNT_ID Providing authentication to the REST API (v2) in this form allows you to complete any API operation on your customer’s accounts. This bypasses the customer-facing requirement that some API calls require an Admin user’s API key. This authentication method also works for API endpoints that require only the REST API key. This new authentication method works for all endpoints, not only those that require the Admin User’s API key.

      "body": "New Relic's APM assigns IDs to entities related to an application. These are used to collect information about the operation and performance from different view points. These IDs can be returned via New Relic's REST API. The IDs may include: Application ID $APP_ID for each instrumented app Host ID $HOST_ID for each host Instance ID $INSTANCE_ID if there are multiple instances of the app To list any of these IDs in the New Relic API Explorer, you need an API key. Use the API Explorer You can use the API Explorer to return a list of all product IDs for a particular product: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app). Go to the API Explorer at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. From the sidebar, select (product category) > GET List. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the product ID. Use the product ID you located in your REST API calls. List application IDs Each app monitored by an APM agent is assigned a name. A unique $APP_ID is also associated with that name. The $APP_ID is fundamental for retrieving APM information about your apps. For more information about listing and using the $APP_ID, and obtaining the summary data, see Listing your app ID. List host IDs The $HOST_ID is used to get APM data for a specific host running an app. A physical server may have more than one host. For example, a web server program running on a physical server may be configured to have more than one virtual host. IDs for the host and physical server are not the same. Each host ID is unique and represents different items. Use the $HOST_ID to retrieve summary metrics for the host as well as specific metric timeslice values. For more information about available metrics: Go to rpm.newrelic.com. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Go to the API Explorer's Application host page at rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/application_hosts/names. Host ID and summary data using the REST API Explorer To use the API Explorer to return a list of every $HOST_ID for a particular application, you will need the $APP_ID. Go to the API Explorer, then select your account name from the Select an account dropdown. Enter the specific $APP_ID in the following command: curl -X GET 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/hosts.json' \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i Copy If you have an EU region account, the endpoint begins with https://api.eu.newrelic.com. Select Send Request. Browse the Response to locate the {HOST_ID} for each host. {HOST_ID} output The output will appear similar to this: { \"application_hosts\": [ { \"id\": 34966, <---<<< {HOST_ID} \"application_name\": \"Combined Production\", \"host\": \"prod-app-10.com\", \"language\": \"ruby\", \"health_status\": \"green\", \"application_summary\": { . . . }, \"links\": { \"application\": 1234, <---<<< {APP_ID} \"application_instances\": [ 13512 <---<<< {INSTANCE_ID} ], } }, { \"id\": 9999999, <---<<< {HOST_ID} \"application_name\": \"Combined Production\", \"host\": \"prod-app-11.com\", \"language\": \"ruby\", \"health_status\": \"green\", \"application_summary\": { \". . . }, \"links\": { \"application\": 1234, <---<<< {APP_ID} \"application_instances\": [ 186288 <---<<< {INSTANCE_ID} ], } }, . . .

You must also provide APP_APDEX_THRESHOLD, BROWSER_APDEX_THRESHOLD, and the monitoring enabled BOOLEAN (true or false) even if they are not being modified. curl -X PUT \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"application\": { \"name\": \"name\", \"settings\": { \"app_apdex_threshold\": APP_APDEX_THRESHOLD, \"end_user_apdex_threshold\": BROWSER_APDEX_THRESHOLD, \"enable_real_user_monitoring\": BOOLEAN } } }' Copy This is the equivalent of using the APM UI to change the displayed app name. This will not change the app identifier name under which your data will be collected. It will only change the app name that appears in the New Relic user interface.

If you change it, the name of your app is updated everywhere in New Relic One, including APM, browser monitoring, etc. By default, the alias is the same as the name used in the agent configuration file. Changing the alias does not affect the agent's configured name, and data still reports using that name. Set application alias and modify Apdex thresholds To change the alias for the app name from the New Relic REST API (v2), use this command. You can also change the app alias from New Relic's API Explorer by selecting Applications > Update. You will need to supply the ${APPID}, ${API_KEY}, and the alias name you want the application to be displayed as in the New Relic UI. You must also provide APP_APDEX_THRESHOLD, BROWSER_APDEX_THRESHOLD, and the monitoring enabled BOOLEAN (true or false) even if they are not being modified. curl -X PUT \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/${APPID}.json\" \\ -H \"X-Api-Key:${API_KEY}\" -i \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -d \\ '{ \"application\": { \"name\": \"name\", \"settings\": { \"app_apdex_threshold\": APP_APDEX_THRESHOLD, \"end_user_apdex_threshold\": BROWSER_APDEX_THRESHOLD, \"enable_real_user_monitoring\": BOOLEAN } } }' Copy This is the equivalent of using the APM UI to change the displayed app name.

It offers no new functionality for non-partner API users. When calling endpoints in the New Relic REST API (v2) that require the user key, New Relic suggests you use the described authentication method. Custom headers and API calls When making API calls, use the following custom headers with your partner API key, partner ID, and your account ID: X-Api-Key:YOUR_PARTNER_ACCOUNT_API_KEY NewRelic-Partner-Id:YOUR_PARTNER_ID NewRelic-Account-Id:YOUR_CUSTOMERS_ACCOUNT_ID Providing authentication to the REST API (v2) in this form allows you to complete any API operation on your customer’s accounts.

      "body": "Currently New Relic supports two versions of the Synthetics API: v1 and v3. Version 3 was released October 2016. Version 1 is deprecated and will eventually no longer be available. No termination date has been announced. However, no further development or modifications will be made to v1. Caution Recommendation: Create new monitors using the v3 Synthetics API and migrate v1 scripts to their v3 equivalent. To use the REST API for New Relic's synthetic monitoring, you must activate API access and generate your Admin User's API key from your account settings. Then you can make standard API calls via the command line. Managing simple and scripted monitors You must use your Admin User's API key to make Synthetics REST API calls. The account's REST API key will not work. Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. These examples show curl commands: Get all monitors To view a list of all monitors in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"count\": integer, \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } ] } Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single existing monitor in New Relic, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return the error 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your account in New Relic, send a POST request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings (send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations to get a list of valid locations) [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, } Copy In addition, to add a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\" : \"simple\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic, send a DELETE request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -X DELETE https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response, 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic, use the following command. curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations Copy Managing scripted monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the monitor types Scripted Browser (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and API Test (SCRIPT_API). These examples show curl commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script. Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. For example: curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: {Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the ${MONITOR_UUID}/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). The scriptLocations data is required only for private locations with Verified Script Execution turned on. The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm. { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. Here is an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation. curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: '{Admin_User_Key}' -H 'content-type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4\"} ]}' Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows curl commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example show the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. #!/bin/bash # Admin API key from your account settings adminAPIKey='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":\"'$encoded'\"}' curl -s -X PUT -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy Synthetics attributes Here are the attributes used with Synthetics REST API calls, listed in alphabetical order.

      "body": "Use the Synthetics REST API to create and manage synthetic monitors of all types: ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test monitors. All synthetic monitoring data is available via the REST API. To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have a user role that allows that capability and a user key. For an overview of all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Features The newest version of the Synthetics API (v3) adds these features: Synthetics API (v3) Features Options field for POST and PUT request You can specify the options for SIMPLE and BROWSER type monitors, similar to the way these options are available in the UI. PATCH request You can update only the fields of a monitor you want to change, rather than having to specify the entire monitor entity in a PUT. You can also specify the OPTION, assuming you are using the appropriate type of monitor. More detail with 400 Bad Request errors As of v3, the Synthetics API attempts to return as much information as possible when a validation failure occurs. This will help you figure out what might be wrong with the request. The API runs all validations and returns any failed validation messages, rather than failing on the first validation error as occurred in previous API versions. Pagination Large API responses are properly paginated. You can also use NRQL queries to analyze past changes made via the API. Monitor types in API These are the monitor types and how they're referred to in the API: Monitor type API name Ping SIMPLE Simple browser BROWSER Scripted browser SCRIPT_BROWSER API test SCRIPT_API Use the API To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have the ability to manage synthetics monitors and use a user key (the REST API key won't work). This API can be used for all Synthetics monitors. (Additional API methods for scripted browser and API test monitors are also available to update the script associated with those monitors.) All Synthetics data is available via the API. API examples show cURL commands. For US-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy For EU-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.eu.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. Get all monitors To view a list of all the monitors in your New Relic account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": \"2a1bc369-7654-489d-918e-f6g135h7i2jk\", \"name\": \"monitor1\", \"type\": \"BROWSER\", \"frequency\": 60, \"uri\": \"http://example.com\", \"locations\": [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\": \"DISABLED\", \"slaThreshold\": 7, \"options\": {}, \"modifiedAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"createdAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"userId\": 0, \"apiVersion\": \"0.2.2\" } ], \"count\": 1 } Copy Query arguments: offset: The monitor count offset. Defaults to 0. For example, if you have 40 monitors and you use an offset value of 20, it will return monitors 21-40. limit: The number of results per page, maximum 100. Defaults to 20. You can include these in your cURL command as follows: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -G -d 'offset=20&limit=100' Copy The headers include a Link to help you easily page your monitors. For example: <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=0&limit=20>; rel=\"first\", <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=40&limit=20>; rel=\"last\" Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single Synthetics monitor, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your Synthetics account, send a POST request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor. All fields in the following example are required unless stated otherwise: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, \"options\": { \"validationString\": string [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"verifySSL\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"bypassHEADRequest\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types], \"treatRedirectAsFailure\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types] } } Copy In addition, to add the script for a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values: curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\", \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\" : \"1.0\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example: the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. All fields are required. However, the TYPE of the monitor cannot be changed. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\": \"monitor type\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Patch an existing monitor To patch an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PATCH request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PATCH -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\" }' Copy PATCH requests are intended to update individual attributes of your New Relic Synthetics monitor rather than updating the entire entity, so you may provide only the attributes you want to update. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds, or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic Synthetics, send a DELETE request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -X DELETE $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get a list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic Synthetics, use the following command: curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v1/locations Copy Script API for scripted browser and API test monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted Browsers (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and API test browsers (SCRIPT_API). These examples show cURL commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script. For example: curl -v -H 'Api-Key: $API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic Synthetics with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the $MONITOR_UUID/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":BASE64 encoded string}' curl -v -X PUT \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_UUID/script \\ -d $scriptPayload Copy If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Using private location scripts with verified script execution When creating or updating monitors for private locations that have verified script execution turned on, you must use scriptLocations to set the password: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. If you have multiple locations with Verified script execution enabled each location must have the HMAC calculated. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm with the script and password. Here's an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation: curl -v -X PUT -H 'Api-Key: '$API_KEY' -H 'content-type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT}/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4ZQ==\"} ]}' Copy Important You must remove the last newline character from both the script and the calculated HMAC value before encoding in BASE64. Calculation steps: Calculate the HMAC value from the script. One way is to use: cat script | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac \"password\" > hmac Remove the newline character if one was added by openssl. Encode the HMAC in BASE64 without line breaks. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows cURL commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example shows the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor.

      "body": "Currently New Relic supports two versions of the Synthetics API: v1 and v3. Version 3 was released October 2016. Version 1 is deprecated and will eventually no longer be available. No termination date has been announced. However, no further development or modifications will be made to v1. Caution Recommendation: Create new monitors using the v3 Synthetics API and migrate v1 scripts to their v3 equivalent. To use the REST API for New Relic's synthetic monitoring, you must activate API access and generate your Admin User's API key from your account settings. Then you can make standard API calls via the command line. Managing simple and scripted monitors You must use your Admin User's API key to make Synthetics REST API calls. The account's REST API key will not work. Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. These examples show curl commands: Get all monitors To view a list of all monitors in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"count\": integer, \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } ] } Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single existing monitor in New Relic, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return the error 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your account in New Relic, send a POST request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings (send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations to get a list of valid locations) [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, } Copy In addition, to add a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\" : \"simple\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic, send a DELETE request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -X DELETE https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response, 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic, use the following command. curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations Copy Managing scripted monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the monitor types Scripted Browser (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and API Test (SCRIPT_API). These examples show curl commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script. Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. For example: curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: {Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the ${MONITOR_UUID}/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). The scriptLocations data is required only for private locations with Verified Script Execution turned on. The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm. { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. Here is an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation. curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: '{Admin_User_Key}' -H 'content-type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4\"} ]}' Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows curl commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example show the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. #!/bin/bash # Admin API key from your account settings adminAPIKey='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":\"'$encoded'\"}' curl -s -X PUT -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy Synthetics attributes Here are the attributes used with Synthetics REST API calls, listed in alphabetical order.

      "body": "Currently New Relic supports two versions of the Synthetics API: v1 and v3. Version 3 was released October 2016. Version 1 is deprecated and will eventually no longer be available. No termination date has been announced. However, no further development or modifications will be made to v1. Caution Recommendation: Create new monitors using the v3 Synthetics API and migrate v1 scripts to their v3 equivalent. To use the REST API for New Relic's synthetic monitoring, you must activate API access and generate your Admin User's API key from your account settings. Then you can make standard API calls via the command line. Managing simple and scripted monitors You must use your Admin User's API key to make Synthetics REST API calls. The account's REST API key will not work. Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. These examples show curl commands: Get all monitors To view a list of all monitors in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"count\": integer, \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } ] } Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single existing monitor in New Relic, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return the error 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your account in New Relic, send a POST request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings (send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations to get a list of valid locations) [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, } Copy In addition, to add a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\" : \"simple\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic, send a DELETE request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}. Replace the { id} in the following example with the specific monitor ID. curl -v \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' \\ -X DELETE https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id} Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response, 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic, use the following command. curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'X-Api-Key:{Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/locations Copy Managing scripted monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the monitor types Scripted Browser (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and API Test (SCRIPT_API). These examples show curl commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a GET request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script. Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. For example: curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: {Admin_User_Key}' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the ${MONITOR_UUID}/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic for your account, send a PUT request to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). The scriptLocations data is required only for private locations with Verified Script Execution turned on. The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm. { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy Replace the { id} with the specific monitor ID. Here is an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation. curl -v -H 'X-Api-Key: '{Admin_User_Key}' -H 'content-type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors/{id}/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4\"} ]}' Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows curl commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example show the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. #!/bin/bash # Admin API key from your account settings adminAPIKey='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":\"'$encoded'\"}' curl -s -X PUT -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy Synthetics attributes Here are the attributes used with Synthetics REST API calls, listed in alphabetical order. Synthetics API attribute Definition apiVersion String: The version number. emails Array of strings: Email addresses for alert notifications with New Relic. frequency Integer: Number of minutes between checks. Valid values include 1, 5, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, and 1440. id The UUID for the specific Synthetics monitor. locations Array of strings: Array of locations by full label. name String: The monitor's name. scriptLocations String: The name and hmac values for private locations using Verified Script Execution. scriptText String: The BASE64 encoded text for scripted monitors. slaThreshold Double: Value for the Synthetics SLA report, in seconds. status String: Valid values include ENABLED, MUTED, and DISABLED. type String: Type of monitor. Valid values include: SIMPLE (Ping) BROWSER SCRIPT_BROWSER SCRIPT_API uri String: The URI for SIMPLE and BROWSER monitor types; for example, http://my-site.com. Optional for SCRIPT_BROWSER and SCRIPT_API. userID Integer: The specific user ID. Specific monitor endpoint When making REST API calls for a specific monitor, include the monitor_uuid as part of the endpoint. The monitor_uuid is the GUID which is part of the URL. For example, a selected Synthetics monitor has this URL: https://synthetics.newrelic.com/accounts/nnnn/monitors/ab123-c456d-e78-90123-f45g Copy The monitor_uuid is the value that follows /monitors/.

      "body": "Use the Synthetics REST API to create and manage synthetic monitors of all types: ping, simple browser, scripted browser, and API test monitors. All synthetic monitoring data is available via the REST API. To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have a user role that allows that capability and a user key. For an overview of all available New Relic APIs, see Intro to APIs. Features The newest version of the Synthetics API (v3) adds these features: Synthetics API (v3) Features Options field for POST and PUT request You can specify the options for SIMPLE and BROWSER type monitors, similar to the way these options are available in the UI. PATCH request You can update only the fields of a monitor you want to change, rather than having to specify the entire monitor entity in a PUT. You can also specify the OPTION, assuming you are using the appropriate type of monitor. More detail with 400 Bad Request errors As of v3, the Synthetics API attempts to return as much information as possible when a validation failure occurs. This will help you figure out what might be wrong with the request. The API runs all validations and returns any failed validation messages, rather than failing on the first validation error as occurred in previous API versions. Pagination Large API responses are properly paginated. You can also use NRQL queries to analyze past changes made via the API. Monitor types in API These are the monitor types and how they're referred to in the API: Monitor type API name Ping SIMPLE Simple browser BROWSER Scripted browser SCRIPT_BROWSER API test SCRIPT_API Use the API To use the Synthetics REST API, you must have the ability to manage synthetics monitors and use a user key (the REST API key won't work). This API can be used for all Synthetics monitors. (Additional API methods for scripted browser and API test monitors are also available to update the script associated with those monitors.) All Synthetics data is available via the API. API examples show cURL commands. For US-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy For EU-based accounts, use the following endpoint: https://synthetics.eu.newrelic.com/synthetics/api Copy Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code. Get all monitors To view a list of all the monitors in your New Relic account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors. For example: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"monitors\": [ { \"id\": \"2a1bc369-7654-489d-918e-f6g135h7i2jk\", \"name\": \"monitor1\", \"type\": \"BROWSER\", \"frequency\": 60, \"uri\": \"http://example.com\", \"locations\": [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\": \"DISABLED\", \"slaThreshold\": 7, \"options\": {}, \"modifiedAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"createdAt\": \"2016-09-26T23:12:46.981+0000\", \"userId\": 0, \"apiVersion\": \"0.2.2\" } ], \"count\": 1 } Copy Query arguments: offset: The monitor count offset. Defaults to 0. For example, if you have 40 monitors and you use an offset value of 20, it will return monitors 21-40. limit: The number of results per page, maximum 100. Defaults to 20. You can include these in your cURL command as follows: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -G -d 'offset=20&limit=100' Copy The headers include a Link to help you easily page your monitors. For example: <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=0&limit=20>; rel=\"first\", <https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors/?offset=40&limit=20>; rel=\"last\" Copy Get a specific monitor To view a single Synthetics monitor, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"id\": UUID, \"name\": string, \"type\": string, \"frequency\": integer, \"uri\": string, \"locations\": array of strings, \"status\": string, \"slaThreshold\": double, \"userId\": integer, \"apiVersion\": string } Copy An invalid monitor ID will return 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist. Create a monitor To add a new monitor to your Synthetics account, send a POST request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors with a JSON payload that describes the monitor. All fields in the following example are required unless stated otherwise: { \"name\": string [required], \"type\": string (SIMPLE, BROWSER, SCRIPT_API, SCRIPT_BROWSER) [required], \"frequency\": integer (minutes) [required, must be one of 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 360, 720, or 1440], \"uri\": string [required for SIMPLE and BROWSER type], \"locations\": array of strings [at least one required], \"status\": string (ENABLED, MUTED, DISABLED) [required], \"slaThreshold\": double, \"options\": { \"validationString\": string [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"verifySSL\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE and BROWSER types], \"bypassHEADRequest\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types], \"treatRedirectAsFailure\": boolean (true, false) [only valid for SIMPLE types] } } Copy In addition, to add the script for a scripted monitor via the REST API, call an additional API endpoint to send the script for the monitor just created. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Replace the Synthetics REST API attributes in the following example with your specific values: curl -v \\ -X POST -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"monitor1\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"type\" : \"browser\", \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\" : \"1.0\"}' Copy A successful request will return a 201 Created response, with the URI of the newly-created monitor specified in the location header. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example: the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 402 Payment Required: Creating the monitor will increase your scheduled checks past your account's purchased check limit. Update an existing monitor To update an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. In addition, for scripted monitors, follow the procedures to update the BASE64 encoded script. All fields are required. However, the TYPE of the monitor cannot be changed. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PUT -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\", \"type\": \"monitor type\", \"frequency\" : 15, \"uri\" : \"http://my-uri.com/\", \"locations\" : [ \"AWS_US_WEST_1\" ], \"status\" : \"enabled\", \"slaThreshold\": \"7.0\" }' Copy PUT requests are intended to replace target entities, so all attributes required in the JSON payload when creating a new monitor are also required when updating an existing monitor. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Patch an existing monitor To patch an existing monitor in New Relic, send a PATCH request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID. Use a specific monitor ID, and replace the Synthetics REST API attributes with your specific values. curl -v \\ -X PATCH -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID \\ -d '{ \"name\" : \"updated monitor name\" }' Copy PATCH requests are intended to update individual attributes of your New Relic Synthetics monitor rather than updating the entire entity, so you may provide only the attributes you want to update. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: One or more of the monitor values is invalid, or the format of the request is invalid. For example, the frequency is out of bounds, or one or more of the specified locations is invalid. (See the error message in the body of the response.) 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Delete an existing monitor To delete an existing monitor in New Relic Synthetics, send a DELETE request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID: curl -v \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -X DELETE $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID Copy A successful request will return a 204 No Content response, with an empty body. An unsuccessful request will return the response 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Get a list of valid locations To retrieve the list of valid locations in New Relic Synthetics, use the following command: curl -v \\ -X GET -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v1/locations Copy Script API for scripted browser and API test monitors In addition to the general API, there are several API methods for the scripted Browsers (SCRIPT_BROWSER) and API test browsers (SCRIPT_API). These examples show cURL commands. Get monitor script To view the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a GET request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script. For example: curl -v -H 'Api-Key: $API_KEY' $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script Copy A successful request will return a 200 OK response. The data returned will be a JSON object in the following format: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded string } Copy Possible error codes include: 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor doesn't exist or the script associated with the monitor doesn't exist. Add scripted monitor To add a new scripted monitor to New Relic Synthetics with the REST API: Follow standard API procedures to add a new monitor, and identify the type as a SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. Update the new monitor with a BASE64 encoded version of the script to the $MONITOR_UUID/script endpoint. For more information, refer to the example. If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. Update monitor script To update the script associated with a specific SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API monitor in New Relic Synthetics for your account, send a PUT request to $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script with a JSON payload that contains the scriptText (required). scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":BASE64 encoded string}' curl -v -X PUT \\ -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ $API_ENDPOINT/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_UUID/script \\ -d $scriptPayload Copy If you are using private locations with verified script execution enabled, see script locations with verified script execution. A successful request will return a 204 No Content response with an empty body. Possible error codes include: 400 Bad Request: Invalid BASE64 encoded string for scriptText or hmac. 403 Forbidden: The specified monitor is not of the type SCRIPT_BROWSER or SCRIPT_API. 404 Not Found: The specified monitor does not exist. Using private location scripts with verified script execution When creating or updating monitors for private locations that have verified script execution turned on, you must use scriptLocations to set the password: { \"scriptText\": BASE64 encoded String, \"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": Location name, \"hmac\" BASE64 encoded String of SHA256 HMAC for location } ] } Copy The password used to generate the HMAC string must match the password set for the private location. If you have multiple locations with Verified script execution enabled each location must have the HMAC calculated. When generating the HMAC string, use the SHA256 algorithm with the script and password. Here's an example for the script: var assert = require('assert'); assert.equal('1', '1'); Copy This example uses password as the password for the scriptLocation: curl -v -X PUT -H 'Api-Key: '$API_KEY' -H 'content-type: application/json' $API_ENDPOINT}/v3/monitors/$MONITOR_ID/script -d '{ \"scriptText\": \"dmFyIGFzc2VydCA9IHJlcXVpcmUoJ2Fzc2VydCcpOw0KYXNzZXJ0LmVxdWFsKCcxJywgJzEnKTs=\",\"scriptLocations\": [ { \"name\": \"my_vse_enabled_location\", \"hmac\": \"MjhiNGE4MjVlMDE1N2M4NDQ4MjNjNDFkZDEyYTRjMmUzZDE3NGJlNjU0MWFmOTJlMzNiODExOGU2ZjhkZTY4ZQ==\"} ]}' Copy Important You must remove the last newline character from both the script and the calculated HMAC value before encoding in BASE64. Calculation steps: Calculate the HMAC value from the script. One way is to use: cat script | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac \"password\" > hmac Remove the newline character if one was added by openssl. Encode the HMAC in BASE64 without line breaks. Scripted browser example Here is an example of using New Relic's REST API and the bash script to create a scripted browser monitor. Scripted browser API example The following example shows cURL commands to create a scripted browser monitor. At the top of the script, replace the variables with your specific values. For the scriptfile variable, identify the filename for the script to be created. Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example shows the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. Tip In some cases you may want to use -w 0, which will disable line wrapping: base64 -w 0 $scriptfile #!/bin/bash # API key from your account settings API_KEY='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -H 'Content-Type:application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v3/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload=\"{\\\"scriptText\\\":\\\"$encoded\\\"}\" curl -s -X PUT -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" -H 'Content-Type:application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy",

      "body": "Currently New Relic supports two versions of the Synthetics API: v1 and v3. Version 3 was released October 2016. Version 1 is deprecated and will eventually no longer be available. No termination date has been announced. However, no further development or modifications will be made to v1. Caution Recommendation: Create new monitors using the v3 Synthetics API and migrate v1 scripts to their v3 equivalent. To use the REST API for New Relic's synthetic monitoring, you must activate API access and generate your Admin User's API key from your account settings. Then you can make standard API calls via the command line. Managing simple and scripted monitors You must use your Admin User's API key to make Synthetics REST API calls. The account's REST API key will not work. Caution The Synthetics REST API limits an account's rate of requests to three requests per second. Requests made in excess of this threshold will return a 429 response code.

Here is a sample script that can be saved as sample_synth_script.js to use in the example: var assert = require(\"assert\"); $browser.get(\"http://example.com\").then(function(){ // Check the H1 title matches \"Example Domain\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"h1\")).then(function(element){ return element.getText().then(function(text){ assert.equal(\"Example Domain\", text, \"Page H1 title did not match\"); }); }); }).then(function(){ // Check that the external link matches \"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\" return $browser.findElement($driver.By.css(\"div > p > a\")).then(function(element){ return element.getAttribute(\"href\").then(function(link){ assert.equal(\"http://www.iana.org/domains/example\", link, \"More information link did not match\"); }); }); }); Copy Bash script example This example show the bash script that will create the SCRIPTED_BROWSER monitor. #!/bin/bash # Admin API key from your account settings adminAPIKey='' # Other attributes found at https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/synthetics-rest-api/monitor-examples/attributes-synthetics-rest-api#api-attributes monitorName='Test API Script' monitorType='SCRIPT_BROWSER' frequency=1440 locations='\"AWS_US_WEST_1\", \"AWS_US_EAST_1\"' slaThreshold=7.0 # Location of the file with your script scriptfile=sample_synth_script.js # Test that the script file exists (does not validate content) if [ -e \"$scriptfile\" ] then script=$(cat \"$scriptfile\") payload=\"{ \\\"name\\\" : \\\"$monitorName\\\", \\\"frequency\\\" : $frequency, \\\"locations\\\" : [ $locations ], \\\"status\\\" : \\\"ENABLED\\\", \\\"type\\\" : \\\"$monitorType\\\", \\\"slaThreshold\\\" : $slaThreshold, \\\"uri\\\":\\\"\\\"}\" echo \"Creating monitor\" # Make cURL call to API and parse response headers to get monitor UUID shopt -s extglob # Required to trim whitespace; see below while IFS=':' read key value; do # trim whitespace in \"value\" value=${value##+([[:space:]])}; value=${value%%+([[:space:]])} case \"$key\" in location) LOCATION=\"$value\" ;; HTTP*) read PROTO STATUS MSG <<< \"$key{$value:+:$value}\" ;; esac done < <(curl -sS -i -X POST -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://synthetics.newrelic.com/synthetics/api/v1/monitors -d \"$payload\") # Validate monitor creation & add script unless it failed if [ $STATUS = 201 ]; then echo \"Monitor created, $LOCATION \" echo \"Uploading script\" # base64 encode script encoded=`echo \"$script\" | base64` scriptPayload='{\"scriptText\":\"'$encoded'\"}' curl -s -X PUT -H \"X-Api-Key:$adminAPIKey\" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \"$LOCATION/script\" -d $scriptPayload echo \"Script uploaded\" else echo \"Monitor creation failed\" fi else echo \"script file not found, not creating monitor\" fi Copy Synthetics attributes Here are the attributes used with Synthetics REST API calls, listed in alphabetical order.

      "body": "With Errors in New Relic One, you can see the line of code that's causing a bad experience for your users, and get enough data to reproduce the issue so you can fix it. When you do, you’ll be able to confirm your fix is working in production. Use Errors in New Relic One to: Group and filter events to triage important errors. Get alert notifications about errors. Review stack traces, logs, and other details. Share the error information with charts and dashboards. Report new errors using instrumentation, prevent certain errors from being reported, and filter out noisy errors using expected errors. View the APM Errors page To view the Errors page: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app), then click the Error rate table's title on your selected app's Summary page. OR Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors. APM Errors UI: The Error rate chart always shows the rate for all errors, even if a filter is applied. To drill down further, use grouping and filter options for the Top 5 by count chart and Error traces table. Use the Instance dropdown to focus on a specific instance. Use the Errors workflow to identify problems Use this basic workflow to get the most out of the information you see from the Errors page. Start with the Error rate chart to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with errors in general. Correlate any general patterns on the Top 5 errors chart to alerts occurring during the same time period. Use the groups and filters to examine the error events and attributes in more detail, and look for patterns with error messages, transaction names, or other groupings. Explore and share Error trace table information, including specific stack trace details, logs, and attributes (host, URL, user, custom attributes, etc.) Also review the Error profiles page to guide your investigation into which attribute values might be correlated to the cause of errors, by comparing the frequency of those values between transactions where the error did and didn't occur (only in the old UI). Error rate chart: See patterns immediately Start with the Error rate chart to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with errors in general. For example, are there any spikes near a recent deployment? You may want to change the selected time period to look for other historical patterns. This chart always shows the overall error rate and count for the selected time period, even when you filter the rest of the page. If you want to focus your investigation on a particular type of error, use the Top 5 errors chart or the Error traces table. Top five errors: Correlate to alerts or find significant groupings Use the Top 5 errors chart to identify what error types and how many of those errors occurred during the same time period as the Error rate chart. For example: Is the error spike related to a specific exception class or transaction? Do the top errors point to a new host/container that recently got moved into production? Are the top error messages repeatedly about failed connections by hosts that you know are in a specific region of your organization? Have the chart backgrounds changed color to indicate an alert condition? (Light pink indicates the alert condition's Warning threshold, and dark pink indicates the Critical threshold.) If you want to... Do this... Change the \"top 5\" selection By default, Top 5 errors chart shows the top five errors by error class and transaction name. To group by other attributes, such as error message, host, or custom attribute, use the search bar. Explore or share error trend data The Top 5 errors chart uses error events, which include rich attribute data b default, along with any custom attributes you have added to the error event type. To examine this data in more detail, or to share it with others, select the View query or Add to dashboard links that appear when you click the chart's ... menu. Error traces: Find the line of code and data needed to reproduce the issue The Error traces table groups errors by the attributes you've selected, and links them to relevant detailed error traces. Each row helps you find answers to questions such as: How many of this transaction/class (or custom grouping) occurred within the selected time period? What is the most recent error message? When did this error first and last occur? Sometimes it may be useful to sort error trace data other than from the most to fewest occurrences. You can change the sort order or filter options to focus on just the types of errors that matter the most to you and your teams. For example: Which error has the fewest occurrences (sort on Errors column)? When did a particular error stop (sort on Last occurred)? Once you find the group of errors you want to fix, click a row in the Error traces table to drill down into the stack traces and attribute data that help pinpoint the cause. Expected errors Reduce noisy errors by marking them as “expected errors”. Such errors won't affect reported error rate or Apdex metrics. See Manage errors for more details. Expected errors aren't shown by default on the Errors page. You can show them by turning on the Show N expected errors switch below the Group by bar. Errors outside transactions Using the New Relic agent API, you can record custom errors at any point in the execution of your code. Sometimes, such custom errors will occur when a transaction is not executing, such as in high-volume aynchronous code that doesn't handle an HTTP transaction. Errors outside transactions are shown by default on the Errors page, but you can hide them by turning off the Show N errors outside transactions switch below the Group by bar. Select the time period for error data Use the time picker to examine details of error events over the past week. The error events view is available for up to a seven-day window of data collected over the last eight days. You may notice slight differences in count if your time window is set to ending now. This occurs because the counts for the list and table may be requested at slightly different times as the page auto-refreshes.",

      "body": "New Relic's APM Errors page helps you identify, triage, and fix errors in your services. The Errors page uses data collected by the APM agent to display stack traces, transaction attributes such as HTTP header values, and any other custom attributes, so you can understand the context of the error and fix it. Error data types: events and trace details By default, our APM agents collect two type of error data: Events Trace details Events The error event data type includes default attributes, as well as any custom attributes instrumented in your service. It doesn't include a stack trace. Find your events data in the Errors UI as follows: The Errors column in the Error traces table. The Top 5 errors chart. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors not displaying a stack trace are based on this type of data. You can disable Show only errors with stack trace to show errors that have this type of data collected, but no associated trace details. Events are subject to sampling (see Caps on error reporting and Charting error rates and counts). For more on error event data, see Events reported by APM. Trace details The trace details error data type includes stack traces and attributes, and supplements events with more data. It's expected that more events will be reported than trace details--see Caps on error reporting. Find your trace details data in the Errors UI as follows: The “Stack traces” column of the Error traces table. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors with a stack trace use this type of data: Show only errors with stack trace is enabled by default, to constrain the errors shown to just those that have this type of data collected. This data is governed by specific retention rules for Error details. Caps on error reporting New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute per agent instance 20 trace details per minute per agent instance These caps prevent error reporting from negatively impacting application performance. Examples: App running across five EC2 instances, one JVM each. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 5 instances = 500 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 5 instances = 100 trace details per minute App running on one host with ten instances. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 10 instances = 1000 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 10 instances = 200 events per minute Charting error rates and counts The Error rate chart is driven by a query on metric timeslice data, which is an unsampled aggregate data type that is accurate but has very limited dimensionality. This data can't be faceted or filtered as flexibly as error event data. You can reproduce this chart in a dashboard, or explore the metric timeslice data further by clicking the ... menu on the Error rate chart, and then using the View query or Add to dashboard options. To chart faceted error counts using event data, as in the Top 5 errors chart, use an NRQL event query. Click the ... menu on the Top 5 errors chart and choose View query for a starting point in creating your chart. Since event data can be sampled (see Caps on error reporting), you can use the EXTRAPOLATE keyword to get an accurate error count, even if sampling is occurring. Report custom errors You can report errors not collected by default with our agents using our agent APIs. For more, see the documentation on the API. Ignore errors You can prevent certain errors that would normally be reported to New Relic from being collected using our agent APIs or the server-side configuration UI. For more details, see Manage errors in APM. Reduce noise with expected errors Sometimes you want to collect error data, but not have those errors wake you up through alerts. Using the agent API, you can mark such errors as “expected”. They’ll still be visible in the Errors page, but won’t affect your service’s error rate or Apdex metrics. Disable error traces To prevent certain errors from being reported to New Relic, disable them in your agent's configuration file.

      "body": "When DevOps experts need to track down what causes errors in your app, it may not be easy to identify the cause. New Relic APM's error profiles automatically compare one set of events to another. Each error profile provides visual details about significant differences in the frequency of different values for the events. For each attribute, the error profile includes: A pie chart showing how the error's attribute is distributed for values that deviate the most A table comparing the error attribute's distribution to that of non-erroring transactions This helps you take more of the guesswork out of resolving your app errors. You can more easily determine if you can safely ignore the error, or if you should attempt to resolve the error with a new deployment, code edits, customer communications, or other actions. Tip To view error profiles, you must use the classic APM view in New Relic One. To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. Error profile attribute examples Error profiles appear as a separate tab on your New Relic APM Errors page. Error profiles feature in New Relic APM Use error profiles to troubleshoot trends and significant differences in the frequency of error events for your app. An error profile is a collection of attributes with significantly different traits compared to non-errors. An attribute is \"unusual\" if a set of events represent what is normal (for example, errors compared to all traffic for a given time window), or differences between similar criteria (for example, two different hosts). Errors may be related to events such as: Specific web transaction names or non-web transaction names, JVM thread names, etc. Unique types of error messages, classes, etc. Random customer interactions; for example, a particular error comes from a single customer's account, while normal traffic comes from a wide variety of accounts External call counts or duration Timing differences among hosts in your ecosystem, cluster agent IDs, etc. Other anomalies Select error profile criteria Based on criteria in your app's Errors page, New Relic analyzes and lists unusual trends by their significance. Your selected criteria includes: Time window Errors page filters Search criteria on the Errors page or the Error profiles tab As you examine error profile results and want to dig deeper, add or change your app's error profile criteria. The Error profile tab refreshes to show the traits that distinguish the errors that match the updated criteria. Error profile criteria example Your app's Error profile tab currently shows several error classes or messages. To filter to a specific error class or message, use any of these options: From the Errors page's time picker, change the time range. For example, change the default (30 minutes) to Last 24 hours, ending now. From the Errors page's filter section: Select Back to groupings list, then select other Error groups, Error attributes, or Custom attributes. From the Errors page's filter section: Click a specific item on the list to narrow the filter. For example, if several error messages are listed, click only the message you are interested in. From the Error profiles tab's search box, type class, message, or other search values. Analyze error profile results To examine details for the attribute results in your app's error profile, you must use the classic APM view in New Relic One. Go to one.newrelic.com/apm > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors, then toggle Show new view so that APM shows the classic view of the Errors page. From the Errors page, select the Error profile tab. From the Error profile tab, review the list of error attributes that match the currently selected error profile criteria. To view a specific attribute's details, click it. To highlight specific error details, mouse over any pie chart segment or table row for the attribute. To investigate a specific attribute for your app's errors, type its name in the Error profiles tab's search window, or change the currently selected error profile criteria. Compare values with large differences to identify the traits that distinguish the errors for an attribute. The comparative data in the error profile results and the error trace details can help you decide what steps to take for additional troubleshooting and resolving the error. Error and non-error distribution Depending on an error's attributes, sometimes the attribute is distributed differently for errors than for non-errors. Top deviating values New Relic analyzes each attribute for your app's errors and compares the distribution for errors that match your criteria to transactions without errors. If the proportions between these errors are roughly the same compared to transactions without any errors, the attribute does not contain much useful information for debugging. New Relic limits the error profile's pie chart and table for each attribute to show only the top deviating values. When proportions are roughly the same, New Relic does not include them in the error profile. Other category After the top deviating values, the error profile groups the rest into an Other category. This helps you focus on the values that are different for these errors. No value category If values are unusually present or are not present in the errors, you may see a No value category on the list of error profiles. Filters If you do not have any filters selected, the profile shows any distinguishing traits your errors exhibit in aggregate. Example: A certain kind of transaction makes up 20% of all of your traffic and is responsible for 80% of your errors. The error profile will show the unexpected proportions in the Transaction attribute. Adjust your error profile criteria to drill down even deeper into the profile results, so you can more effectively troubleshoot and resolve specific error events.",

      "body": "New Relic's APM Errors page helps you identify, triage, and fix errors in your services. The Errors page uses data collected by the APM agent to display stack traces, transaction attributes such as HTTP header values, and any other custom attributes, so you can understand the context of the error and fix it. Error data types: events and trace details By default, our APM agents collect two type of error data: Events Trace details Events The error event data type includes default attributes, as well as any custom attributes instrumented in your service. It doesn't include a stack trace. Find your events data in the Errors UI as follows: The Errors column in the Error traces table. The Top 5 errors chart. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors not displaying a stack trace are based on this type of data. You can disable Show only errors with stack trace to show errors that have this type of data collected, but no associated trace details. Events are subject to sampling (see Caps on error reporting and Charting error rates and counts). For more on error event data, see Events reported by APM. Trace details The trace details error data type includes stack traces and attributes, and supplements events with more data. It's expected that more events will be reported than trace details--see Caps on error reporting. Find your trace details data in the Errors UI as follows: The “Stack traces” column of the Error traces table. When you’ve drilled into a grouping of errors, those errors with a stack trace use this type of data: Show only errors with stack trace is enabled by default, to constrain the errors shown to just those that have this type of data collected. This data is governed by specific retention rules for Error details. Caps on error reporting New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute per agent instance 20 trace details per minute per agent instance These caps prevent error reporting from negatively impacting application performance. Examples: App running across five EC2 instances, one JVM each. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 5 instances = 500 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 5 instances = 100 trace details per minute App running on one host with ten instances. New Relic caps error reporting at: 100 events per minute x 10 instances = 1000 events per minute 20 trace details per minute x 10 instances = 200 events per minute Charting error rates and counts The Error rate chart is driven by a query on metric timeslice data, which is an unsampled aggregate data type that is accurate but has very limited dimensionality. This data can't be faceted or filtered as flexibly as error event data. You can reproduce this chart in a dashboard, or explore the metric timeslice data further by clicking the ... menu on the Error rate chart, and then using the View query or Add to dashboard options. To chart faceted error counts using event data, as in the Top 5 errors chart, use an NRQL event query. Click the ... menu on the Top 5 errors chart and choose View query for a starting point in creating your chart. Since event data can be sampled (see Caps on error reporting), you can use the EXTRAPOLATE keyword to get an accurate error count, even if sampling is occurring. Report custom errors You can report errors not collected by default with our agents using our agent APIs. For more, see the documentation on the API. Ignore errors You can prevent certain errors that would normally be reported to New Relic from being collected using our agent APIs or the server-side configuration UI. For more details, see Manage errors in APM. Reduce noise with expected errors Sometimes you want to collect error data, but not have those errors wake you up through alerts. Using the agent API, you can mark such errors as “expected”. They’ll still be visible in the Errors page, but won’t affect your service’s error rate or Apdex metrics. Disable error traces To prevent certain errors from being reported to New Relic, disable them in your agent's configuration file. For most agents, you can ignore certain error codes or disable errors completely. For more information, see your specific agent's configuration documentation: C SDK Go (not applicable; the agent only reports errors when configured to do so) Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby Delete error traces Caution You cannot recover error traces after you delete them.

Error and non-error distribution Depending on an error's attributes, sometimes the attribute is distributed differently for errors than for non-errors. Top deviating values New Relic analyzes each attribute for your app's errors and compares the distribution for errors that match your criteria to transactions without errors. If the proportions between these errors are roughly the same compared to transactions without any errors, the attribute does not contain much useful information for debugging. New Relic limits the error profile's pie chart and table for each attribute to show only the top deviating values. When proportions are roughly the same, New Relic does not include them in the error profile. Other category After the top deviating values, the error profile groups the rest into an Other category. This helps you focus on the values that are different for these errors. No value category If values are unusually present or are not present in the errors, you may see a No value category on the list of error profiles. Filters If you do not have any filters selected, the profile shows any distinguishing traits your errors exhibit in aggregate. Example: A certain kind of transaction makes up 20% of all of your traffic and is responsible for 80% of your errors. The error profile will show the unexpected proportions in the Transaction attribute. Adjust your error profile criteria to drill down even deeper into the profile results, so you can more effectively troubleshoot and resolve specific error events.",

      "body": "With Errors in New Relic One, you can see the line of code that's causing a bad experience for your users, and get enough data to reproduce the issue so you can fix it. When you do, you’ll be able to confirm your fix is working in production. Use Errors in New Relic One to: Group and filter events to triage important errors. Get alert notifications about errors. Review stack traces, logs, and other details. Share the error information with charts and dashboards. Report new errors using instrumentation, prevent certain errors from being reported, and filter out noisy errors using expected errors. View the APM Errors page To view the Errors page: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app), then click the Error rate table's title on your selected app's Summary page. OR Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors. APM Errors UI: The Error rate chart always shows the rate for all errors, even if a filter is applied. To drill down further, use grouping and filter options for the Top 5 by count chart and Error traces table. Use the Instance dropdown to focus on a specific instance. Use the Errors workflow to identify problems Use this basic workflow to get the most out of the information you see from the Errors page. Start with the Error rate chart to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with errors in general. Correlate any general patterns on the Top 5 errors chart to alerts occurring during the same time period. Use the groups and filters to examine the error events and attributes in more detail, and look for patterns with error messages, transaction names, or other groupings. Explore and share Error trace table information, including specific stack trace details, logs, and attributes (host, URL, user, custom attributes, etc.) Also review the Error profiles page to guide your investigation into which attribute values might be correlated to the cause of errors, by comparing the frequency of those values between transactions where the error did and didn't occur (only in the old UI). Error rate chart: See patterns immediately Start with the Error rate chart to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with errors in general. For example, are there any spikes near a recent deployment? You may want to change the selected time period to look for other historical patterns. This chart always shows the overall error rate and count for the selected time period, even when you filter the rest of the page. If you want to focus your investigation on a particular type of error, use the Top 5 errors chart or the Error traces table. Top five errors: Correlate to alerts or find significant groupings Use the Top 5 errors chart to identify what error types and how many of those errors occurred during the same time period as the Error rate chart. For example: Is the error spike related to a specific exception class or transaction? Do the top errors point to a new host/container that recently got moved into production? Are the top error messages repeatedly about failed connections by hosts that you know are in a specific region of your organization? Have the chart backgrounds changed color to indicate an alert condition? (Light pink indicates the alert condition's Warning threshold, and dark pink indicates the Critical threshold.) If you want to... Do this... Change the \"top 5\" selection By default, Top 5 errors chart shows the top five errors by error class and transaction name. To group by other attributes, such as error message, host, or custom attribute, use the search bar. Explore or share error trend data The Top 5 errors chart uses error events, which include rich attribute data b default, along with any custom attributes you have added to the error event type. To examine this data in more detail, or to share it with others, select the View query or Add to dashboard links that appear when you click the chart's ... menu. Error traces: Find the line of code and data needed to reproduce the issue The Error traces table groups errors by the attributes you've selected, and links them to relevant detailed error traces. Each row helps you find answers to questions such as: How many of this transaction/class (or custom grouping) occurred within the selected time period? What is the most recent error message? When did this error first and last occur? Sometimes it may be useful to sort error trace data other than from the most to fewest occurrences. You can change the sort order or filter options to focus on just the types of errors that matter the most to you and your teams. For example: Which error has the fewest occurrences (sort on Errors column)? When did a particular error stop (sort on Last occurred)? Once you find the group of errors you want to fix, click a row in the Error traces table to drill down into the stack traces and attribute data that help pinpoint the cause. Expected errors Reduce noisy errors by marking them as “expected errors”. Such errors won't affect reported error rate or Apdex metrics. See Manage errors for more details. Expected errors aren't shown by default on the Errors page. You can show them by turning on the Show N expected errors switch below the Group by bar. Errors outside transactions Using the New Relic agent API, you can record custom errors at any point in the execution of your code. Sometimes, such custom errors will occur when a transaction is not executing, such as in high-volume aynchronous code that doesn't handle an HTTP transaction. Errors outside transactions are shown by default on the Errors page, but you can hide them by turning off the Show N errors outside transactions switch below the Group by bar. Select the time period for error data Use the time picker to examine details of error events over the past week. The error events view is available for up to a seven-day window of data collected over the last eight days. You may notice slight differences in count if your time window is set to ending now. This occurs because the counts for the list and table may be requested at slightly different times as the page auto-refreshes.",

      "body": "The thread profiler is a low-impact profiling tool that can be used in production to identify bottlenecks in an application. It works by periodically (100ms) capturing the stack trace of each thread for a specified duration. At the end of the specified duration, the stack traces are aggregated to build a tree. The call count in the tree corresponds to the number of times that function was present in the stack traces under the same context. Although the call tree cannot capture the entire execution, a large enough sample can be a good representation of the application behavior. This provides insights into the \"hot\" functions of the app where most of the time is spent. With this scope, entries sampled less than 0.05% are omitted. Supported agents This feature is available only for specific agents and versions: Java: Agent versions 1.2.004.6 or higher .NET: Framework: Agent versions 2.12.146.0 or higher .NET Core 2.0: Agent versions 8.3.360.0 or higher (Windows only) Linux: .NET Core 3.0 or higher and agent versions 8.23 or higher Python: Agent versions 1.7.0 or higher Ruby: Agent versions 3.5.5 or higher Start the profiler The thread profiler feature is enabled by default. You also may be able to turn it on or off in your agent configuration file: Java: thread_profiler.enabled NET: You cannot disable the thread profiler with .NET apps. Python: thread_profiler.enabled Ruby: thread_profiler.enabled When enabled, you can view the thread profiler from our user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Thread profiler. Select the host you want to run the profiler on. Set the duration for the profiling session. Select Start profiler. This triggers the agent to start the thread profiler during the next harvest cycle (every one minute) and capture data for the specified duration. We record thread backtraces whether or not they are in a runnable state at the time the sample is taken. Threads that are sleeping or blocked on IO may appear in the call tree. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Thread profiler: Use this page to define the settings for the thread profiler duration and to view the results. View profile data After the profiler finishes running, the agent will report the profile data. The call tree automatically appears on the Thread profiler page.

View summary information about any line in the call tree Mouse over the line. Email the thread profile results to others Select Share this profile. Start another session or view a different thread profile Select Back to all profiles. Agent considerations Depending on which agent you use, the thread profiling feature has additional considerations. .NET-specific notes When using thread profiling with the .NET Framework agent, be aware of the following. .NET agent Thread profiler notes Supported on Linux Thread profiling on Linux is supported on .NET Core 3.0 or later applications when running .NET agent version 8.23 or later. Managed threads only For .NET agents, the thread profiler only captures stack traces on managed threads. It does not capture stack traces on unmanaged threads. If a call to an unmanaged function occurs on a managed thread, the thread profiler will show Native:Function Call in the call tree. No line numbers A .NET thread profile does not include line numbers in the call tree. The Show line numbers checkbox in the Tree Settings does not have any effect. Bug with 64-bit v4.0 .NET CLR There is a bug in the 64-bit version 4.0 .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) that interferes with the agent's ability to retrieve managed stack traces. If your app experiences this bug, APM will show empty thread profiles. This bug does not affect 32-bit applications. The bug is fixed in the CLR releases for .NET 4.5. To verify whether your 64-bit application has the fixed version, look at the full version of the mscorlib.dll in the C: \\ Windows \\ Microsoft.NET \\ Framework64 \\ v4.0.30319 directory. The fix is in versions 4.0.30319.17379 or higher. Other category only All threads are put in the Other category. The Web Request and Background categories are not supported. Python-specific notes When using thread profiling with the Python agent, be aware of the following. Python agent Thread profiler notes Co-routine based systems There are limits to capturing details when a co-routine based system is being used, such as gevent or eventlet modes of gunicorn. If creating a new thread, the Python agent will actually create a greenlet instead of a thread profiler background thread. Therefore, the thread profiler will not capture any web request and background transactions on the thread profiler page. Greenlets A greenlet can run only when other greenlets explicitly yield control, such as when they block. For example, if the thread sampler does get to run, it will only sample the stack for other greenlets at a point where they are blocked. It will not sample them when they are executing arbitrary code. It can completely miss execution within a greenlet if it never blocked or otherwise yielded to another greenlet. Time in Python code Time spent in pure Python code that isn't blocking requests will not be picked up, and no information will be recorded or reported. This is because results are misleading when co-routines are used. Ruby-specific notes When using thread profiling with the Ruby agent, be aware of the following. Ruby agent Thread profiler notes Backtraces The thread profiler depends on the ability to capture thread backtraces from within your Ruby application. For this reason, it requires MRI 1.9.2 or higher (for the Thread#backtrace method). Resque The Ruby agent does not currently support thread profiles with Resque background jobs. A thread profiling session initiated against Resque will only capture traces from the parent process, not the job processes. JRuby JRuby support is considered experimental at this time. There are known issues with JRuby's Thread#backtrace implementation that will affect the accuracy of and reliability of backtraces collected under JRuby.",

      "body": "Request queuing occurs before the request reaches your application (where the agent resides). This is why you need to do some straightforward configuration of the agent and your production hosts to take advantage of this feature. HTTP header In order to report request queuing, most New Relic agents depend on an HTTP header set by the front-end web server (such as Apache or Nginx) or load balancer (such as HAProxy or F5). You can configure these front-end servers to set the timestamp in the HTTP header that represents when the request first entered your production infrastructure. Tip Set this header as soon after the request enters your infrastructure as possible so that you are less likely to miss performance problems in your infrastructure that occur before the header is set. Most New Relic agents will interpret an X-Queue-Start or X-Request-Start header and use it to calculate Request Queuing. The agents treat these headers identically. Include a value in the format t=MICROSECONDS_SINCE_EPOCH where MICROSECONDS_SINCE_EPOCH is an integer value of the number of microseconds that have elapsed since the beginning of the Unix epoch (for example, January 1, 1970). Nearly any front-end HTTP server or load balancer can be configured to add this header. Additional details depend on your specific agent and server configuration. For more information, see the request queue configuration examples. C SDK The C SDK does not support request queuing. Go agent With the Go agent, set either header to record a metric for it. Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby agents The most recent versions of the Java, Node.js, Python, and Ruby agents provide more flexibility in the format of the X-Request-Start or X-Queue-Start header. These agents allow the timestamp to be submitted in seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds as an integer or floating point value. These agents also allow the leading t= in the header value to be omitted. Based on the order of magnitude, these agents automatically interpret the time unit as seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds. New Relic can do this reliably since a millisecond timestamp, interpreted as microseconds, would result in a queue time over 40 years. Python agent only: When using Apache/mod_wsgi 3.4 or higher, mod_wsgi will automatically insert an equivalent to the X-Queue-Start header into the WSGI environ dictionary for each request. This will mark the specific point in time where Apache first accepted the request. The value set by mod_wsgi will be picked up and used by the Python agent if no separate X-Request-Start or X-Queue-Start header has been manually configured into a web server's front end or in Apache itself. .NET agent The .NET agent does not require (and will ignore) any configuration of HTTP headers to calculate queue time. It works by instrumenting the IIS-queuing mechanism directly and reports queue time as the difference between when the HttpContext constructor executes and when the HttpApplication.BeginRequest event fires. Request queue time is only reported for .NET Framework applications hosted on IIS (for example: ASP.NET applications). It is not reported for ASP .NET Core applications (targeting .NET Core or Framework), nor for self-hosted OWIN applications. PHP agent The PHP agent only supports the X-Request-Start header. This identifies the timestamp in microseconds as an integer, with an optional t= in the header value. To ensure that the header is read properly, check your phpinfo() under the PHP Variables section, and verify that _SERVER[\"HTTP_X_REQUEST_START\"] exists and is in the expected format. If you are using Nginx, see Request queue server configuration examples for additional information on setting the header.",

      "body": "In order to report request queuing, New Relic agents depend on an HTTP header set by the front-end web server (such as Apache or Nginx) or load balancer (such as HAProxy or F5). These examples use the X-Request-Start header, since it is has broader support across platforms. If this does not work with your server configuration for request queuing, try using the X-Queue-Start header. The syntax should otherwise be the same. Apache Apache's mod_headers module includes a %t variable that is formatted correctly. To enable request queue reporting, add this code to your Apache config: RequestHeader set X-Request-Start \"%t\" Copy Nginx If you are using Nginx version 1.2.6 or higher and the latest version of the Ruby, Python, or PHP agent, Nginx can easily be configured to report queue time. (For Nginx versions 1.2.6 or lower, you must recompile Nginx with a module or patch.) Configuring with Nginx 1.2.6 or higher uses the ${msec} variable, which is a number in seconds with milliseconds resolution. For more information, see http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#variables. Add the appropriate information to your Nginx config: Nginx configuration Values General Nginx use proxy_set_header X-Request-Start \"t=${msec}\"; Copy Passenger Version 5 or higher: >passenger_set_header X-REQUEST-START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy Older versions: passenger_set_cgi_param X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy fastcgi fastcgi_param HTTP_X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy uWSGI uwsgi_param HTTP_X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy F5 load balancers For F5 load balancers, use this configuration snippet: when HTTP_REQUEST_SEND { # TCL 8.4 so we have to calculate the time in millisecond resolution # Calculation from: https://groups.google.com/forum/? fromgroups=#!topic/comp.lang.tcl/tV9H6TDv0t8 set secs [clock seconds] set ms [clock clicks -milliseconds] set base [expr { $secs * 1000 }] set fract [expr { $ms - $base }] if { $fract >= 1000 } { set diff [expr { $fract / 1000 }] incr secs $diff incr fract [expr { -1000 * $diff }] } set micros [format \"%d%03d000\" $secs $fract] # Want this header inserted as if coming from the client clientside { HTTP::header insert X-Request-Start \"t=${micros}\" } } Copy Network timing Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time in your Browser data. This is because the front-end server does not add the queuing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. The queuing time headers can never account for backlog in the listener socket used to accept requests. For example, if the front-end server's configuration results in a backlog of requests that queue in the listener socket, page load timing will show an increase in network time.",

      "body": "Request queuing occurs before the request reaches your application (where the agent resides). This is why you need to do some straightforward configuration of the agent and your production hosts to take advantage of this feature. HTTP header In order to report request queuing, most New Relic agents depend on an HTTP header set by the front-end web server (such as Apache or Nginx) or load balancer (such as HAProxy or F5). You can configure these front-end servers to set the timestamp in the HTTP header that represents when the request first entered your production infrastructure. Tip Set this header as soon after the request enters your infrastructure as possible so that you are less likely to miss performance problems in your infrastructure that occur before the header is set. Most New Relic agents will interpret an X-Queue-Start or X-Request-Start header and use it to calculate Request Queuing. The agents treat these headers identically. Include a value in the format t=MICROSECONDS_SINCE_EPOCH where MICROSECONDS_SINCE_EPOCH is an integer value of the number of microseconds that have elapsed since the beginning of the Unix epoch (for example, January 1, 1970). Nearly any front-end HTTP server or load balancer can be configured to add this header. Additional details depend on your specific agent and server configuration. For more information, see the request queue configuration examples. C SDK The C SDK does not support request queuing. Go agent With the Go agent, set either header to record a metric for it. Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby agents The most recent versions of the Java, Node.js, Python, and Ruby agents provide more flexibility in the format of the X-Request-Start or X-Queue-Start header. These agents allow the timestamp to be submitted in seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds as an integer or floating point value. These agents also allow the leading t= in the header value to be omitted. Based on the order of magnitude, these agents automatically interpret the time unit as seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds. New Relic can do this reliably since a millisecond timestamp, interpreted as microseconds, would result in a queue time over 40 years. Python agent only: When using Apache/mod_wsgi 3.4 or higher, mod_wsgi will automatically insert an equivalent to the X-Queue-Start header into the WSGI environ dictionary for each request. This will mark the specific point in time where Apache first accepted the request. The value set by mod_wsgi will be picked up and used by the Python agent if no separate X-Request-Start or X-Queue-Start header has been manually configured into a web server's front end or in Apache itself. .NET agent The .NET agent does not require (and will ignore) any configuration of HTTP headers to calculate queue time. It works by instrumenting the IIS-queuing mechanism directly and reports queue time as the difference between when the HttpContext constructor executes and when the HttpApplication.BeginRequest event fires. Request queue time is only reported for .NET Framework applications hosted on IIS (for example: ASP.NET applications). It is not reported for ASP .NET Core applications (targeting .NET Core or Framework), nor for self-hosted OWIN applications. PHP agent The PHP agent only supports the X-Request-Start header. This identifies the timestamp in microseconds as an integer, with an optional t= in the header value. To ensure that the header is read properly, check your phpinfo() under the PHP Variables section, and verify that _SERVER[\"HTTP_X_REQUEST_START\"] exists and is in the expected format. If you are using Nginx, see Request queue server configuration examples for additional information on setting the header.",

      "body": "In order to report request queuing, New Relic agents depend on an HTTP header set by the front-end web server (such as Apache or Nginx) or load balancer (such as HAProxy or F5). These examples use the X-Request-Start header, since it is has broader support across platforms. If this does not work with your server configuration for request queuing, try using the X-Queue-Start header. The syntax should otherwise be the same. Apache Apache's mod_headers module includes a %t variable that is formatted correctly. To enable request queue reporting, add this code to your Apache config: RequestHeader set X-Request-Start \"%t\" Copy Nginx If you are using Nginx version 1.2.6 or higher and the latest version of the Ruby, Python, or PHP agent, Nginx can easily be configured to report queue time. (For Nginx versions 1.2.6 or lower, you must recompile Nginx with a module or patch.) Configuring with Nginx 1.2.6 or higher uses the ${msec} variable, which is a number in seconds with milliseconds resolution. For more information, see http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#variables. Add the appropriate information to your Nginx config: Nginx configuration Values General Nginx use proxy_set_header X-Request-Start \"t=${msec}\"; Copy Passenger Version 5 or higher: >passenger_set_header X-REQUEST-START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy Older versions: passenger_set_cgi_param X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy fastcgi fastcgi_param HTTP_X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy uWSGI uwsgi_param HTTP_X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy F5 load balancers For F5 load balancers, use this configuration snippet: when HTTP_REQUEST_SEND { # TCL 8.4 so we have to calculate the time in millisecond resolution # Calculation from: https://groups.google.com/forum/? fromgroups=#!topic/comp.lang.tcl/tV9H6TDv0t8 set secs [clock seconds] set ms [clock clicks -milliseconds] set base [expr { $secs * 1000 }] set fract [expr { $ms - $base }] if { $fract >= 1000 } { set diff [expr { $fract / 1000 }] incr secs $diff incr fract [expr { -1000 * $diff }] } set micros [format \"%d%03d000\" $secs $fract] # Want this header inserted as if coming from the client clientside { HTTP::header insert X-Request-Start \"t=${micros}\" } } Copy Network timing Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time in your Browser data. This is because the front-end server does not add the queuing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. The queuing time headers can never account for backlog in the listener socket used to accept requests. For example, if the front-end server's configuration results in a backlog of requests that queue in the listener socket, page load timing will show an increase in network time.",

Ruby Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slow_sql.enabled Slow query threshold: slow_sql.explain_threshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Slow SQL config options. If applicable for your application's agent language, you can also edit basic slow query settings by using server-side configuration. Slow queries metrics The slow queries list contains the following metrics: Metric Description Response time The average response time for the statements sampled. Sample count The number of slow queries identified in the sample. To view additional details, select an individual slow query: Metric Description Start time When the stack trace began collecting the data shown. Max time The maximum time for all similar query statements in the sample. Action The action or process invoking the query. Query The query that is being reported as slow. Depending on your configuration, some parts of the query may be obfuscated. Stack trace Where in the code the statement was called. For MySQL, we provide a query analysis, which explains what happened in your query and what you might do to speed it up. Other databases display an explain plan whenever possible. Troubleshooting: No slow query data If you do not see slow query data, it may be for any of these reasons: The slow query feature has been disabled. The threshold is set to too high a duration and no slow queries are being reported. The query obfuscation setting (usually record_sql or similar) may be set to Off.

      "body": "APM's Transactions page helps you identify transactions that may be good candidates for fine-tuning performance problems or resolving errors. This page lists the selected app's transaction Requests, the top five transactions by percent of wall-clock time, and relevant throughputs (requests per minute or rpm). For non-web transactions (such as message processing, background tasks, and other processes and jobs that do not handle web requests), this page shows charts of CPU and memory usage. Types of transactions Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Depending on your selected application, the Transactions page may include a dropdown you can use to select from the types of transactions available. New Relic measures processing time by type of request (web transaction or non-web transaction). This may include: Web: App server requests Non-web: Other requests (operations, background tasks, etc.) The Transactions page also may include links to transaction traces and key transactions. The types of information available will depend on your selected app and the type of request (web or non-web). Wall-clock time Wall-clock time is the amount of time recorded by the clock. New Relic uses wall-clock time for all the transactions and then sums that value across all of the transactions. The host can execute requests in parallel, so you may see percentages over 100. For example, 100% would indicate that the execution time across all selected transactions is equal to the time expended when recording wall-clock time. View transactions To view information about your app's transaction requests: Do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. If applicable: To change which available types of transactions appear, select the Type. Select the sort order, or keep the default. Select the type of view as a chart (default), histogram, or percentile, if available. To view additional details, use any of the transaction drill-down functions. To add a chart to a dashboard, mouse over the chart, then select the Add to a dashboard link that appears below it. If a chart's background is light red, this indicates a time period when an alert condition's Critical threshold has been violated. To view the incident details in New Relic Alerts, click the chart. For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. Use drill-down functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. The Transactions page has additional drill-down functions. Change the displayed transaction Type If the Type dropdown appears above list of transactions, you can select your choice of transaction type. The available types depend on what transactions your application uses. Select the type of performance measurement (Sort) The Sort dropdown above the transaction list allows you to review transactions according to different measurements. This helps you identify good candidates for performance tuning or fixing errors. You can sort by: Sort option Comments Most time consuming (default) Highest percentage of the app's total time used. This measures which transactions consumed the most time in total. This is calculated by multiplying the number of times the transaction is called by the time the transaction took to complete. A transaction could be short, but if it is frequently called, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Slowest average response time Slowest individual transactions for the time period as averaged. This measures the slowest types of transaction. A transaction could be called only a few times, but if it is one of the longest transactions to finish, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Apdex most dissatisfying Transactions with the highest percentages of user dissatisfaction levels for the response time of your web apps and services (Apdex). The dissatisfaction level is the difference between a perfect Apdex score (1.0) and your app's apdex_t (\"tolerating\") score, based on your Apdex settings. Transactions that have the highest (worst) percentages appear at the top of this ranking. Highest throughput This measures the amount of throughput, in operation requests per minute or rpm. (For web throughput, requests per minute is sometimes called pages per minute or ppm.) Transactions that have the highest number of requests per minute appear at the top of this ranking. Tip Depending on the transaction type you choose, different sort options may be available. Mouse over summary information about a transaction To quickly view key pieces of information about the transaction, mouse over its name on the list. Select detailed information about a transaction To view detailed information, select a transaction from the list, then select App performance or Historical performance. You can also view transaction traces. View transaction data in different visual formats The Transaction page's Top 5 transactions chart and a selected transaction's App performance window include options to view data as a: Chart Histogram Percentile In addition, from the Breakdown table for a selected transaction, you can select the link to show or hide all segments of the breakdown data. Show corresponding Browser request data In order to view browser information, you must enable New Relic Browser. Then, to view corresponding browser request data, use either of these options: Select the Browser drill-down link if available. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. Identify transaction segments with high call counts or time In a transaction's Breakdown table, the Avg calls (per txn) column may include colorized segment values. These indicate instrumented segments that have exceeded thresholds. Yellow: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 10. Red: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 20. Show all transactions To view all available transactions as a table, select the Show all transactions table link. From here, use any of the available options: To change the sort order, select any column header. To export the data to a file with comma-separated values, select Export as CSV. To return to the previous chart view, select Back to top transactions. CSV tables for ending now time periods are calculated at run time. They may show slightly higher values than what appears in the APM table. For each transaction, the Show all transactions table includes these measurements: Measurement Definition Apdex The average Apdex score for all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Apdex scores marked with an * asterisk indicate the agent collected fewer than 100 samples for that transaction name. Data for these transactions may be less accurate than data for transactions with higher throughput. Count The total number of all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Avg (ms) The average time taken by all transactions in the selected time range. SD (ms) The standard deviation of all timing measurements for all transactions in the selected time range. Min (ms) The time taken by the fastest transaction in the selected time range. Max (ms) The time taken by the slowest transaction in the selected time range. Total (ms) The total amount of time taken by all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Total (% time) The total amount of time for all transactions of that type, expressed as a percentage of the total amount of time taken by all transactions. Dissat (%) The percentage of the transactions that did not have satisfied Apdex scores. If you view transactions as a table, the All transactions row always contributes 100% of the app's total dissatisfaction, even if no responses are dissatisfying (100% of zero is zero).

      "body": "APM's Transactions page helps you identify transactions that may be good candidates for fine-tuning performance problems or resolving errors. This page lists the selected app's transaction Requests, the top five transactions by percent of wall-clock time, and relevant throughputs (requests per minute or rpm). For non-web transactions (such as message processing, background tasks, and other processes and jobs that do not handle web requests), this page shows charts of CPU and memory usage. Types of transactions Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Depending on your selected application, the Transactions page may include a dropdown you can use to select from the types of transactions available. New Relic measures processing time by type of request (web transaction or non-web transaction). This may include: Web: App server requests Non-web: Other requests (operations, background tasks, etc.) The Transactions page also may include links to transaction traces and key transactions. The types of information available will depend on your selected app and the type of request (web or non-web). Wall-clock time Wall-clock time is the amount of time recorded by the clock. New Relic uses wall-clock time for all the transactions and then sums that value across all of the transactions. The host can execute requests in parallel, so you may see percentages over 100. For example, 100% would indicate that the execution time across all selected transactions is equal to the time expended when recording wall-clock time. View transactions To view information about your app's transaction requests: Do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. If applicable: To change which available types of transactions appear, select the Type. Select the sort order, or keep the default. Select the type of view as a chart (default), histogram, or percentile, if available. To view additional details, use any of the transaction drill-down functions. To add a chart to a dashboard, mouse over the chart, then select the Add to a dashboard link that appears below it. If a chart's background is light red, this indicates a time period when an alert condition's Critical threshold has been violated. To view the incident details in New Relic Alerts, click the chart. For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. Use drill-down functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. The Transactions page has additional drill-down functions. Change the displayed transaction Type If the Type dropdown appears above list of transactions, you can select your choice of transaction type. The available types depend on what transactions your application uses. Select the type of performance measurement (Sort) The Sort dropdown above the transaction list allows you to review transactions according to different measurements. This helps you identify good candidates for performance tuning or fixing errors. You can sort by: Sort option Comments Most time consuming (default) Highest percentage of the app's total time used. This measures which transactions consumed the most time in total. This is calculated by multiplying the number of times the transaction is called by the time the transaction took to complete. A transaction could be short, but if it is frequently called, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Slowest average response time Slowest individual transactions for the time period as averaged. This measures the slowest types of transaction. A transaction could be called only a few times, but if it is one of the longest transactions to finish, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Apdex most dissatisfying Transactions with the highest percentages of user dissatisfaction levels for the response time of your web apps and services (Apdex). The dissatisfaction level is the difference between a perfect Apdex score (1.0) and your app's apdex_t (\"tolerating\") score, based on your Apdex settings. Transactions that have the highest (worst) percentages appear at the top of this ranking. Highest throughput This measures the amount of throughput, in operation requests per minute or rpm. (For web throughput, requests per minute is sometimes called pages per minute or ppm.) Transactions that have the highest number of requests per minute appear at the top of this ranking. Tip Depending on the transaction type you choose, different sort options may be available. Mouse over summary information about a transaction To quickly view key pieces of information about the transaction, mouse over its name on the list. Select detailed information about a transaction To view detailed information, select a transaction from the list, then select App performance or Historical performance. You can also view transaction traces. View transaction data in different visual formats The Transaction page's Top 5 transactions chart and a selected transaction's App performance window include options to view data as a: Chart Histogram Percentile In addition, from the Breakdown table for a selected transaction, you can select the link to show or hide all segments of the breakdown data. Show corresponding Browser request data In order to view browser information, you must enable New Relic Browser. Then, to view corresponding browser request data, use either of these options: Select the Browser drill-down link if available. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. Identify transaction segments with high call counts or time In a transaction's Breakdown table, the Avg calls (per txn) column may include colorized segment values. These indicate instrumented segments that have exceeded thresholds. Yellow: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 10. Red: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 20. Show all transactions To view all available transactions as a table, select the Show all transactions table link. From here, use any of the available options: To change the sort order, select any column header. To export the data to a file with comma-separated values, select Export as CSV. To return to the previous chart view, select Back to top transactions. CSV tables for ending now time periods are calculated at run time. They may show slightly higher values than what appears in the APM table. For each transaction, the Show all transactions table includes these measurements: Measurement Definition Apdex The average Apdex score for all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Apdex scores marked with an * asterisk indicate the agent collected fewer than 100 samples for that transaction name. Data for these transactions may be less accurate than data for transactions with higher throughput. Count The total number of all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Avg (ms) The average time taken by all transactions in the selected time range. SD (ms) The standard deviation of all timing measurements for all transactions in the selected time range. Min (ms) The time taken by the fastest transaction in the selected time range. Max (ms) The time taken by the slowest transaction in the selected time range. Total (ms) The total amount of time taken by all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Total (% time) The total amount of time for all transactions of that type, expressed as a percentage of the total amount of time taken by all transactions. Dissat (%) The percentage of the transactions that did not have satisfied Apdex scores. If you view transactions as a table, the All transactions row always contributes 100% of the app's total dissatisfaction, even if no responses are dissatisfying (100% of zero is zero). In this situation, 100% does not mean that all of your transactions are dissatisfying. The sum of all the other values in the Dissat (%) column is 100%. Additional functions Here are some additional functions for the Transactions page's selected transaction. If you want to... Do this... View transactions for operations and other background tasks Change the Type to Other transactions (or a specific type listed), then select a specific transaction. The Transactions page shows the top five transactions for this selection by wall-clock time, CPU usage, and memory usage.

      "body": "APM's Transactions page helps you identify transactions that may be good candidates for fine-tuning performance problems or resolving errors. This page lists the selected app's transaction Requests, the top five transactions by percent of wall-clock time, and relevant throughputs (requests per minute or rpm). For non-web transactions (such as message processing, background tasks, and other processes and jobs that do not handle web requests), this page shows charts of CPU and memory usage. Types of transactions Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Depending on your selected application, the Transactions page may include a dropdown you can use to select from the types of transactions available. New Relic measures processing time by type of request (web transaction or non-web transaction). This may include: Web: App server requests Non-web: Other requests (operations, background tasks, etc.) The Transactions page also may include links to transaction traces and key transactions. The types of information available will depend on your selected app and the type of request (web or non-web). Wall-clock time Wall-clock time is the amount of time recorded by the clock. New Relic uses wall-clock time for all the transactions and then sums that value across all of the transactions. The host can execute requests in parallel, so you may see percentages over 100. For example, 100% would indicate that the execution time across all selected transactions is equal to the time expended when recording wall-clock time. View transactions To view information about your app's transaction requests: Do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. If applicable: To change which available types of transactions appear, select the Type. Select the sort order, or keep the default. Select the type of view as a chart (default), histogram, or percentile, if available. To view additional details, use any of the transaction drill-down functions. To add a chart to a dashboard, mouse over the chart, then select the Add to a dashboard link that appears below it. If a chart's background is light red, this indicates a time period when an alert condition's Critical threshold has been violated. To view the incident details in New Relic Alerts, click the chart. For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. Use drill-down functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. The Transactions page has additional drill-down functions. Change the displayed transaction Type If the Type dropdown appears above list of transactions, you can select your choice of transaction type. The available types depend on what transactions your application uses. Select the type of performance measurement (Sort) The Sort dropdown above the transaction list allows you to review transactions according to different measurements. This helps you identify good candidates for performance tuning or fixing errors. You can sort by: Sort option Comments Most time consuming (default) Highest percentage of the app's total time used. This measures which transactions consumed the most time in total. This is calculated by multiplying the number of times the transaction is called by the time the transaction took to complete. A transaction could be short, but if it is frequently called, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Slowest average response time Slowest individual transactions for the time period as averaged. This measures the slowest types of transaction. A transaction could be called only a few times, but if it is one of the longest transactions to finish, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Apdex most dissatisfying Transactions with the highest percentages of user dissatisfaction levels for the response time of your web apps and services (Apdex). The dissatisfaction level is the difference between a perfect Apdex score (1.0) and your app's apdex_t (\"tolerating\") score, based on your Apdex settings. Transactions that have the highest (worst) percentages appear at the top of this ranking. Highest throughput This measures the amount of throughput, in operation requests per minute or rpm. (For web throughput, requests per minute is sometimes called pages per minute or ppm.) Transactions that have the highest number of requests per minute appear at the top of this ranking. Tip Depending on the transaction type you choose, different sort options may be available. Mouse over summary information about a transaction To quickly view key pieces of information about the transaction, mouse over its name on the list. Select detailed information about a transaction To view detailed information, select a transaction from the list, then select App performance or Historical performance. You can also view transaction traces. View transaction data in different visual formats The Transaction page's Top 5 transactions chart and a selected transaction's App performance window include options to view data as a: Chart Histogram Percentile In addition, from the Breakdown table for a selected transaction, you can select the link to show or hide all segments of the breakdown data. Show corresponding Browser request data In order to view browser information, you must enable New Relic Browser. Then, to view corresponding browser request data, use either of these options: Select the Browser drill-down link if available. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. Identify transaction segments with high call counts or time In a transaction's Breakdown table, the Avg calls (per txn) column may include colorized segment values. These indicate instrumented segments that have exceeded thresholds. Yellow: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 10. Red: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 20. Show all transactions To view all available transactions as a table, select the Show all transactions table link. From here, use any of the available options: To change the sort order, select any column header. To export the data to a file with comma-separated values, select Export as CSV. To return to the previous chart view, select Back to top transactions. CSV tables for ending now time periods are calculated at run time. They may show slightly higher values than what appears in the APM table. For each transaction, the Show all transactions table includes these measurements: Measurement Definition Apdex The average Apdex score for all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Apdex scores marked with an * asterisk indicate the agent collected fewer than 100 samples for that transaction name. Data for these transactions may be less accurate than data for transactions with higher throughput. Count The total number of all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Avg (ms) The average time taken by all transactions in the selected time range. SD (ms) The standard deviation of all timing measurements for all transactions in the selected time range. Min (ms) The time taken by the fastest transaction in the selected time range. Max (ms) The time taken by the slowest transaction in the selected time range. Total (ms) The total amount of time taken by all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Total (% time) The total amount of time for all transactions of that type, expressed as a percentage of the total amount of time taken by all transactions. Dissat (%) The percentage of the transactions that did not have satisfied Apdex scores. If you view transactions as a table, the All transactions row always contributes 100% of the app's total dissatisfaction, even if no responses are dissatisfying (100% of zero is zero). In this situation, 100% does not mean that all of your transactions are dissatisfying. The sum of all the other values in the Dissat (%) column is 100%. Additional functions Here are some additional functions for the Transactions page's selected transaction. If you want to... Do this... View transactions for operations and other background tasks Change the Type to Other transactions (or a specific type listed), then select a specific transaction. The Transactions page shows the top five transactions for this selection by wall-clock time, CPU usage, and memory usage. Track a transaction that is important to your business Select the transaction's name, then select Track as key transaction. View transaction trace details A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction. From the Transactions page, select the transaction trace. Select the view for Summary, Trace details, or Database queries, if available. To expand the transaction trace to full screen view, select the full screen icon. To return to the Transactions page: Next to the transaction trace's name, select the back arrow. Add or view transaction segments To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To view the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. View reports You can also use the Web transactions analysis report for web transactions and the Background jobs analysis report for non-web transactions to compare the amount of time spent in throughput, total time in the transaction, average time to execute it, and Apdex score as applicable. Delete all transaction traces Caution If you select Delete all traces, you cannot recover them.",

Let's look at what slow query data is, where to find it, and how to configure it. Slow query data samples When transaction traces are reported, the slow queries feature samples the slowest database queries in those traces and reports data about them on the Databases page. Slow query data can include: Duration of query segments Query/explain plans (if recognized) Host and instance level details (if supported by agent) View slow query data Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. To see your slow query data: Do one of the following: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Databases. APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Databases. Select a database transaction. If available, select any available slow queries listed on the page. If you do not see expected slow query data, follow the troubleshooting tips. Configuration In general, you can configure your slow query settings either of these ways: Agent configuration Server-side configuration (if available for your agent) Agent configuration gives you more options than server-side configuration does. How you choose to configure slow queries will depend on your own setup and preferences. For more information, see the documentation for the specific agent: C SDK You can report slow query traces for SQL databases only. For more information, see Instrument your application with the C SDK. Go Agent configuration options: Enable/disable: SlowQuery.Enabled Slow query threshold: SlowQuery.Threshold For other datastore config options, see Datastore tracer configuration. Java Agent configuration: Slow query threshold: explain_threshold. For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options. You can also edit basic slow query settings via server-side configuration. .NET Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slowSql enabled Slow query threshold: explainThreshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Datastore tracer options. You can also edit basic slow query settings via server-side configuration. Node.js Agent configuration: Enable/disable: enabled Threshold: explain_threshold Maximum slow query samples: max_samples For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options. Server-side configuration of slow query data is not possible for the Node.js agent. PHP Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slow_sql Threshold: explain_threshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options. Server-side configuration is not possible for the PHP agent. Python Agent configuration: Slow query threshold: explain_threshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Datastore tracer options. You can also edit basic slow query settings via server-side configuration. Ruby Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slow_sql.enabled Slow query threshold: slow_sql.explain_threshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Slow SQL config options. If applicable for your application's agent language, you can also edit basic slow query settings by using server-side configuration. Slow queries metrics The slow queries list contains the following metrics: Metric Description Response time The average response time for the statements sampled. Sample count The number of slow queries identified in the sample. To view additional details, select an individual slow query: Metric Description Start time When the stack trace began collecting the data shown. Max time The maximum time for all similar query statements in the sample. Action The action or process invoking the query. Query The query that is being reported as slow. Depending on your configuration, some parts of the query may be obfuscated. Stack trace Where in the code the statement was called. For MySQL, we provide a query analysis, which explains what happened in your query and what you might do to speed it up. Other databases display an explain plan whenever possible. Troubleshooting: No slow query data If you do not see slow query data, it may be for any of these reasons: The slow query feature has been disabled. The threshold is set to too high a duration and no slow queries are being reported. The query obfuscation setting (usually record_sql or similar) may be set to Off. To solve the problem, try adjusting the configuration options.",

Slowest average response time Slowest individual transactions for the time period as averaged. This measures the slowest types of transaction. A transaction could be called only a few times, but if it is one of the longest transactions to finish, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Apdex most dissatisfying Transactions with the highest percentages of user dissatisfaction levels for the response time of your web apps and services (Apdex). The dissatisfaction level is the difference between a perfect Apdex score (1.0) and your app's apdex_t (\"tolerating\") score, based on your Apdex settings. Transactions that have the highest (worst) percentages appear at the top of this ranking. Highest throughput This measures the amount of throughput, in operation requests per minute or rpm. (For web throughput, requests per minute is sometimes called pages per minute or ppm.) Transactions that have the highest number of requests per minute appear at the top of this ranking. Tip Depending on the transaction type you choose, different sort options may be available. Mouse over summary information about a transaction To quickly view key pieces of information about the transaction, mouse over its name on the list. Select detailed information about a transaction To view detailed information, select a transaction from the list, then select App performance or Historical performance. You can also view transaction traces. View transaction data in different visual formats The Transaction page's Top 5 transactions chart and a selected transaction's App performance window include options to view data as a: Chart Histogram Percentile In addition, from the Breakdown table for a selected transaction, you can select the link to show or hide all segments of the breakdown data. Show corresponding Browser request data In order to view browser information, you must enable New Relic Browser. Then, to view corresponding browser request data, use either of these options: Select the Browser drill-down link if available. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. Identify transaction segments with high call counts or time In a transaction's Breakdown table, the Avg calls (per txn) column may include colorized segment values. These indicate instrumented segments that have exceeded thresholds. Yellow: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 10. Red: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 20. Show all transactions To view all available transactions as a table, select the Show all transactions table link. From here, use any of the available options: To change the sort order, select any column header. To export the data to a file with comma-separated values, select Export as CSV. To return to the previous chart view, select Back to top transactions. CSV tables for ending now time periods are calculated at run time. They may show slightly higher values than what appears in the APM table. For each transaction, the Show all transactions table includes these measurements: Measurement Definition Apdex The average Apdex score for all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Apdex scores marked with an * asterisk indicate the agent collected fewer than 100 samples for that transaction name. Data for these transactions may be less accurate than data for transactions with higher throughput. Count The total number of all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Avg (ms) The average time taken by all transactions in the selected time range. SD (ms) The standard deviation of all timing measurements for all transactions in the selected time range. Min (ms) The time taken by the fastest transaction in the selected time range. Max (ms) The time taken by the slowest transaction in the selected time range. Total (ms) The total amount of time taken by all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Total (% time) The total amount of time for all transactions of that type, expressed as a percentage of the total amount of time taken by all transactions. Dissat (%) The percentage of the transactions that did not have satisfied Apdex scores. If you view transactions as a table, the All transactions row always contributes 100% of the app's total dissatisfaction, even if no responses are dissatisfying (100% of zero is zero). In this situation, 100% does not mean that all of your transactions are dissatisfying. The sum of all the other values in the Dissat (%) column is 100%. Additional functions Here are some additional functions for the Transactions page's selected transaction. If you want to... Do this... View transactions for operations and other background tasks Change the Type to Other transactions (or a specific type listed), then select a specific transaction. The Transactions page shows the top five transactions for this selection by wall-clock time, CPU usage, and memory usage. Track a transaction that is important to your business Select the transaction's name, then select Track as key transaction. View transaction trace details A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction. From the Transactions page, select the transaction trace. Select the view for Summary, Trace details, or Database queries, if available. To expand the transaction trace to full screen view, select the full screen icon. To return to the Transactions page: Next to the transaction trace's name, select the back arrow. Add or view transaction segments To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To view the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. View reports You can also use the Web transactions analysis report for web transactions and the Background jobs analysis report for non-web transactions to compare the amount of time spent in throughput, total time in the transaction, average time to execute it, and Apdex score as applicable.

Let's look at what slow query data is, where to find it, and how to configure it. Slow query data samples When transaction traces are reported, the slow queries feature samples the slowest database queries in those traces and reports data about them on the Databases page. Slow query data can include: Duration of query segments Query/explain plans (if recognized) Host and instance level details (if supported by agent) View slow query data Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. To see your slow query data: Do one of the following: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Databases. APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Databases. Select a database transaction. If available, select any available slow queries listed on the page. If you do not see expected slow query data, follow the troubleshooting tips. Configuration In general, you can configure your slow query settings either of these ways: Agent configuration Server-side configuration (if available for your agent) Agent configuration gives you more options than server-side configuration does. How you choose to configure slow queries will depend on your own setup and preferences. For more information, see the documentation for the specific agent: C SDK You can report slow query traces for SQL databases only. For more information, see Instrument your application with the C SDK. Go Agent configuration options: Enable/disable: SlowQuery.Enabled Slow query threshold: SlowQuery.Threshold For other datastore config options, see Datastore tracer configuration. Java Agent configuration: Slow query threshold: explain_threshold. For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options. You can also edit basic slow query settings via server-side configuration. .NET Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slowSql enabled Slow query threshold: explainThreshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Datastore tracer options. You can also edit basic slow query settings via server-side configuration. Node.js Agent configuration: Enable/disable: enabled Threshold: explain_threshold Maximum slow query samples: max_samples For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options. Server-side configuration of slow query data is not possible for the Node.js agent. PHP Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slow_sql Threshold: explain_threshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options. Server-side configuration is not possible for the PHP agent. Python Agent configuration: Slow query threshold: explain_threshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Datastore tracer options. You can also edit basic slow query settings via server-side configuration. Ruby Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slow_sql.enabled Slow query threshold: slow_sql.explain_threshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Slow SQL config options. If applicable for your application's agent language, you can also edit basic slow query settings by using server-side configuration. Slow queries metrics The slow queries list contains the following metrics: Metric Description Response time The average response time for the statements sampled. Sample count The number of slow queries identified in the sample. To view additional details, select an individual slow query: Metric Description Start time When the stack trace began collecting the data shown. Max time The maximum time for all similar query statements in the sample. Action The action or process invoking the query. Query The query that is being reported as slow. Depending on your configuration, some parts of the query may be obfuscated. Stack trace Where in the code the statement was called. For MySQL, we provide a query analysis, which explains what happened in your query and what you might do to speed it up. Other databases display an explain plan whenever possible. Troubleshooting: No slow query data If you do not see slow query data, it may be for any of these reasons: The slow query feature has been disabled. The threshold is set to too high a duration and no slow queries are being reported. The query obfuscation setting (usually record_sql or similar) may be set to Off. To solve the problem, try adjusting the configuration options.",

      "body": "APM's Transactions page helps you identify transactions that may be good candidates for fine-tuning performance problems or resolving errors. This page lists the selected app's transaction Requests, the top five transactions by percent of wall-clock time, and relevant throughputs (requests per minute or rpm). For non-web transactions (such as message processing, background tasks, and other processes and jobs that do not handle web requests), this page shows charts of CPU and memory usage. Types of transactions Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Depending on your selected application, the Transactions page may include a dropdown you can use to select from the types of transactions available. New Relic measures processing time by type of request (web transaction or non-web transaction). This may include: Web: App server requests Non-web: Other requests (operations, background tasks, etc.) The Transactions page also may include links to transaction traces and key transactions. The types of information available will depend on your selected app and the type of request (web or non-web). Wall-clock time Wall-clock time is the amount of time recorded by the clock. New Relic uses wall-clock time for all the transactions and then sums that value across all of the transactions. The host can execute requests in parallel, so you may see percentages over 100. For example, 100% would indicate that the execution time across all selected transactions is equal to the time expended when recording wall-clock time. View transactions To view information about your app's transaction requests: Do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. If applicable: To change which available types of transactions appear, select the Type. Select the sort order, or keep the default. Select the type of view as a chart (default), histogram, or percentile, if available. To view additional details, use any of the transaction drill-down functions. To add a chart to a dashboard, mouse over the chart, then select the Add to a dashboard link that appears below it. If a chart's background is light red, this indicates a time period when an alert condition's Critical threshold has been violated. To view the incident details in New Relic Alerts, click the chart. For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. Use drill-down functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. The Transactions page has additional drill-down functions. Change the displayed transaction Type If the Type dropdown appears above list of transactions, you can select your choice of transaction type. The available types depend on what transactions your application uses. Select the type of performance measurement (Sort) The Sort dropdown above the transaction list allows you to review transactions according to different measurements. This helps you identify good candidates for performance tuning or fixing errors. You can sort by: Sort option Comments Most time consuming (default) Highest percentage of the app's total time used. This measures which transactions consumed the most time in total. This is calculated by multiplying the number of times the transaction is called by the time the transaction took to complete. A transaction could be short, but if it is frequently called, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Slowest average response time Slowest individual transactions for the time period as averaged. This measures the slowest types of transaction. A transaction could be called only a few times, but if it is one of the longest transactions to finish, it would appear at the top of this ranking.

If you do not see expected slow query data, follow the troubleshooting tips. Configuration In general, you can configure your slow query settings either of these ways: Agent configuration Server-side configuration (if available for your agent) Agent configuration gives you more options than server-side configuration does. How you choose to configure slow queries will depend on your own setup and preferences. For more information, see the documentation for the specific agent: C SDK You can report slow query traces for SQL databases only. For more information, see Instrument your application with the C SDK. Go Agent configuration options: Enable/disable: SlowQuery.Enabled Slow query threshold: SlowQuery.Threshold For other datastore config options, see Datastore tracer configuration. Java Agent configuration: Slow query threshold: explain_threshold. For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options. You can also edit basic slow query settings via server-side configuration. .NET Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slowSql enabled Slow query threshold: explainThreshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Datastore tracer options. You can also edit basic slow query settings via server-side configuration. Node.js Agent configuration: Enable/disable: enabled Threshold: explain_threshold Maximum slow query samples: max_samples For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options. Server-side configuration of slow query data is not possible for the Node.js agent. PHP Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slow_sql Threshold: explain_threshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options. Server-side configuration is not possible for the PHP agent. Python Agent configuration: Slow query threshold: explain_threshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Datastore tracer options. You can also edit basic slow query settings via server-side configuration. Ruby Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slow_sql.enabled Slow query threshold: slow_sql.explain_threshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Slow SQL config options. If applicable for your application's agent language, you can also edit basic slow query settings by using server-side configuration. Slow queries metrics The slow queries list contains the following metrics: Metric Description Response time The average response time for the statements sampled. Sample count The number of slow queries identified in the sample. To view additional details, select an individual slow query: Metric Description Start time When the stack trace began collecting the data shown. Max time The maximum time for all similar query statements in the sample. Action The action or process invoking the query. Query The query that is being reported as slow. Depending on your configuration, some parts of the query may be obfuscated. Stack trace Where in the code the statement was called. For MySQL, we provide a query analysis, which explains what happened in your query and what you might do to speed it up. Other databases display an explain plan whenever possible. Troubleshooting: No slow query data If you do not see slow query data, it may be for any of these reasons: The slow query feature has been disabled. The threshold is set to too high a duration and no slow queries are being reported. The query obfuscation setting (usually record_sql or similar) may be set to Off. To solve the problem, try adjusting the configuration options.",

      "body": "APM's Transactions page helps you identify transactions that may be good candidates for fine-tuning performance problems or resolving errors. This page lists the selected app's transaction Requests, the top five transactions by percent of wall-clock time, and relevant throughputs (requests per minute or rpm). For non-web transactions (such as message processing, background tasks, and other processes and jobs that do not handle web requests), this page shows charts of CPU and memory usage. Types of transactions Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Depending on your selected application, the Transactions page may include a dropdown you can use to select from the types of transactions available. New Relic measures processing time by type of request (web transaction or non-web transaction). This may include: Web: App server requests Non-web: Other requests (operations, background tasks, etc.) The Transactions page also may include links to transaction traces and key transactions. The types of information available will depend on your selected app and the type of request (web or non-web). Wall-clock time Wall-clock time is the amount of time recorded by the clock. New Relic uses wall-clock time for all the transactions and then sums that value across all of the transactions. The host can execute requests in parallel, so you may see percentages over 100. For example, 100% would indicate that the execution time across all selected transactions is equal to the time expended when recording wall-clock time. View transactions To view information about your app's transaction requests: Do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. If applicable: To change which available types of transactions appear, select the Type. Select the sort order, or keep the default. Select the type of view as a chart (default), histogram, or percentile, if available. To view additional details, use any of the transaction drill-down functions. To add a chart to a dashboard, mouse over the chart, then select the Add to a dashboard link that appears below it. If a chart's background is light red, this indicates a time period when an alert condition's Critical threshold has been violated. To view the incident details in New Relic Alerts, click the chart. For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. Use drill-down functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. The Transactions page has additional drill-down functions. Change the displayed transaction Type If the Type dropdown appears above list of transactions, you can select your choice of transaction type. The available types depend on what transactions your application uses. Select the type of performance measurement (Sort) The Sort dropdown above the transaction list allows you to review transactions according to different measurements. This helps you identify good candidates for performance tuning or fixing errors. You can sort by: Sort option Comments Most time consuming (default) Highest percentage of the app's total time used. This measures which transactions consumed the most time in total. This is calculated by multiplying the number of times the transaction is called by the time the transaction took to complete. A transaction could be short, but if it is frequently called, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Slowest average response time Slowest individual transactions for the time period as averaged. This measures the slowest types of transaction. A transaction could be called only a few times, but if it is one of the longest transactions to finish, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Apdex most dissatisfying Transactions with the highest percentages of user dissatisfaction levels for the response time of your web apps and services (Apdex). The dissatisfaction level is the difference between a perfect Apdex score (1.0) and your app's apdex_t (\"tolerating\") score, based on your Apdex settings. Transactions that have the highest (worst) percentages appear at the top of this ranking. Highest throughput This measures the amount of throughput, in operation requests per minute or rpm. (For web throughput, requests per minute is sometimes called pages per minute or ppm.) Transactions that have the highest number of requests per minute appear at the top of this ranking. Tip Depending on the transaction type you choose, different sort options may be available. Mouse over summary information about a transaction To quickly view key pieces of information about the transaction, mouse over its name on the list. Select detailed information about a transaction To view detailed information, select a transaction from the list, then select App performance or Historical performance. You can also view transaction traces. View transaction data in different visual formats The Transaction page's Top 5 transactions chart and a selected transaction's App performance window include options to view data as a: Chart Histogram Percentile In addition, from the Breakdown table for a selected transaction, you can select the link to show or hide all segments of the breakdown data. Show corresponding Browser request data In order to view browser information, you must enable New Relic Browser. Then, to view corresponding browser request data, use either of these options: Select the Browser drill-down link if available. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. Identify transaction segments with high call counts or time In a transaction's Breakdown table, the Avg calls (per txn) column may include colorized segment values. These indicate instrumented segments that have exceeded thresholds. Yellow: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 10. Red: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 20. Show all transactions To view all available transactions as a table, select the Show all transactions table link. From here, use any of the available options: To change the sort order, select any column header. To export the data to a file with comma-separated values, select Export as CSV. To return to the previous chart view, select Back to top transactions. CSV tables for ending now time periods are calculated at run time. They may show slightly higher values than what appears in the APM table. For each transaction, the Show all transactions table includes these measurements: Measurement Definition Apdex The average Apdex score for all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Apdex scores marked with an * asterisk indicate the agent collected fewer than 100 samples for that transaction name. Data for these transactions may be less accurate than data for transactions with higher throughput. Count The total number of all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Avg (ms) The average time taken by all transactions in the selected time range. SD (ms) The standard deviation of all timing measurements for all transactions in the selected time range. Min (ms) The time taken by the fastest transaction in the selected time range. Max (ms) The time taken by the slowest transaction in the selected time range. Total (ms) The total amount of time taken by all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Total (% time) The total amount of time for all transactions of that type, expressed as a percentage of the total amount of time taken by all transactions. Dissat (%) The percentage of the transactions that did not have satisfied Apdex scores. If you view transactions as a table, the All transactions row always contributes 100% of the app's total dissatisfaction, even if no responses are dissatisfying (100% of zero is zero). In this situation, 100% does not mean that all of your transactions are dissatisfying. The sum of all the other values in the Dissat (%) column is 100%. Additional functions Here are some additional functions for the Transactions page's selected transaction. If you want to... Do this... View transactions for operations and other background tasks Change the Type to Other transactions (or a specific type listed), then select a specific transaction. The Transactions page shows the top five transactions for this selection by wall-clock time, CPU usage, and memory usage. Track a transaction that is important to your business Select the transaction's name, then select Track as key transaction. View transaction trace details A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction. From the Transactions page, select the transaction trace. Select the view for Summary, Trace details, or Database queries, if available. To expand the transaction trace to full screen view, select the full screen icon. To return to the Transactions page: Next to the transaction trace's name, select the back arrow. Add or view transaction segments To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To view the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. View reports You can also use the Web transactions analysis report for web transactions and the Background jobs analysis report for non-web transactions to compare the amount of time spent in throughput, total time in the transaction, average time to execute it, and Apdex score as applicable. Delete all transaction traces Caution If you select Delete all traces, you cannot recover them.",

      "body": "In APM, when transaction traces are collected, there may be additional Slow query data available on the Databases page. Let's look at what slow query data is, where to find it, and how to configure it. Slow query data samples When transaction traces are reported, the slow queries feature samples the slowest database queries in those traces and reports data about them on the Databases page. Slow query data can include: Duration of query segments Query/explain plans (if recognized) Host and instance level details (if supported by agent) View slow query data Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. To see your slow query data: Do one of the following: New Relic Explorer: Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Databases. APM: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Databases. Select a database transaction. If available, select any available slow queries listed on the page. If you do not see expected slow query data, follow the troubleshooting tips. Configuration In general, you can configure your slow query settings either of these ways: Agent configuration Server-side configuration (if available for your agent) Agent configuration gives you more options than server-side configuration does. How you choose to configure slow queries will depend on your own setup and preferences. For more information, see the documentation for the specific agent: C SDK You can report slow query traces for SQL databases only. For more information, see Instrument your application with the C SDK. Go Agent configuration options: Enable/disable: SlowQuery.Enabled Slow query threshold: SlowQuery.Threshold For other datastore config options, see Datastore tracer configuration. Java Agent configuration: Slow query threshold: explain_threshold. For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options. You can also edit basic slow query settings via server-side configuration. .NET Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slowSql enabled Slow query threshold: explainThreshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Datastore tracer options. You can also edit basic slow query settings via server-side configuration. Node.js Agent configuration: Enable/disable: enabled Threshold: explain_threshold Maximum slow query samples: max_samples For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options. Server-side configuration of slow query data is not possible for the Node.js agent. PHP Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slow_sql Threshold: explain_threshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options. Server-side configuration is not possible for the PHP agent. Python Agent configuration: Slow query threshold: explain_threshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Datastore tracer options. You can also edit basic slow query settings via server-side configuration. Ruby Agent configuration: Enable/disable: slow_sql.enabled Slow query threshold: slow_sql.explain_threshold For other settings related to slow transactions and queries, see the Transaction tracer config options and the Slow SQL config options. If applicable for your application's agent language, you can also edit basic slow query settings by using server-side configuration. Slow queries metrics The slow queries list contains the following metrics: Metric Description Response time The average response time for the statements sampled. Sample count The number of slow queries identified in the sample. To view additional details, select an individual slow query: Metric Description Start time When the stack trace began collecting the data shown. Max time The maximum time for all similar query statements in the sample. Action The action or process invoking the query. Query The query that is being reported as slow. Depending on your configuration, some parts of the query may be obfuscated. Stack trace Where in the code the statement was called. For MySQL, we provide a query analysis, which explains what happened in your query and what you might do to speed it up. Other databases display an explain plan whenever possible. Troubleshooting: No slow query data If you do not see slow query data, it may be for any of these reasons: The slow query feature has been disabled. The threshold is set to too high a duration and no slow queries are being reported. The query obfuscation setting (usually record_sql or similar) may be set to Off. To solve the problem, try adjusting the configuration options.",

      "body": "APM's Transactions page helps you identify transactions that may be good candidates for fine-tuning performance problems or resolving errors. This page lists the selected app's transaction Requests, the top five transactions by percent of wall-clock time, and relevant throughputs (requests per minute or rpm). For non-web transactions (such as message processing, background tasks, and other processes and jobs that do not handle web requests), this page shows charts of CPU and memory usage. Types of transactions Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. Depending on your selected application, the Transactions page may include a dropdown you can use to select from the types of transactions available. New Relic measures processing time by type of request (web transaction or non-web transaction). This may include: Web: App server requests Non-web: Other requests (operations, background tasks, etc.) The Transactions page also may include links to transaction traces and key transactions. The types of information available will depend on your selected app and the type of request (web or non-web). Wall-clock time Wall-clock time is the amount of time recorded by the clock. New Relic uses wall-clock time for all the transactions and then sums that value across all of the transactions. The host can execute requests in parallel, so you may see percentages over 100. For example, 100% would indicate that the execution time across all selected transactions is equal to the time expended when recording wall-clock time. View transactions To view information about your app's transaction requests: Do one of the following: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. Go to one.newrelic.com > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions. If applicable: To change which available types of transactions appear, select the Type. Select the sort order, or keep the default. Select the type of view as a chart (default), histogram, or percentile, if available. To view additional details, use any of the transaction drill-down functions. To add a chart to a dashboard, mouse over the chart, then select the Add to a dashboard link that appears below it. If a chart's background is light red, this indicates a time period when an alert condition's Critical threshold has been violated. To view the incident details in New Relic Alerts, click the chart. For more information, see the documentation about navigating core UI components in New Relic One. Use drill-down functions Use any of New Relic's standard user interface functions to drill down into detailed information. The Transactions page has additional drill-down functions. Change the displayed transaction Type If the Type dropdown appears above list of transactions, you can select your choice of transaction type. The available types depend on what transactions your application uses. Select the type of performance measurement (Sort) The Sort dropdown above the transaction list allows you to review transactions according to different measurements. This helps you identify good candidates for performance tuning or fixing errors. You can sort by: Sort option Comments Most time consuming (default) Highest percentage of the app's total time used. This measures which transactions consumed the most time in total. This is calculated by multiplying the number of times the transaction is called by the time the transaction took to complete. A transaction could be short, but if it is frequently called, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Slowest average response time Slowest individual transactions for the time period as averaged. This measures the slowest types of transaction. A transaction could be called only a few times, but if it is one of the longest transactions to finish, it would appear at the top of this ranking. Apdex most dissatisfying Transactions with the highest percentages of user dissatisfaction levels for the response time of your web apps and services (Apdex). The dissatisfaction level is the difference between a perfect Apdex score (1.0) and your app's apdex_t (\"tolerating\") score, based on your Apdex settings. Transactions that have the highest (worst) percentages appear at the top of this ranking. Highest throughput This measures the amount of throughput, in operation requests per minute or rpm. (For web throughput, requests per minute is sometimes called pages per minute or ppm.) Transactions that have the highest number of requests per minute appear at the top of this ranking. Tip Depending on the transaction type you choose, different sort options may be available. Mouse over summary information about a transaction To quickly view key pieces of information about the transaction, mouse over its name on the list. Select detailed information about a transaction To view detailed information, select a transaction from the list, then select App performance or Historical performance. You can also view transaction traces. View transaction data in different visual formats The Transaction page's Top 5 transactions chart and a selected transaction's App performance window include options to view data as a: Chart Histogram Percentile In addition, from the Breakdown table for a selected transaction, you can select the link to show or hide all segments of the breakdown data. Show corresponding Browser request data In order to view browser information, you must enable New Relic Browser. Then, to view corresponding browser request data, use either of these options: Select the Browser drill-down link if available. Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. Identify transaction segments with high call counts or time In a transaction's Breakdown table, the Avg calls (per txn) column may include colorized segment values. These indicate instrumented segments that have exceeded thresholds. Yellow: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 10. Red: Segment time is more than 10% of total transaction time and call count is higher than 20. Show all transactions To view all available transactions as a table, select the Show all transactions table link. From here, use any of the available options: To change the sort order, select any column header. To export the data to a file with comma-separated values, select Export as CSV. To return to the previous chart view, select Back to top transactions. CSV tables for ending now time periods are calculated at run time. They may show slightly higher values than what appears in the APM table. For each transaction, the Show all transactions table includes these measurements: Measurement Definition Apdex The average Apdex score for all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Apdex scores marked with an * asterisk indicate the agent collected fewer than 100 samples for that transaction name. Data for these transactions may be less accurate than data for transactions with higher throughput. Count The total number of all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Avg (ms) The average time taken by all transactions in the selected time range. SD (ms) The standard deviation of all timing measurements for all transactions in the selected time range. Min (ms) The time taken by the fastest transaction in the selected time range. Max (ms) The time taken by the slowest transaction in the selected time range. Total (ms) The total amount of time taken by all transactions that occurred in the selected time range. Total (% time) The total amount of time for all transactions of that type, expressed as a percentage of the total amount of time taken by all transactions. Dissat (%) The percentage of the transactions that did not have satisfied Apdex scores. If you view transactions as a table, the All transactions row always contributes 100% of the app's total dissatisfaction, even if no responses are dissatisfying (100% of zero is zero). In this situation, 100% does not mean that all of your transactions are dissatisfying. The sum of all the other values in the Dissat (%) column is 100%. Additional functions Here are some additional functions for the Transactions page's selected transaction. If you want to... Do this... View transactions for operations and other background tasks Change the Type to Other transactions (or a specific type listed), then select a specific transaction. The Transactions page shows the top five transactions for this selection by wall-clock time, CPU usage, and memory usage. Track a transaction that is important to your business Select the transaction's name, then select Track as key transaction. View transaction trace details A transaction trace is a complete picture of a single transaction. From the Transactions page, select the transaction trace. Select the view for Summary, Trace details, or Database queries, if available. To expand the transaction trace to full screen view, select the full screen icon. To return to the Transactions page: Next to the transaction trace's name, select the back arrow. Add or view transaction segments To add segments to a transaction, use custom instrumentation. To view the segments of a specific transaction, use transaction traces. View reports You can also use the Web transactions analysis report for web transactions and the Background jobs analysis report for non-web transactions to compare the amount of time spent in throughput, total time in the transaction, average time to execute it, and Apdex score as applicable. Delete all transaction traces Caution If you select Delete all traces, you cannot recover them.",

      "body": "The thread profiler is a low-impact profiling tool that can be used in production to identify bottlenecks in an application. It works by periodically (100ms) capturing the stack trace of each thread for a specified duration. At the end of the specified duration, the stack traces are aggregated to build a tree. The call count in the tree corresponds to the number of times that function was present in the stack traces under the same context. Although the call tree cannot capture the entire execution, a large enough sample can be a good representation of the application behavior. This provides insights into the \"hot\" functions of the app where most of the time is spent. With this scope, entries sampled less than 0.05% are omitted. Supported agents This feature is available only for specific agents and versions: Java: Agent versions 1.2.004.6 or higher .NET: Framework: Agent versions 2.12.146.0 or higher .NET Core 2.0: Agent versions 8.3.360.0 or higher (Windows only) Linux: .NET Core 3.0 or higher and agent versions 8.23 or higher Python: Agent versions 1.7.0 or higher Ruby: Agent versions 3.5.5 or higher Start the profiler The thread profiler feature is enabled by default. You also may be able to turn it on or off in your agent configuration file: Java: thread_profiler.enabled NET: You cannot disable the thread profiler with .NET apps. Python: thread_profiler.enabled Ruby: thread_profiler.enabled When enabled, you can view the thread profiler from our user interface: Go to one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Thread profiler. Select the host you want to run the profiler on. Set the duration for the profiling session. Select Start profiler. This triggers the agent to start the thread profiler during the next harvest cycle (every one minute) and capture data for the specified duration. We record thread backtraces whether or not they are in a runnable state at the time the sample is taken. Threads that are sleeping or blocked on IO may appear in the call tree. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Thread profiler: Use this page to define the settings for the thread profiler duration and to view the results. View profile data After the profiler finishes running, the agent will report the profile data. The call tree automatically appears on the Thread profiler page. The percentages in the call tree represent the percentage of thread backtrace samples in which each call path appeared during the profiling session. The data collection started at the PROFILE COLLECTED time. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Thread profiler > (selected profile): Here is an example of a call tree from a thread profile. The page color-codes the tree results: Red: Percentages greater than 30% Yellow: Percentages greater than 10% Black: Percentages less than 10% If you want to... Do this...

View summary information about any line in the call tree Mouse over the line. Email the thread profile results to others Select Share this profile. Start another session or view a different thread profile Select Back to all profiles. Agent considerations Depending on which agent you use, the thread profiling feature has additional considerations. .NET-specific notes When using thread profiling with the .NET Framework agent, be aware of the following. .NET agent Thread profiler notes Supported on Linux Thread profiling on Linux is supported on .NET Core 3.0 or later applications when running .NET agent version 8.23 or later. Managed threads only For .NET agents, the thread profiler only captures stack traces on managed threads. It does not capture stack traces on unmanaged threads. If a call to an unmanaged function occurs on a managed thread, the thread profiler will show Native:Function Call in the call tree. No line numbers A .NET thread profile does not include line numbers in the call tree. The Show line numbers checkbox in the Tree Settings does not have any effect. Bug with 64-bit v4.0 .NET CLR There is a bug in the 64-bit version 4.0 .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) that interferes with the agent's ability to retrieve managed stack traces. If your app experiences this bug, APM will show empty thread profiles. This bug does not affect 32-bit applications. The bug is fixed in the CLR releases for .NET 4.5. To verify whether your 64-bit application has the fixed version, look at the full version of the mscorlib.dll in the C: \\ Windows \\ Microsoft.NET \\ Framework64 \\ v4.0.30319 directory. The fix is in versions 4.0.30319.17379 or higher. Other category only All threads are put in the Other category. The Web Request and Background categories are not supported. Python-specific notes When using thread profiling with the Python agent, be aware of the following. Python agent Thread profiler notes Co-routine based systems There are limits to capturing details when a co-routine based system is being used, such as gevent or eventlet modes of gunicorn. If creating a new thread, the Python agent will actually create a greenlet instead of a thread profiler background thread. Therefore, the thread profiler will not capture any web request and background transactions on the thread profiler page. Greenlets A greenlet can run only when other greenlets explicitly yield control, such as when they block. For example, if the thread sampler does get to run, it will only sample the stack for other greenlets at a point where they are blocked. It will not sample them when they are executing arbitrary code. It can completely miss execution within a greenlet if it never blocked or otherwise yielded to another greenlet. Time in Python code Time spent in pure Python code that isn't blocking requests will not be picked up, and no information will be recorded or reported. This is because results are misleading when co-routines are used. Ruby-specific notes When using thread profiling with the Ruby agent, be aware of the following. Ruby agent Thread profiler notes Backtraces The thread profiler depends on the ability to capture thread backtraces from within your Ruby application. For this reason, it requires MRI 1.9.2 or higher (for the Thread#backtrace method). Resque The Ruby agent does not currently support thread profiles with Resque background jobs. A thread profiling session initiated against Resque will only capture traces from the parent process, not the job processes. JRuby JRuby support is considered experimental at this time. There are known issues with JRuby's Thread#backtrace implementation that will affect the accuracy of and reliability of backtraces collected under JRuby.",

      "body": "In order to report request queuing, New Relic agents depend on an HTTP header set by the front-end web server (such as Apache or Nginx) or load balancer (such as HAProxy or F5). These examples use the X-Request-Start header, since it is has broader support across platforms. If this does not work with your server configuration for request queuing, try using the X-Queue-Start header. The syntax should otherwise be the same. Apache Apache's mod_headers module includes a %t variable that is formatted correctly. To enable request queue reporting, add this code to your Apache config: RequestHeader set X-Request-Start \"%t\" Copy Nginx If you are using Nginx version 1.2.6 or higher and the latest version of the Ruby, Python, or PHP agent, Nginx can easily be configured to report queue time. (For Nginx versions 1.2.6 or lower, you must recompile Nginx with a module or patch.) Configuring with Nginx 1.2.6 or higher uses the ${msec} variable, which is a number in seconds with milliseconds resolution. For more information, see http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#variables. Add the appropriate information to your Nginx config: Nginx configuration Values General Nginx use proxy_set_header X-Request-Start \"t=${msec}\"; Copy Passenger Version 5 or higher: >passenger_set_header X-REQUEST-START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy Older versions: passenger_set_cgi_param X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy fastcgi fastcgi_param HTTP_X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy uWSGI uwsgi_param HTTP_X_REQUEST_START \"t=${msec}\"; Copy F5 load balancers For F5 load balancers, use this configuration snippet: when HTTP_REQUEST_SEND { # TCL 8.4 so we have to calculate the time in millisecond resolution # Calculation from: https://groups.google.com/forum/? fromgroups=#!topic/comp.lang.tcl/tV9H6TDv0t8 set secs [clock seconds] set ms [clock clicks -milliseconds] set base [expr { $secs * 1000 }] set fract [expr { $ms - $base }] if { $fract >= 1000 } { set diff [expr { $fract / 1000 }] incr secs $diff incr fract [expr { -1000 * $diff }] } set micros [format \"%d%03d000\" $secs $fract] # Want this header inserted as if coming from the client clientside { HTTP::header insert X-Request-Start \"t=${micros}\" } } Copy Network timing Even with request queuing configured, the front-end server's setup can still affect network time in your Browser data. This is because the front-end server does not add the queuing time header until after it actually accepts and processes the request. The queuing time headers can never account for backlog in the listener socket used to accept requests. For example, if the front-end server's configuration results in a backlog of requests that queue in the listener socket, page load timing will show an increase in network time.",

Depending on the specifics of your production systems, this measurement of time may or may not include an actual queue that requests enter. It may also represent other functions (such as load balancing or internal network latency). Use request queuing to identify scaling problems Tracking time spent in request queuing is useful for identifying certain types of performance and scaling problems; for example: When your front-end web server is spending time waiting for application workers to become available When extra time is spent warming up application workers after a deploy or restart You must configure your New Relic agent and server to report request queuing. Then the information will appear in the selected application's Requests time chart for web transactions (from APM's Applications list, select the app), as well as other places in the user interface. The chart's legend indicates which color represents request queueing. Apdex calculations Request queuing is the time from when the browser requests content to the time it receives the content. Since your Apdex score will reflect these calculations, you can select whether to report request queue time separately or not. For more information, see Agent configuration. Clock skew If the front-end web server (such as Nginx) and your application do not reside on the same physical server, reported request queuing may be affected by clock skew. NTP provides an excellent way to keep server clocks in sync. However, they still will drift relative to each other. Since New Relic agents rely on a timestamp set by the front-end server, it may over- or under-report request queuing if the clock on that server is not closely synchronized with the clock on the app server. This may seem like a major problem with the feature; however, clock skew is unlikely to result in sudden spikes in reported request queuing. Sudden spikes generally occur when an app is restarted or becomes overloaded with requests. Our experience is that request queue reporting can be useful to identify real performance problems, but be sure to consider clock skew when interpreting this data.",

      "body": "Request queuing occurs before the request reaches your application (where the agent resides). This is why you need to do some straightforward configuration of the agent and your production hosts to take advantage of this feature. HTTP header In order to report request queuing, most New Relic agents depend on an HTTP header set by the front-end web server (such as Apache or Nginx) or load balancer (such as HAProxy or F5). You can configure these front-end servers to set the timestamp in the HTTP header that represents when the request first entered your production infrastructure. Tip Set this header as soon after the request enters your infrastructure as possible so that you are less likely to miss performance problems in your infrastructure that occur before the header is set. Most New Relic agents will interpret an X-Queue-Start or X-Request-Start header and use it to calculate Request Queuing. The agents treat these headers identically. Include a value in the format t=MICROSECONDS_SINCE_EPOCH where MICROSECONDS_SINCE_EPOCH is an integer value of the number of microseconds that have elapsed since the beginning of the Unix epoch (for example, January 1, 1970). Nearly any front-end HTTP server or load balancer can be configured to add this header. Additional details depend on your specific agent and server configuration. For more information, see the request queue configuration examples. C SDK The C SDK does not support request queuing. Go agent With the Go agent, set either header to record a metric for it. Java, Node.js, Python, Ruby agents The most recent versions of the Java, Node.js, Python, and Ruby agents provide more flexibility in the format of the X-Request-Start or X-Queue-Start header. These agents allow the timestamp to be submitted in seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds as an integer or floating point value. These agents also allow the leading t= in the header value to be omitted. Based on the order of magnitude, these agents automatically interpret the time unit as seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds. New Relic can do this reliably since a millisecond timestamp, interpreted as microseconds, would result in a queue time over 40 years. Python agent only: When using Apache/mod_wsgi 3.4 or higher, mod_wsgi will automatically insert an equivalent to the X-Queue-Start header into the WSGI environ dictionary for each request. This will mark the specific point in time where Apache first accepted the request. The value set by mod_wsgi will be picked up and used by the Python agent if no separate X-Request-Start or X-Queue-Start header has been manually configured into a web server's front end or in Apache itself. .NET agent The .NET agent does not require (and will ignore) any configuration of HTTP headers to calculate queue time. It works by instrumenting the IIS-queuing mechanism directly and reports queue time as the difference between when the HttpContext constructor executes and when the HttpApplication.BeginRequest event fires. Request queue time is only reported for .NET Framework applications hosted on IIS (for example: ASP.NET applications). It is not reported for ASP .NET Core applications (targeting .NET Core or Framework), nor for self-hosted OWIN applications. PHP agent The PHP agent only supports the X-Request-Start header. This identifies the timestamp in microseconds as an integer, with an optional t= in the header value. To ensure that the header is read properly, check your phpinfo() under the PHP Variables section, and verify that _SERVER[\"HTTP_X_REQUEST_START\"] exists and is in the expected format. If you are using Nginx, see Request queue server configuration examples for additional information on setting the header.",

      "body": "APM tracks the time after a request enters your production systems and before it reaches your application. We call this portion of your request's life cycle request queuing. Depending on the specifics of your production systems, this measurement of time may or may not include an actual queue that requests enter. It may also represent other functions (such as load balancing or internal network latency). Use request queuing to identify scaling problems Tracking time spent in request queuing is useful for identifying certain types of performance and scaling problems; for example: When your front-end web server is spending time waiting for application workers to become available When extra time is spent warming up application workers after a deploy or restart You must configure your New Relic agent and server to report request queuing. Then the information will appear in the selected application's Requests time chart for web transactions (from APM's Applications list, select the app), as well as other places in the user interface. The chart's legend indicates which color represents request queueing. Apdex calculations Request queuing is the time from when the browser requests content to the time it receives the content. Since your Apdex score will reflect these calculations, you can select whether to report request queue time separately or not. For more information, see Agent configuration. Clock skew If the front-end web server (such as Nginx) and your application do not reside on the same physical server, reported request queuing may be affected by clock skew. NTP provides an excellent way to keep server clocks in sync. However, they still will drift relative to each other. Since New Relic agents rely on a timestamp set by the front-end server, it may over- or under-report request queuing if the clock on that server is not closely synchronized with the clock on the app server. This may seem like a major problem with the feature; however, clock skew is unlikely to result in sudden spikes in reported request queuing. Sudden spikes generally occur when an app is restarted or becomes overloaded with requests. Our experience is that request queue reporting can be useful to identify real performance problems, but be sure to consider clock skew when interpreting this data.",

      "body": "Information about Trace API data requirements, including: Data specifications and max limits Required metadata (headers, query parameters) Response validation details This document applies to the Trace API overall. For rules regarding specific data formats, see: New Relic-format trace data Zipkin-format trace data Endpoints All trace data is sent via a POST to a Trace API endpoint. We have a few endpoints, depending on your setup: Default Trace API endpoint: https://trace-api.newrelic.com/trace/v1 EU data centers: https://trace-api.eu.newrelic.com/trace/v1 (see other EU endpoints). Infinite Tracing: when you complete the Trace observer setup, you get a custom YOUR_TRACE_OBSERVER_URL value to use as an endpoint. If you're using an integration that uses the Trace API (for example, these integrations), you must configure that integration with that endpoint. You will also want to adjust the sampling of your tracing service to send us 100% of spans. For FedRAMP, see FedRAMP endpoints. Data formats Currently, the Trace API accepts two types of data formats: zipkin: For reporting Zipkin trace data. Zipkin data must be Zipkin JSON v2. newrelic: For reporting all other trace data. Data limits Data limits and rules: Condition Limit Max age of span timestamp values 20 minutes. timestamp must be within 20 minutes of current time at ingest, or within 20 minutes from the time the last span with the same trace.id was received by New Relic. Max payload size 1MB (10^6 bytes) (gzip compression supported) Max requests per minute 100K Max spans per minute per account family Dependent on agreement. Max limit: 2M. Max spans per trace 50K Max attributes per span 200 Max span attribute value length 4000 characters Allowed HTTP protocols HTTPS only Cross-account visibility of span details Potential data obfuscation To see an example of how span limits are enforced, see Exceeding limits. Restricted attributes The attributes in the table below are restricted in the newrelic-format JSON (in the attributes block) and in the zipkin-format JSON (in the tags block). Any values with these keys will be omitted: Restricted attribute description entityGuid string Unique identifier for the entity that created this span. Generated from service.name, if available. guid string Used for backwards compatibility with data from APM agents. Request metadata (headers and query parameters) The following table shows the required request metadata for all trace data formats. This metadata can be sent as HTTP headers on an ingest request or, in some cases, provided as query parameters, which may be required for tracing frameworks that don't allow header modification. Important Security note: We suggest using headers because query parameters are present in the URL and may be logged before being encrypted and received by New Relic. All data sent as query parameters must be URL-safe. Header Query param? Details Content-Type No Required. Must be application/json. Content-Length No Required. The length of the request body in octets (8-bit bytes) unless sent with chunked encoding. This header is generally set by default by the underlying HTTP client sending the data and in most cases should not require any additional effort by the end user. Api-Key Yes (case-sensitive) Required. The Trace API requires the Insights insert key. If this is provided as both a header and a query parameter, the values must match. Content-Encoding No Required if compressed payload. The value must be gzip. Data-Format Yes Required for zipkin. Optional for newrelic. If present, Data-Format-Version must also be present. Data-Format-Version Yes Required for zipkin. If present, Data-Format must also be present. There are only two possible pairings for these values: If Data-Format is zipkin, Data-Format-Version must be 2. If Data-Format is newrelic, Data-Format-Version must be 1. x-request-id No Optional - Reserved for future use. The value must be a valid UUID4. The value is expected to be unique for each request. Response validation A response for successfully sending trace data will include a requestId. For example: {\"requestId\":\"c1bb62fc-001a-b000-0000-016bb152e1bb\"} Copy There are two ways success/errors are signaled: HTTP status code (synchronous). Authentication and request errors will be signaled via HTTP status code. See HTTP status codes Code Meaning 202 Data accepted. This means that you've passed preliminary checks, but is not a guarantee that the data has been successfully parsed and indexed as part of a distributed trace. 400 The structure of the request was invalid. Errors with query parameters, etc. 403 Authentication error. May occur with an invalid license key or if you lack necessary entitlement to use the Trace API. 404 The request path is incorrect. 405 For any request method other than POST. 408 The request took too long to reach the endpoint. 411 The Content-Length header wasn’t included. 413 The payload was too big. 414 The request URI was too long. 415 The Content-Type or Content-Encoding was invalid. 429 The request rate quota has been exceeded. 431 The request headers are too long. 5xx There was a server error (please retry). NrIntegrationError events (asynchronous). Errors with the JSON payload or other semantic errors are asynchronously signaled via NrIntegrationError events that are stored in the account whose license key is associated with the request. For all errors of this type, the attribute newRelicFeature will be Distributed Tracing and requestId will be the requestId from the endpoint response. If you receive a 202 response and don't see an NrIntegrationError event, your data should be visible in New Relic One's global distributed tracing UI in about a minute. You should be able to find the trace using a standard trace search like: traceId = TRACE_ID_SENT Copy Exceeding span limits When you exceed your span rate limit, an NrIntegrationError event is generated. You can query rate limit messages with this NRQL: SELECT * FROM NrIntegrationError WHERE newRelicFeature = 'Distributed Tracing' AND category = 'RateLimit' AND rateLimitType = 'SpansPerMinute' Copy To get a notification when you exceed the limit, you can set up a NRQL alert. We calculate a rolling 10-minute average based on your span rate limit. This allows for temporary rate bursts, and lets us prioritize keeping and dropping complete traces instead of indiscriminately dropping spans on a per minute limit basis. In the example below of exceeding the rate, the rate limit is the default 100,000 spans per minute. New Relic allows a burst above 100K for a couple of minutes without downsampling, because the remaining minutes in the 10-minute window averaged under 100K spans/minute. For the previous 10 minutes (8:50 - 9:00) the service received 60,000 spans/minute. Minute Spans sent to API Total for past 10 minutes 8:59 60,000 600,000 9:00 40,000 580,000 9:01 50,000 570,000 9:02 250,000 760,000 9:03 220,000 920,000 9:04 125,000 985,000 9:05 70,000 995,000 9:06 50,000 985,000 9:07 40,000 965,000 9:08 40,000 945,000 9:09 40,000 925,000",

Forever. What is the Trace API? The Trace API is one way that New Relic collects distributed tracing data. We have some tracing tools that report data via this API (Infinite Tracing, our open source integrations, and our Telemetry SDKs), or you can use the API directly to create your own tracing implementation. Reasons to use the Trace API: You have your own custom distributed tracing tool and want to see that data in New Relic without changing your instrumentation. You have a tool that emits tracing data but that requires a backend for trace storage. You want to report distributed tracing data to New Relic without the use of our installed solutions. You use Zipkin and want to see that trace data in New Relic without changing your instrumentation. Want to understand how trace data relates to other New Relic data? Read about our data types. Requirements For details about what data you can send and how it is handled, see Rules and limits. Sampling considerations When using the Trace API, you have the option to enable Infinite Tracing. Whether you use Infinite Tracing has implications for how you configure sampling: Use your own sampling (no Infinite Tracing): If you don't use Infinite Tracing, it's assumed you want to use your own sampling implementation to sample traces before they're sent to us. (If your trace data exceeds our data limits, we do enact sampling.) Use Infinite Tracing: If you want to use Infinite Tracing, a typical approach is to send us 100% of your trace data and rely on Infinite Tracing sampling. (When you go through the Start reporting data instructions, below, you'll have an option for enabling Infinite Tracing.) Start reporting data The Trace API accepts trace data in these two JSON formats: zipkin: the Zipkin JSON v2 trace data format (learn what Zipkin is). Get started sending Zipkin data. newrelic: our general format. If you don't have Zipkin-format data, use this. Get started sending New Relic-format data. Having problems getting data to report? See Troubleshooting. Find data You can find data sent via the Trace API, or from integrations that use this API, in these locations: In our distributed tracing UI. By querying: For details about how to query and create custom charts, see Query distributed tracing data.

      "body": "The APM agent that you installed receives data from your applications. The default data retention is based on your pricing edition. New Relic's default security settings automatically work to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You can also change these settings. Disclosure and audit Our APM agent is a publicly accessible plugin for web applications. The agent does not do any dynamic code generation while communicating with your app, so using the agent will not introduce any code into your application without your knowledge. Most of our agents are open source, so you can see what our code does: C SDK Go .NET Node.js Python Ruby Data collection Using a JSON message format, data the agent receives from your app is posted once a minute to the New Relic user interface. The website returns a JSON response to the agent, indicating if the data was correctly received or if there was an error. New Relic collects the following aggregate metric data: Database activity External web service calls Controller and dispatch activity View activity Uncaught exceptions and counts Process memory and CPU usage This aggregate metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and various response time statistics (average, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation). In New Relic, you will see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. New Relic optionally collects: Data collection Comments Uncaught errors New Relic captures the error as well as a runtime stack trace of the offending code. Transaction traces These are snapshots of a single transaction. As an option, the agent can also collect the query statements called within the transaction. The default collection uses obfuscation to hide any strings or numbers from the query. For transactions slower than a threshold you set, New Relic also collects data from SQL EXPLAIN. For database calls slower than a configured threshold, New Relic optionally collects runtime stack traces, which are helpful to pinpoint where in the code a database call is made. Custom parameters You can add custom parameters to your application code and record them with transaction traces to provide additional context while you are examining profiling information. Optional: For both errors and transaction traces, the HTTP request parameters can also be recorded. Security settings If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. Default security settings Depending on the agent, the default settings provide security for request parameters, HTTPS usage, and SQL: C SDK default security settings Go default security settings Java default security settings .NET default security settings Node.js default security settings PHP default security settings Python default security settings Ruby default security settings High security mode When the agent is in high security mode, default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition, high security mode applies restrictions to custom events, custom instrumentation, user attributes, exception messages, or message queue parameters, depending on the agent: C SDK: n/a Go high security mode settings Java high security mode settings .NET high security mode settings Node.js high security mode settings PHP high security mode settings Python high security mode settings Ruby high security mode settings Custom security settings If you want custom security settings, you can customize the configuration file, change custom attribute settings, or use the API, depending on your agent: C SDK custom security settings Go custom security settings Java custom security settings .NET custom security mode settings Node.js custom security settings PHP custom security settings Python custom security settings Ruby custom security settings Data received by New Relic This information applies to all APM agents no matter what security settings you have applied. Important Other data that New Relic receives is specific to the security settings for each agent. Data Captured? APM agent language version OS type and version System properties Average response time of transactions in your app URL hits Client IP address Not captured TLS and SSL Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. APM agents enable SSL by default. To verify which release includes SSL by default and to ensure that you have the most up-to-date version, refer to your agent's release notes: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby The configuration file also includes an optional flag (ssl) to enable or disable SSL using HTTPS. New Relic does not do host authentication with HTTPS, just communication encryption. Exception: You cannot disable SSL for the C SDK. The C SDK daemon can only connect with SSL. New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the REST API. This includes both inbound and outbound traffic. If your REST API call uses HTTP, or if you have disabled SSL in your configuration file, change your script or program to HTTPS. Data transmission Under Java, .NET and PHP, New Relic uses JSON to serialize data. The Ruby agent uses either Ruby marshaling or JSON serialization to send data to New Relic, depending on whether a native JSON encoder is available in under the Ruby version the agent is running on. For required changes when you want to create firewall rules to allow the agent to communicate, see Networks. For more information about security measures for your data in transit to New Relic or at rest in our storage, see Data encryption. Proxies Optional settings are available so that you can configure the agent to communicate through a proxy. To define proxy settings for host, port, domain, user, or password, refer to your agent's configuration file documentation: Agent Proxy settings C SDK -proxy at daemon startup Go transport Java Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_password proxy_port proxy_user .NET proxy element Node.js proxy PHP newrelic.daemon.proxy or the daemon's proxy setting Python proxy settings Ruby Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_port proxy_user proxy_pass",

Depending on the language agent, available settings may include: Transaction tracing SQL recording and logging SQL query plans Error collection Thread profiling Distributed tracing Cross application tracing Centralization and security Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic UI. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings. Any change automatically applies to all New Relic APM agents, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the local configurations for any settings not available from the UI. Server-side configuration precedence This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly within the New Relic UI, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you utilize environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used. For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent: C SDK configuration: A hierarchy is not applicable, because configuration values come from API calls. Also, server-side configuration is not supported. However, you can change the app name from the UI or from the C SDK configuration settings. Go hierarchy Java hierarchy .NET hierarchy Node.js hierarchy PHP hierarchy (server-side configuration not supported) Python hierarchy Ruby hierarchy Enable server-side configuration Tip Owner, Admins, or Add-on Managers The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To enable server-side configuration settings for apps that use other New Relic agents: Go to rpm.newrelic.com/apm > (select an app) > Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. OR Go to rpm.newrelic.com/apm. Next, from the index of applications, select the app's gear icon, then select View settings > Server-side agent configuration. Set the Server-side configuration enabled toggle to On. Select Save server-side configuration. After you enable server-side configuration, you can view and change the available settings through the UI. View or change server-side configuration settings Tip Owner, Admins, or Add-on Managers If you use server-side configuration, you must still include your license_key and app_name in the local config file. These settings are required for the agent to communicate with the New Relic collector. The C SDK and PHP agent do not support server-side configuration. To view or change the available server-side configuration settings through the UI for apps that use other New Relic agents: Go to rpm.newrelic.com/apm > (select an app) > Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration. OR Go to rpm.newrelic.com/apm. Next, from the index of applications, select the app's gear icon, then select View settings > Server-side agent configuration. View or change the available configuration settings for your agent. If you make changes, select Save server-side configuration. Once you set any of these options from the UI, they will override any conflicting options in the agent's configuration file. Disable server-side configuration Once you enable server-side configuration for an account, server-side configuration cannot be turned off without assistance from New Relic Support. This helps mitigate issues that could arise from conflicts with configuration settings if you need to transition back to a local configuration setup.",

      "body": "Deploying an app can be a risky event—when your app breaks, a bad deployment is often the cause. New Relic allows you to track deployments so you can correlate deploy to your app's performance. Tracking deployments creates deployment markers that appear in APM charts. Options for tracking deployments You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record new deployments, retrieve a list of past deployments, and delete past deployments on your APM application. In addition, some APM agents have agent-specific methods to record deployments automatically. You can use your Slack integration with New Relic, or a simple webhook, to notify your team in real time of deployments for applications monitored by APM. Slack provides a webhook URL that allows you to post generic JSON that will appear formatted in a chosen Slack channel. There are a few places where you can view deployments in the New Relic UI after they have been recorded. You can view deployments in the UI: In the activity feed of the APM Summary, New Relic One Service summary, and entity summary pages. On APM performance charts as a chart marker. On the Deployments page for summary performance. Tip Deployment markers are not available for Browser applications, but see Browser releases for a way to tag errors with release versions. Record deployments with the REST API You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record deployments, get a list of past deployments, and delete deployments. The examples in this document use curl as a command line tool. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. You can also create, view, and delete deployments with the API Explorer. JSON uses double quotes \" for element names and content. Using single quotes ' will cause errors. Record a deployment with POST To record a new deployment, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. For example: curl -X POST \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \\ '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy Record a deployment with PowerShell To record a deployment with PowerShell, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. This example uses PowerShell version 3 or higher: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json -Method POST -Headers @{'Api-Key'='$API_KEY'} -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy This example uses PowerShell version 2 (requires .NET framework 3.5 or higher): $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding(\"ASCII\") $data ='{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' $postData = $encoding.GetBytes($data) $request = [System.Net.WebRequest]::Create('https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json') $request.Method = 'POST' $request.Headers.add('Api-Key','$API_KEY') $request.ContentType='application/json' $stream = $request.GetRequestStream() $stream.Write($postData,0,$postData.Length) $request.GetResponse() Copy View a list of deployments with GET To retrieve a list of all past deployments for your app, send a GET request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. GET requests do not use a JSON payload. For example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Sample output from GET This example requests a list of deployments for app ID 9999999: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/9999999/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx\" \\ -i Copy The API returns this list of deployments: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ETag: \"ABCDEFGHIJKabcdefghijk0123456789\" Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate Content-Type: application/json { \"deployments\": [ { \"id\": 1234567, \"revision\": \"1234123412341234123412341234123412341234\", \"changelog\": \"Fixed the bugs for real this time\", \"description\": \"Example description two\", \"user\": \"Data Nerd\", \"timestamp\": \"2016-02-24T10:09:27-08:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } }, { \"id\": 2345678, \"revision\": \"7890789078907890789078907890789078907890\", \"changelog\": \"Think I fixed all the bugs\", \"description\": null, \"user\": \"Dren Atad\", \"timestamp\": \"2014-10-22T12:23:47-07:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } } ], \"links\": { \"deployment.agent\": \"/v2/applications/{application_id}\" } } Copy Delete a deployment with DELETE To delete a deployment, send a DELETE request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. DELETE requests do not use a JSON payload, but you must specify the ID for the deployment you want to delete. To retrieve the ID for a deployment, use the GET request. For example: curl -X DELETE \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments/$DEPLOYMENT_ID.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Character limits and JSON parameters The JSON payload can include the following parameters. Important UTF-8 4 byte characters, such as Emojis and some non-Latin language glyphs, cannot be used in the deployment text. Parameter Data type Description revision String, 127 character maximum Required. A unique ID for this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. Can be any string, but is usually a version number or a Git checksum. changelog String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A summary of what changed in this deployment, visible in the Deployments page when you select (selected deployment) > Change log. description String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A high-level description of this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page when you select an individual deployment. user String, 31 character maximum Optional. A username to associate with the deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. timestamp ISO 8601 Optional. When the deployment occurred, down to the second. If not specified, the deployment will be recorded at the time when the API call was received. Timestamp requirements: Must be in UTC time. Must be after the most recent deployment timestamp. Cannot be in the future. Must be in ISO8601 format; for example, \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\". Record deployments using the New Relic agent Some agents have additional methods to record deployments: All agents: Use the New Relic REST API v2. C: No SDK-specific methods. Use the REST API. Go: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. Java: Call the Java agent jar. .NET: Use PowerShell and the REST API. Node.js: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. PHP: Use a PHP script. Python: Use the record-deploy subcommand of the newrelic-admin script. Ruby: Use a Capistrano recipe. Notify your team of deployments After a deployment is recorded using the REST API, you can optionally notify a webhook endpoint of the deployment. The destination of the webhook can be your Slack instance. To use webhooks to set up a deployment notification for a Slack channel: Log in to your Slack account as an admin, then go to App directory > Manage > Apps. Search for your New Relic app, then select Add configuration. From Post to channel, select an existing Slack channel or add a new channel, then Add configuration. From the list of options, copy the webhook URL. Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Integrations > Deploy notifications > Webhook. Paste the Slack webhook URL, then save. Optional: Send a test message. Tip You can also use webhooks, Slack channels, and other options for alert notifications with New Relic Alerts. End of life notification: Hipchat, Campfire As of September 9, 2019, integrations with Hipchat and Campfire for APM deployment notifications will no longer be available. Recommendation: If you are still using Hipchat or Campfire, use webhooks with Slack channels instead. For more information, see the New Relic Explorers Hub post.",

New Relic collects the following aggregate metric data: Database activity External web service calls Controller and dispatch activity View activity Uncaught exceptions and counts Process memory and CPU usage This aggregate metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and various response time statistics (average, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation). In New Relic, you will see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. New Relic optionally collects: Data collection Comments Uncaught errors New Relic captures the error as well as a runtime stack trace of the offending code. Transaction traces These are snapshots of a single transaction. As an option, the agent can also collect the query statements called within the transaction. The default collection uses obfuscation to hide any strings or numbers from the query. For transactions slower than a threshold you set, New Relic also collects data from SQL EXPLAIN. For database calls slower than a configured threshold, New Relic optionally collects runtime stack traces, which are helpful to pinpoint where in the code a database call is made. Custom parameters You can add custom parameters to your application code and record them with transaction traces to provide additional context while you are examining profiling information. Optional: For both errors and transaction traces, the HTTP request parameters can also be recorded. Security settings If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. Default security settings Depending on the agent, the default settings provide security for request parameters, HTTPS usage, and SQL: C SDK default security settings Go default security settings Java default security settings .NET default security settings Node.js default security settings PHP default security settings Python default security settings Ruby default security settings High security mode When the agent is in high security mode, default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition, high security mode applies restrictions to custom events, custom instrumentation, user attributes, exception messages, or message queue parameters, depending on the agent: C SDK: n/a Go high security mode settings Java high security mode settings .NET high security mode settings Node.js high security mode settings PHP high security mode settings Python high security mode settings Ruby high security mode settings Custom security settings If you want custom security settings, you can customize the configuration file, change custom attribute settings, or use the API, depending on your agent: C SDK custom security settings Go custom security settings Java custom security settings .NET custom security mode settings Node.js custom security settings PHP custom security settings Python custom security settings Ruby custom security settings Data received by New Relic This information applies to all APM agents no matter what security settings you have applied. Important Other data that New Relic receives is specific to the security settings for each agent. Data Captured? APM agent language version OS type and version System properties Average response time of transactions in your app URL hits Client IP address Not captured TLS and SSL Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. APM agents enable SSL by default. To verify which release includes SSL by default and to ensure that you have the most up-to-date version, refer to your agent's release notes: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby The configuration file also includes an optional flag (ssl) to enable or disable SSL using HTTPS. New Relic does not do host authentication with HTTPS, just communication encryption. Exception: You cannot disable SSL for the C SDK. The C SDK daemon can only connect with SSL. New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the REST API. This includes both inbound and outbound traffic. If your REST API call uses HTTP, or if you have disabled SSL in your configuration file, change your script or program to HTTPS. Data transmission Under Java, .NET and PHP, New Relic uses JSON to serialize data. The Ruby agent uses either Ruby marshaling or JSON serialization to send data to New Relic, depending on whether a native JSON encoder is available in under the Ruby version the agent is running on. For required changes when you want to create firewall rules to allow the agent to communicate, see Networks. For more information about security measures for your data in transit to New Relic or at rest in our storage, see Data encryption. Proxies Optional settings are available so that you can configure the agent to communicate through a proxy. To define proxy settings for host, port, domain, user, or password, refer to your agent's configuration file documentation: Agent Proxy settings C SDK -proxy at daemon startup Go transport Java Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_password proxy_port proxy_user .NET proxy element Node.js proxy PHP newrelic.daemon.proxy or the daemon's proxy setting Python proxy settings Ruby Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_port proxy_user proxy_pass",

      "body": "Apdex is an industry standard to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of web applications and services. It's a simplified Service Level Agreement (SLA) solution that helps you see how satisfied users are with your app through metrics such as Apdex score and dissatisfaction percentage instead of easily skewed traditional metrics such as average response time. Apdex measurements Apdex is a measure of response time based against a set threshold. It measures the ratio of satisfactory response times to unsatisfactory response times. The response time is measured from an asset request to completed delivery back to the requestor. After you define a response time threshold T, all responses handled in T or less time satisfy the user. For example, if T is 1.2 seconds and a response completes in 0.5 seconds, then the user is satisfied. All responses greater than 1.2 seconds dissatisfy the user. Responses greater than 4.8 seconds frustrate the user. You can define multiple Apdex T values for each of these: Apdex measurements Comments APM apps APM monitors the performance of these apps. To define their Apdex settings, use the APM UI. You can find Apdex on the APM Summary page and the Browser Summary page. Browser apps Browser monitors the end-user experience for these apps. To define end-user Apdex settings for these apps, use the Browser UI. New Relic labels them as End user on the APM Overview page and the Browser Overview page. Key transactions These are transactions important to your business that you choose to monitor. You can define Apdex settings for key transactions on the Key transactions page. Important The key transaction Apdex setting overrides the T value of that app. For details, see Key transaction Apdex. Apdex levels Apdex tracks three response counts: Satisfied: The response time is less than or equal to T. Tolerating: The response time is greater than T and less than or equal to 4T. In this example, 4 x 1.2 = 4.8 seconds is the maximum tolerable response time. Frustrated: The response time is greater than 4T or the request returns a server-side error. A high error rate can cause you to have a satisfying average response time, yet a poor Apdex score. Your configuration file's apdex_f value is four times your app server's Apdex T value. This threshold is useful, for example, with transaction traces. For more information, see the configuration file documentation for your New Relic agent. The time calculation will change based on your own app's T setting. In the following example, T = 1.2 seconds. Level Multiplier Time (T Example = 1.2) Satisfied T or less < = 1.2 seconds Tolerated > T, < = 4T Between 1.2 and 4.8 seconds Frustrated > 4T Greater than 4.8 seconds After you define your Apdex levels, use any of New Relic's resources to help identify and troubleshoot changes that indicate poor customer experiences with your app. Apdex score The Apdex score is a ratio value of the number of satisfied and tolerating requests to the total requests made. Each satisfied request counts as one request, while each tolerating request counts as half a satisfied request. An Apdex score varies from 0 to 1, with 0 as the worst possible score (100% of response times were Frustrated), and 1 as the best possible score (100% of response times were Satisfied). Example Apdex score: During a 2 minute period a host handles 200 requests. The Apdex threshold T = 0.5 seconds (500ms). This value is arbitrary and is selected by the user. 170 of the requests were handled within 500ms, so they are classified as Satisfied. 20 of the requests were handled between 500ms and 2 seconds (2000 ms), so they are classified as Tolerating. The remaining 10 were not handled properly or took longer than 2 seconds, so they are classified as Frustrated. The resulting Apdex score is 0.9: (170 + (20/2))/200 = 0.9. Important The formula used for calculating the Apdex score is designed for high-throughput apps. If your app's throughput is less than 100 RPM, not enough data is collected to determine a stable score. The instability may result in Apdex alert conditions behaving unexpectedly. Errors pages Any request that returns a server-side error such as 500: Application Error is a frustrating response, regardless of its return speed. You can use Apdex to visualize the impact of these errors, and then identify and resolve these errors with New Relic's built-in error analytics and error profile tools. Dissatisfaction percentage The dissatisfaction percentage is the percentage of the total dissatisfaction experienced by the app's users that is contributed by this transaction. Example Apdex dissatisfaction calculation: Frustrations(Transaction) + Tolerations(Transaction)/2 Frustrations(App) + Tolerations(App)/2 To visualize dissatisfaction percentage, you can sort your transactions by most dissatisfying. If a transaction is always frustratingly slow but rarely visited, it will not contribute much to the app's total dissatisfaction. Conversely, if a transaction is normally fast, but has high throughput, this may contribute a large proportion of the app's dissatisfaction simply because it contributes a large proportion of your app's traffic.",

      "body": "The APM agent that you installed receives data from your applications. The default data retention is based on your pricing edition. New Relic's default security settings automatically work to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You can also change these settings. Disclosure and audit Our APM agent is a publicly accessible plugin for web applications. The agent does not do any dynamic code generation while communicating with your app, so using the agent will not introduce any code into your application without your knowledge. Most of our agents are open source, so you can see what our code does: C SDK Go .NET Node.js Python Ruby Data collection Using a JSON message format, data the agent receives from your app is posted once a minute to the New Relic user interface. The website returns a JSON response to the agent, indicating if the data was correctly received or if there was an error. New Relic collects the following aggregate metric data: Database activity External web service calls Controller and dispatch activity View activity Uncaught exceptions and counts Process memory and CPU usage This aggregate metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and various response time statistics (average, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation). In New Relic, you will see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. New Relic optionally collects: Data collection Comments Uncaught errors New Relic captures the error as well as a runtime stack trace of the offending code. Transaction traces These are snapshots of a single transaction. As an option, the agent can also collect the query statements called within the transaction. The default collection uses obfuscation to hide any strings or numbers from the query. For transactions slower than a threshold you set, New Relic also collects data from SQL EXPLAIN. For database calls slower than a configured threshold, New Relic optionally collects runtime stack traces, which are helpful to pinpoint where in the code a database call is made. Custom parameters You can add custom parameters to your application code and record them with transaction traces to provide additional context while you are examining profiling information. Optional: For both errors and transaction traces, the HTTP request parameters can also be recorded. Security settings If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. Default security settings Depending on the agent, the default settings provide security for request parameters, HTTPS usage, and SQL: C SDK default security settings Go default security settings Java default security settings .NET default security settings Node.js default security settings PHP default security settings Python default security settings Ruby default security settings High security mode When the agent is in high security mode, default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition, high security mode applies restrictions to custom events, custom instrumentation, user attributes, exception messages, or message queue parameters, depending on the agent: C SDK: n/a Go high security mode settings Java high security mode settings .NET high security mode settings Node.js high security mode settings PHP high security mode settings Python high security mode settings Ruby high security mode settings Custom security settings If you want custom security settings, you can customize the configuration file, change custom attribute settings, or use the API, depending on your agent: C SDK custom security settings Go custom security settings Java custom security settings .NET custom security mode settings Node.js custom security settings PHP custom security settings Python custom security settings Ruby custom security settings Data received by New Relic This information applies to all APM agents no matter what security settings you have applied. Important Other data that New Relic receives is specific to the security settings for each agent. Data Captured? APM agent language version OS type and version System properties Average response time of transactions in your app URL hits Client IP address Not captured TLS and SSL Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. APM agents enable SSL by default. To verify which release includes SSL by default and to ensure that you have the most up-to-date version, refer to your agent's release notes: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby The configuration file also includes an optional flag (ssl) to enable or disable SSL using HTTPS. New Relic does not do host authentication with HTTPS, just communication encryption. Exception: You cannot disable SSL for the C SDK. The C SDK daemon can only connect with SSL. New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the REST API. This includes both inbound and outbound traffic. If your REST API call uses HTTP, or if you have disabled SSL in your configuration file, change your script or program to HTTPS. Data transmission Under Java, .NET and PHP, New Relic uses JSON to serialize data. The Ruby agent uses either Ruby marshaling or JSON serialization to send data to New Relic, depending on whether a native JSON encoder is available in under the Ruby version the agent is running on. For required changes when you want to create firewall rules to allow the agent to communicate, see Networks. For more information about security measures for your data in transit to New Relic or at rest in our storage, see Data encryption. Proxies Optional settings are available so that you can configure the agent to communicate through a proxy. To define proxy settings for host, port, domain, user, or password, refer to your agent's configuration file documentation: Agent Proxy settings C SDK -proxy at daemon startup Go transport Java Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_password proxy_port proxy_user .NET proxy element Node.js proxy PHP newrelic.daemon.proxy or the daemon's proxy setting Python proxy settings Ruby Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_port proxy_user proxy_pass",

      "body": "Apdex is an industry standard to measure users' satisfaction with the response time of web applications and services. It's a simplified Service Level Agreement (SLA) solution that helps you see how satisfied users are with your app through metrics such as Apdex score and dissatisfaction percentage instead of easily skewed traditional metrics such as average response time. Apdex measurements Apdex is a measure of response time based against a set threshold. It measures the ratio of satisfactory response times to unsatisfactory response times. The response time is measured from an asset request to completed delivery back to the requestor. After you define a response time threshold T, all responses handled in T or less time satisfy the user. For example, if T is 1.2 seconds and a response completes in 0.5 seconds, then the user is satisfied. All responses greater than 1.2 seconds dissatisfy the user. Responses greater than 4.8 seconds frustrate the user. You can define multiple Apdex T values for each of these: Apdex measurements Comments APM apps APM monitors the performance of these apps. To define their Apdex settings, use the APM UI. You can find Apdex on the APM Summary page and the Browser Summary page. Browser apps Browser monitors the end-user experience for these apps. To define end-user Apdex settings for these apps, use the Browser UI. New Relic labels them as End user on the APM Overview page and the Browser Overview page. Key transactions These are transactions important to your business that you choose to monitor. You can define Apdex settings for key transactions on the Key transactions page. Important The key transaction Apdex setting overrides the T value of that app. For details, see Key transaction Apdex. Apdex levels Apdex tracks three response counts: Satisfied: The response time is less than or equal to T. Tolerating: The response time is greater than T and less than or equal to 4T. In this example, 4 x 1.2 = 4.8 seconds is the maximum tolerable response time. Frustrated: The response time is greater than 4T or the request returns a server-side error. A high error rate can cause you to have a satisfying average response time, yet a poor Apdex score. Your configuration file's apdex_f value is four times your app server's Apdex T value. This threshold is useful, for example, with transaction traces. For more information, see the configuration file documentation for your New Relic agent. The time calculation will change based on your own app's T setting. In the following example, T = 1.2 seconds. Level Multiplier Time (T Example = 1.2) Satisfied T or less < = 1.2 seconds Tolerated > T, < = 4T Between 1.2 and 4.8 seconds Frustrated > 4T Greater than 4.8 seconds After you define your Apdex levels, use any of New Relic's resources to help identify and troubleshoot changes that indicate poor customer experiences with your app. Apdex score The Apdex score is a ratio value of the number of satisfied and tolerating requests to the total requests made. Each satisfied request counts as one request, while each tolerating request counts as half a satisfied request. An Apdex score varies from 0 to 1, with 0 as the worst possible score (100% of response times were Frustrated), and 1 as the best possible score (100% of response times were Satisfied). Example Apdex score: During a 2 minute period a host handles 200 requests. The Apdex threshold T = 0.5 seconds (500ms). This value is arbitrary and is selected by the user. 170 of the requests were handled within 500ms, so they are classified as Satisfied. 20 of the requests were handled between 500ms and 2 seconds (2000 ms), so they are classified as Tolerating. The remaining 10 were not handled properly or took longer than 2 seconds, so they are classified as Frustrated. The resulting Apdex score is 0.9: (170 + (20/2))/200 = 0.9. Important The formula used for calculating the Apdex score is designed for high-throughput apps. If your app's throughput is less than 100 RPM, not enough data is collected to determine a stable score. The instability may result in Apdex alert conditions behaving unexpectedly. Errors pages Any request that returns a server-side error such as 500: Application Error is a frustrating response, regardless of its return speed. You can use Apdex to visualize the impact of these errors, and then identify and resolve these errors with New Relic's built-in error analytics and error profile tools. Dissatisfaction percentage The dissatisfaction percentage is the percentage of the total dissatisfaction experienced by the app's users that is contributed by this transaction. Example Apdex dissatisfaction calculation: Frustrations(Transaction) + Tolerations(Transaction)/2 Frustrations(App) + Tolerations(App)/2 To visualize dissatisfaction percentage, you can sort your transactions by most dissatisfying. If a transaction is always frustratingly slow but rarely visited, it will not contribute much to the app's total dissatisfaction. Conversely, if a transaction is normally fast, but has high throughput, this may contribute a large proportion of the app's dissatisfaction simply because it contributes a large proportion of your app's traffic.",

Our APM agents give you real-time observability matched with trending data about your application's performance and the user experience. Agents reveal what is happening deep in your code with end to end transaction tracing and a variety of color-coded charts and reports. Tip To use APM and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Identify problems before your users do Our APM agents report and store the state of your application so you can quickly identify potential problems before they affect your end users. With APM, your DevOps teams don't need to guess whether a performance blocker comes from the app itself, CPU availability, database loads, or something entirely unexpected. Use our APM solutions to gather both current and historical information about memory usage, CPU utilization, database query performance, web browser rendering performance, app availability, error analysis, external services, and other useful metrics. We have agents for Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby, as well as a C SDK. Monitor all aspects of your business Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use our New Relic Explorer. Take advantage of these APM features, and more: Features Description App performance at a glance When you sign in to APM and select an app for your account, use the Summary page to quickly examine relationships across different aspects of your environment; for example: Web transactions response time: Where is the most time being spent? In the request queue, during different stages of page rendering and execution, from external services, or something else? Transaction traces: Which transactions are the slowest, and why? Error rate and throughput: What relationship is there between a spike in errors or slower throughput for a particular time period? Was there a deployment or outage at that time? Hosts: What kind of impact does this have on CPU usage, memory, etc.? Apdex: How are these events affecting customers' satisfaction with the site? Web and non-web transactions Start by comparing the top twenty web transactions or non-web transactions in terms of most time consuming, slowest average response time, highest throughput, or worst Apdex. From there, drill down into deeper trace levels for individual transactions, which in turn break down into smaller segments and components, from HTTPS requests on down to SQL queries. Want to explore even deeper? Set up distributed tracing to see how requests move across a distributed system. Select the transactions that are most important to your business (key transactions). APM and Infrastructure When your APM and Infrastructure accounts are linked, you will have access to APM data charts on these Infrastructure UI pages: Hosts, Network, Storage, and Processes. Distributed tracing Distributed tracing gives you visibility across distributed systems, showing you the path of a request as it travels between services. This feature is especially valuable for large, distributed systems that rely on many small services and microservices. Logs Bring your logs and APM agent data together to see logs associated with various objects in the New Relic UI such as applications, APM errors, APM traces, and Kubernetes containers. Service maps APM's service maps show your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. You can create and customize service maps to visualize and monitor your complex architectures. Query your data You can query and visualize your data: Sample and search APM transaction and error data to gain full understanding of the data being collected. Browse your data visually with the data explorer. Create custom SQL-like queries of your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL), or using our PromQL-style queries. Use dashboards to build advanced data visualizations, contextualize data, and understand what's going on in your system, real-time. These are just a few of APM's features.

      "body": "The APM agent that you installed receives data from your applications. The default data retention is based on your pricing edition. New Relic's default security settings automatically work to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You can also change these settings. Disclosure and audit Our APM agent is a publicly accessible plugin for web applications. The agent does not do any dynamic code generation while communicating with your app, so using the agent will not introduce any code into your application without your knowledge. Most of our agents are open source, so you can see what our code does: C SDK Go .NET Node.js Python Ruby Data collection Using a JSON message format, data the agent receives from your app is posted once a minute to the New Relic user interface. The website returns a JSON response to the agent, indicating if the data was correctly received or if there was an error. New Relic collects the following aggregate metric data: Database activity External web service calls Controller and dispatch activity View activity Uncaught exceptions and counts Process memory and CPU usage This aggregate metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and various response time statistics (average, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation). In New Relic, you will see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. New Relic optionally collects: Data collection Comments Uncaught errors New Relic captures the error as well as a runtime stack trace of the offending code. Transaction traces These are snapshots of a single transaction. As an option, the agent can also collect the query statements called within the transaction. The default collection uses obfuscation to hide any strings or numbers from the query. For transactions slower than a threshold you set, New Relic also collects data from SQL EXPLAIN. For database calls slower than a configured threshold, New Relic optionally collects runtime stack traces, which are helpful to pinpoint where in the code a database call is made. Custom parameters You can add custom parameters to your application code and record them with transaction traces to provide additional context while you are examining profiling information. Optional: For both errors and transaction traces, the HTTP request parameters can also be recorded. Security settings If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. Default security settings Depending on the agent, the default settings provide security for request parameters, HTTPS usage, and SQL: C SDK default security settings Go default security settings Java default security settings .NET default security settings Node.js default security settings PHP default security settings Python default security settings Ruby default security settings High security mode When the agent is in high security mode, default settings are locked so that users cannot change them.

Important Other data that New Relic receives is specific to the security settings for each agent. Data Captured? APM agent language version OS type and version System properties Average response time of transactions in your app URL hits Client IP address Not captured TLS and SSL Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. APM agents enable SSL by default. To verify which release includes SSL by default and to ensure that you have the most up-to-date version, refer to your agent's release notes: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby The configuration file also includes an optional flag (ssl) to enable or disable SSL using HTTPS. New Relic does not do host authentication with HTTPS, just communication encryption. Exception: You cannot disable SSL for the C SDK. The C SDK daemon can only connect with SSL. New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the REST API. This includes both inbound and outbound traffic. If your REST API call uses HTTP, or if you have disabled SSL in your configuration file, change your script or program to HTTPS. Data transmission Under Java, .NET and PHP, New Relic uses JSON to serialize data. The Ruby agent uses either Ruby marshaling or JSON serialization to send data to New Relic, depending on whether a native JSON encoder is available in under the Ruby version the agent is running on. For required changes when you want to create firewall rules to allow the agent to communicate, see Networks. For more information about security measures for your data in transit to New Relic or at rest in our storage, see Data encryption. Proxies Optional settings are available so that you can configure the agent to communicate through a proxy. To define proxy settings for host, port, domain, user, or password, refer to your agent's configuration file documentation: Agent Proxy settings C SDK -proxy at daemon startup Go transport Java Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_password proxy_port proxy_user .NET proxy element Node.js proxy PHP newrelic.daemon.proxy or the daemon's proxy setting Python proxy settings Ruby Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_port proxy_user proxy_pass",

This allows you to manage alert policies and conditions that focus on the metrics for entities (such as apps or key transactions in APM) that you care about the most. After you set up one or more alert policies and define alert conditions for your New Relic product entities (targets), you can view that information in the Alerts UI. You can also view alert policy information in the UI for individual New Relic products. View policies and conditions from APM To view alert policy and condition information for a specific app or key transaction directly from APM: Do one of the following: App: Go to one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Settings > Alert conditions. Key transaction: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Key transactions > (select a key transaction) > Settings > Alert conditions. From the Alert conditions page, use the available tools to search, sort, view, or update the alert conditions and their associated policies. View events and activities from APM Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer. To view summary information about events and other activity directly from APM: Do one of the following: App: Go to one.newrelic.com. Key transaction: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Key transactions. From the index, mouse over the entity's color-coded health status, select a link from the Application activity list, or select a specific browser app or key transaction to view additional details. For example, if a Critical alert violation occurs: The health status indicator turns red on the APM index and on the selected app. The background color for various charts changes to pink. The Application activity list on the APM index and on the selected app's Summary page shows Warning (yellow) and Critical (red) violations as applicable. To learn more about the violation in Alerts, mouse over or select any pink area on a chart. For more information and examples, see View events from their products. View alert violations from APM If an alert condition has thresholds set up for Warning (yellow) or Critical (red) violations, the color-coded health status for an entity will change to indicate a violation. You can view the violations directly from the page for the app or key transaction in APM: Do one of the following: App: Go to one.newrelic.com > (select an app) > Events > Violations.

      "body": "Application performance monitoring (APM) provides monitoring of your web or non-web application's performance. APM supports apps using several programming languages. Our APM agents give you real-time observability matched with trending data about your application's performance and the user experience. Agents reveal what is happening deep in your code with end to end transaction tracing and a variety of color-coded charts and reports. Tip To use APM and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Identify problems before your users do Our APM agents report and store the state of your application so you can quickly identify potential problems before they affect your end users. With APM, your DevOps teams don't need to guess whether a performance blocker comes from the app itself, CPU availability, database loads, or something entirely unexpected. Use our APM solutions to gather both current and historical information about memory usage, CPU utilization, database query performance, web browser rendering performance, app availability, error analysis, external services, and other useful metrics. We have agents for Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby, as well as a C SDK. Monitor all aspects of your business Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use our New Relic Explorer. Take advantage of these APM features, and more: Features Description App performance at a glance When you sign in to APM and select an app for your account, use the Summary page to quickly examine relationships across different aspects of your environment; for example: Web transactions response time: Where is the most time being spent? In the request queue, during different stages of page rendering and execution, from external services, or something else? Transaction traces: Which transactions are the slowest, and why? Error rate and throughput: What relationship is there between a spike in errors or slower throughput for a particular time period? Was there a deployment or outage at that time? Hosts: What kind of impact does this have on CPU usage, memory, etc.? Apdex: How are these events affecting customers' satisfaction with the site? Web and non-web transactions Start by comparing the top twenty web transactions or non-web transactions in terms of most time consuming, slowest average response time, highest throughput, or worst Apdex. From there, drill down into deeper trace levels for individual transactions, which in turn break down into smaller segments and components, from HTTPS requests on down to SQL queries. Want to explore even deeper? Set up distributed tracing to see how requests move across a distributed system. Select the transactions that are most important to your business (key transactions). APM and Infrastructure When your APM and Infrastructure accounts are linked, you will have access to APM data charts on these Infrastructure UI pages: Hosts, Network, Storage, and Processes. Distributed tracing Distributed tracing gives you visibility across distributed systems, showing you the path of a request as it travels between services. This feature is especially valuable for large, distributed systems that rely on many small services and microservices. Logs Bring your logs and APM agent data together to see logs associated with various objects in the New Relic UI such as applications, APM errors, APM traces, and Kubernetes containers. Service maps APM's service maps show your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. You can create and customize service maps to visualize and monitor your complex architectures. Query your data You can query and visualize your data: Sample and search APM transaction and error data to gain full understanding of the data being collected. Browse your data visually with the data explorer. Create custom SQL-like queries of your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL), or using our PromQL-style queries. Use dashboards to build advanced data visualizations, contextualize data, and understand what's going on in your system, real-time. These are just a few of APM's features. To find out more, see the table of contents for APM. Ready to get started? Start benefiting from APM in 5 simple steps (and just a few minutes!). Sign up for a New Relic account.

      "body": "Deploying an app can be a risky event—when your app breaks, a bad deployment is often the cause. New Relic allows you to track deployments so you can correlate deploy to your app's performance. Tracking deployments creates deployment markers that appear in APM charts. Options for tracking deployments You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record new deployments, retrieve a list of past deployments, and delete past deployments on your APM application. In addition, some APM agents have agent-specific methods to record deployments automatically. You can use your Slack integration with New Relic, or a simple webhook, to notify your team in real time of deployments for applications monitored by APM. Slack provides a webhook URL that allows you to post generic JSON that will appear formatted in a chosen Slack channel. There are a few places where you can view deployments in the New Relic UI after they have been recorded. You can view deployments in the UI: In the activity feed of the APM Summary, New Relic One Service summary, and entity summary pages. On APM performance charts as a chart marker. On the Deployments page for summary performance. Tip Deployment markers are not available for Browser applications, but see Browser releases for a way to tag errors with release versions. Record deployments with the REST API You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record deployments, get a list of past deployments, and delete deployments. The examples in this document use curl as a command line tool. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. You can also create, view, and delete deployments with the API Explorer. JSON uses double quotes \" for element names and content. Using single quotes ' will cause errors. Record a deployment with POST To record a new deployment, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. For example: curl -X POST \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \\ '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy Record a deployment with PowerShell To record a deployment with PowerShell, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. This example uses PowerShell version 3 or higher: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json -Method POST -Headers @{'Api-Key'='$API_KEY'} -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy This example uses PowerShell version 2 (requires .NET framework 3.5 or higher): $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding(\"ASCII\") $data ='{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' $postData = $encoding.GetBytes($data) $request = [System.Net.WebRequest]::Create('https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json') $request.Method = 'POST' $request.Headers.add('Api-Key','$API_KEY') $request.ContentType='application/json' $stream = $request.GetRequestStream() $stream.Write($postData,0,$postData.Length) $request.GetResponse() Copy View a list of deployments with GET To retrieve a list of all past deployments for your app, send a GET request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. GET requests do not use a JSON payload. For example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Sample output from GET This example requests a list of deployments for app ID 9999999: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/9999999/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx\" \\ -i Copy The API returns this list of deployments: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ETag: \"ABCDEFGHIJKabcdefghijk0123456789\" Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate Content-Type: application/json { \"deployments\": [ { \"id\": 1234567, \"revision\": \"1234123412341234123412341234123412341234\", \"changelog\": \"Fixed the bugs for real this time\", \"description\": \"Example description two\", \"user\": \"Data Nerd\", \"timestamp\": \"2016-02-24T10:09:27-08:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } }, { \"id\": 2345678, \"revision\": \"7890789078907890789078907890789078907890\", \"changelog\": \"Think I fixed all the bugs\", \"description\": null, \"user\": \"Dren Atad\", \"timestamp\": \"2014-10-22T12:23:47-07:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } } ], \"links\": { \"deployment.agent\": \"/v2/applications/{application_id}\" } } Copy Delete a deployment with DELETE To delete a deployment, send a DELETE request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. DELETE requests do not use a JSON payload, but you must specify the ID for the deployment you want to delete. To retrieve the ID for a deployment, use the GET request. For example: curl -X DELETE \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments/$DEPLOYMENT_ID.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Character limits and JSON parameters The JSON payload can include the following parameters. Important UTF-8 4 byte characters, such as Emojis and some non-Latin language glyphs, cannot be used in the deployment text. Parameter Data type Description revision String, 127 character maximum Required. A unique ID for this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. Can be any string, but is usually a version number or a Git checksum. changelog String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A summary of what changed in this deployment, visible in the Deployments page when you select (selected deployment) > Change log. description String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A high-level description of this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page when you select an individual deployment. user String, 31 character maximum Optional. A username to associate with the deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. timestamp ISO 8601 Optional. When the deployment occurred, down to the second. If not specified, the deployment will be recorded at the time when the API call was received. Timestamp requirements: Must be in UTC time. Must be after the most recent deployment timestamp. Cannot be in the future. Must be in ISO8601 format; for example, \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\". Record deployments using the New Relic agent Some agents have additional methods to record deployments: All agents: Use the New Relic REST API v2. C: No SDK-specific methods. Use the REST API. Go: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. Java: Call the Java agent jar. .NET: Use PowerShell and the REST API. Node.js: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. PHP: Use a PHP script. Python: Use the record-deploy subcommand of the newrelic-admin script. Ruby: Use a Capistrano recipe. Notify your team of deployments After a deployment is recorded using the REST API, you can optionally notify a webhook endpoint of the deployment. The destination of the webhook can be your Slack instance. To use webhooks to set up a deployment notification for a Slack channel: Log in to your Slack account as an admin, then go to App directory > Manage > Apps. Search for your New Relic app, then select Add configuration. From Post to channel, select an existing Slack channel or add a new channel, then Add configuration. From the list of options, copy the webhook URL. Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Integrations > Deploy notifications > Webhook. Paste the Slack webhook URL, then save. Optional: Send a test message. Tip You can also use webhooks, Slack channels, and other options for alert notifications with New Relic Alerts. End of life notification: Hipchat, Campfire As of September 9, 2019, integrations with Hipchat and Campfire for APM deployment notifications will no longer be available. Recommendation: If you are still using Hipchat or Campfire, use webhooks with Slack channels instead. For more information, see the New Relic Explorers Hub post.",

New Relic's default security settings automatically work to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You can also change these settings. Disclosure and audit Our APM agent is a publicly accessible plugin for web applications. The agent does not do any dynamic code generation while communicating with your app, so using the agent will not introduce any code into your application without your knowledge. Most of our agents are open source, so you can see what our code does: C SDK Go .NET Node.js Python Ruby Data collection Using a JSON message format, data the agent receives from your app is posted once a minute to the New Relic user interface. The website returns a JSON response to the agent, indicating if the data was correctly received or if there was an error. New Relic collects the following aggregate metric data: Database activity External web service calls Controller and dispatch activity View activity Uncaught exceptions and counts Process memory and CPU usage This aggregate metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and various response time statistics (average, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation). In New Relic, you will see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. New Relic optionally collects: Data collection Comments Uncaught errors New Relic captures the error as well as a runtime stack trace of the offending code. Transaction traces These are snapshots of a single transaction. As an option, the agent can also collect the query statements called within the transaction. The default collection uses obfuscation to hide any strings or numbers from the query. For transactions slower than a threshold you set, New Relic also collects data from SQL EXPLAIN. For database calls slower than a configured threshold, New Relic optionally collects runtime stack traces, which are helpful to pinpoint where in the code a database call is made. Custom parameters You can add custom parameters to your application code and record them with transaction traces to provide additional context while you are examining profiling information. Optional: For both errors and transaction traces, the HTTP request parameters can also be recorded. Security settings If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. Default security settings Depending on the agent, the default settings provide security for request parameters, HTTPS usage, and SQL: C SDK default security settings Go default security settings Java default security settings .NET default security settings Node.js default security settings PHP default security settings Python default security settings Ruby default security settings High security mode When the agent is in high security mode, default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition, high security mode applies restrictions to custom events, custom instrumentation, user attributes, exception messages, or message queue parameters, depending on the agent: C SDK: n/a Go high security mode settings Java high security mode settings .NET high security mode settings Node.js high security mode settings PHP high security mode settings Python high security mode settings Ruby high security mode settings Custom security settings If you want custom security settings, you can customize the configuration file, change custom attribute settings, or use the API, depending on your agent: C SDK custom security settings Go custom security settings Java custom security settings .NET custom security mode settings Node.js custom security settings PHP custom security settings Python custom security settings Ruby custom security settings Data received by New Relic This information applies to all APM agents no matter what security settings you have applied. Important Other data that New Relic receives is specific to the security settings for each agent. Data Captured? APM agent language version OS type and version System properties Average response time of transactions in your app URL hits Client IP address Not captured TLS and SSL Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. APM agents enable SSL by default. To verify which release includes SSL by default and to ensure that you have the most up-to-date version, refer to your agent's release notes: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby The configuration file also includes an optional flag (ssl) to enable or disable SSL using HTTPS. New Relic does not do host authentication with HTTPS, just communication encryption. Exception: You cannot disable SSL for the C SDK. The C SDK daemon can only connect with SSL. New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the REST API. This includes both inbound and outbound traffic. If your REST API call uses HTTP, or if you have disabled SSL in your configuration file, change your script or program to HTTPS. Data transmission Under Java, .NET and PHP, New Relic uses JSON to serialize data. The Ruby agent uses either Ruby marshaling or JSON serialization to send data to New Relic, depending on whether a native JSON encoder is available in under the Ruby version the agent is running on. For required changes when you want to create firewall rules to allow the agent to communicate, see Networks. For more information about security measures for your data in transit to New Relic or at rest in our storage, see Data encryption. Proxies Optional settings are available so that you can configure the agent to communicate through a proxy. To define proxy settings for host, port, domain, user, or password, refer to your agent's configuration file documentation: Agent Proxy settings C SDK -proxy at daemon startup Go transport Java Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_password proxy_port proxy_user .NET proxy element Node.js proxy PHP newrelic.daemon.proxy or the daemon's proxy setting Python proxy settings Ruby Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_port proxy_user proxy_pass",

      "body": "Applications are automatically removed from New Relic after 93 days without sending data to our platform. Key metrics will continue to be available via the New Relic REST API, with the application name remaining reserved. For more information, see Inactive apps in New Relic One and our data retention guidelines. Before attempting to remove an app Before attempting to remove an APM, browser, or mobile app from the New Relic UI, keep in mind: You can downgrade your account to pay less or make it entirely free. To remove an app, you must have a user role with that capability. If an agent is still sending data from an app, you cannot remove an app. Remove an application from New Relic Before removing an APM, browser, or mobile application from New Relic, stop the application from sending data either by disabling the agent or by uninstalling it completely. APM applications Disable the APM agent: C SDK: Do a quick recompile and deploy. For example, surround your instrumentation in #ifdef, and set the value of YOURNAMESPACE_NEWRELIC_ENABLED with your build system. Go: Set Enabled to false. Java: Set agent_enabled to false. .NET: Set Newrelic.AgentEnabled to false. Node.js: Set agent_enabled to false. PHP: Remove or disable both the newrelic.so and newrelic-daemon components. Set newrelic.enabled to false. Python: Set monitor_mode to false. Ruby: Set agent_enabled to false. Restart the application server and wait up to ten minutes. Verify the color-coded health status for the app has turned to gray and is no longer reporting data. To remove the APM application and its browser applications, call the /applications/delete endpoint of the New Relic REST API. For example: curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID.json' \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:YOUR_API_KEY' -i Copy Browser If you've used the copy/paste method to install the browser agent, remove the JavaScript snippet from your application's pages. After 93 days, the application will be removed from New Relic. Tip If browser data continues to be reported, see our suggestions below. If your browser application is linked to an APM application, deleting the APM application also removes the browser application. Call the /applications/delete endpoint like this: curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID.json' \\ -H 'X-Api-Key:YOUR_API_KEY' -i Copy Mobile Remove all references/dependencies to the New Relic's mobile SDK/frameworks, then rebuild the application. For more information, see the iOS and Android install docs. After 93 days, the application will be removed from New Relic. Troubleshooting If you have problems removing an app, here are some possible causes and suggested solutions: You are not an admin on your full user account If you don't have proper permissions, you won't be able to remove an application. You have not waited long enough All app data must stop reporting to New Relic before you can remove that entity from New Relic. In most cases, this takes between 10-15 minutes. In rare cases, it can take a few minutes longer. Not all agents are disabled If you have multiple agents reporting data under the same UI name, then you must make sure you disable or uninstall all of the agents associated with that entity. You have problems removing your PHP app If you have a PHP app and aren't able to remove it from the UI, possible causes include: You have not disabled both components of the PHP agent. You must stop or uninstall both newrelic.so and newrelic-daemon in order to be able to remove a PHP app. For more information, see New Relic daemon processes. You have set up per-directory monitoring of your PHP app, and unexpected PHP data is reporting as the default PHP application in the New Relic UI. To fix this, change the default app name in the PHP agent config. You don't know where the app's data is coming from If you don't know where an app's data is coming from, it may be because the app's name has been changed. When an app name is changed in the UI, it does not change the underlying app name being reported; it only changes how the app name appears in the UI. To see if there is a difference between the reported name and the displayed name: From one.newrelic.com, select APM, then select an application. Scroll down to Settings and select Application. Compare the name in the Application alias field to the name in the Your application still reports as message directly beneath it. To get host information about an app you are not familiar with: From one.newrelic.com, select APM, then select an application. From the summary view, review the Servers list. Once you have identified where app data is coming from, you can remove the app from New Relic. Browser data is still reporting To remove an app from New Relic, all data must have stopped reporting, including browser monitoring data. To verify that you have disabled or uninstalled the APM agent associated with the app: Ensure that browser monitoring is disabled. If your browser monitoring script is inserted by the APM agent, turn it off from inside the UI, in the agent's config file, or in both. If you copied and pasted the monitoring JavaScript snippet in certain pages, remove that JavaScript snippet manually. Ensure all caches have been cleared that the application uses, such as host caches, CDNs, or anything else that caches built pages. Optional: To see a count of how many page views report from each domain, use this NRQL query: SELECT count(*) FROM PageView WHERE appName = 'YOUR_BROWSER_APP_NAME' FACET domain Copy If these steps don't resolve the issue, it is likely due to an end-user's browser cache that hasn't yet cleared. Wait until those caches clear. If your app has internal users, you may be able to identify the users and clear those caches. For more help",

      "body": "The APM agent that you installed receives data from your applications. The default data retention is based on your pricing edition. New Relic's default security settings automatically work to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You can also change these settings. Disclosure and audit Our APM agent is a publicly accessible plugin for web applications. The agent does not do any dynamic code generation while communicating with your app, so using the agent will not introduce any code into your application without your knowledge. Most of our agents are open source, so you can see what our code does: C SDK Go .NET Node.js Python Ruby Data collection Using a JSON message format, data the agent receives from your app is posted once a minute to the New Relic user interface. The website returns a JSON response to the agent, indicating if the data was correctly received or if there was an error. New Relic collects the following aggregate metric data: Database activity External web service calls Controller and dispatch activity View activity Uncaught exceptions and counts Process memory and CPU usage This aggregate metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and various response time statistics (average, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation). In New Relic, you will see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. New Relic optionally collects: Data collection Comments Uncaught errors New Relic captures the error as well as a runtime stack trace of the offending code. Transaction traces These are snapshots of a single transaction. As an option, the agent can also collect the query statements called within the transaction. The default collection uses obfuscation to hide any strings or numbers from the query. For transactions slower than a threshold you set, New Relic also collects data from SQL EXPLAIN. For database calls slower than a configured threshold, New Relic optionally collects runtime stack traces, which are helpful to pinpoint where in the code a database call is made. Custom parameters You can add custom parameters to your application code and record them with transaction traces to provide additional context while you are examining profiling information. Optional: For both errors and transaction traces, the HTTP request parameters can also be recorded. Security settings If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. Default security settings Depending on the agent, the default settings provide security for request parameters, HTTPS usage, and SQL: C SDK default security settings Go default security settings Java default security settings .NET default security settings Node.js default security settings PHP default security settings Python default security settings Ruby default security settings High security mode When the agent is in high security mode, default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition, high security mode applies restrictions to custom events, custom instrumentation, user attributes, exception messages, or message queue parameters, depending on the agent: C SDK: n/a Go high security mode settings Java high security mode settings .NET high security mode settings Node.js high security mode settings PHP high security mode settings Python high security mode settings Ruby high security mode settings Custom security settings If you want custom security settings, you can customize the configuration file, change custom attribute settings, or use the API, depending on your agent: C SDK custom security settings Go custom security settings Java custom security settings .NET custom security mode settings Node.js custom security settings PHP custom security settings Python custom security settings Ruby custom security settings Data received by New Relic This information applies to all APM agents no matter what security settings you have applied. Important Other data that New Relic receives is specific to the security settings for each agent. Data Captured? APM agent language version OS type and version System properties Average response time of transactions in your app URL hits Client IP address Not captured TLS and SSL Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. APM agents enable SSL by default. To verify which release includes SSL by default and to ensure that you have the most up-to-date version, refer to your agent's release notes: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby The configuration file also includes an optional flag (ssl) to enable or disable SSL using HTTPS. New Relic does not do host authentication with HTTPS, just communication encryption. Exception: You cannot disable SSL for the C SDK. The C SDK daemon can only connect with SSL. New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the REST API. This includes both inbound and outbound traffic. If your REST API call uses HTTP, or if you have disabled SSL in your configuration file, change your script or program to HTTPS. Data transmission Under Java, .NET and PHP, New Relic uses JSON to serialize data. The Ruby agent uses either Ruby marshaling or JSON serialization to send data to New Relic, depending on whether a native JSON encoder is available in under the Ruby version the agent is running on. For required changes when you want to create firewall rules to allow the agent to communicate, see Networks. For more information about security measures for your data in transit to New Relic or at rest in our storage, see Data encryption. Proxies Optional settings are available so that you can configure the agent to communicate through a proxy. To define proxy settings for host, port, domain, user, or password, refer to your agent's configuration file documentation: Agent Proxy settings C SDK -proxy at daemon startup Go transport Java Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_password proxy_port proxy_user .NET proxy element Node.js proxy PHP newrelic.daemon.proxy or the daemon's proxy setting Python proxy settings Ruby Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_port proxy_user proxy_pass",

If an agent is still sending data from an app, you cannot remove an app. Remove an application from New Relic Before removing an APM, browser, or mobile application from New Relic, stop the application from sending data either by disabling the agent or by uninstalling it completely. APM applications Disable the APM agent: C SDK: Do a quick recompile and deploy. For example, surround your instrumentation in #ifdef, and set the value of YOURNAMESPACE_NEWRELIC_ENABLED with your build system. Go: Set Enabled to false. Java: Set agent_enabled to false. .NET: Set Newrelic.AgentEnabled to false. Node.js: Set agent_enabled to false. PHP: Remove or disable both the newrelic.so and newrelic-daemon components. Set newrelic.enabled to false. Python: Set monitor_mode to false. Ruby: Set agent_enabled to false. Restart the application server and wait up to ten minutes. Verify the color-coded health status for the app has turned to gray and is no longer reporting data.

Related procedures: To permanently disable APM, uninstall the agent. To configure an agent to monitor some things but not others, use custom instrumentation. Disable the APM agent Select your agent type for instructions: C SDK The C SDK cannot be turned on or off directly. However, you can write your code for the SDK so that a quick recompile and deploy can enable or disable your instrumentation. Follow standard procedures to disable or uninstall the C SDK. Go There are two main ways to disable the Go agent: Remove the import of the github.com/newrelic/go-agent package from your application, and remove or comment out any calls to the newrelic namespace. Then, recompile and restart your app. Use the enabled configuration setting. Then, recompile and restart your app. (This will not reduce overhead because the instrumentation is still running; it will only prevent the sending of data to the New Relic collector.) Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Java There are three main ways to disable the Java agent: Set agent_enabled to false, then restart the JVM. Use the JVM command line flag: -Dnewrelic.config.agent_enabled=false Copy Then restart the JVM. Remove the newrelic.jar or newrelic.yml file, then restart the JVM. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. .NET The method to disable the agent depends on if you are using Framework or Core: .NET Framework: Set agentEnabled to false in the global newrelic.config file, found in C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\. If the application is IIS-hosted, restart IIS. If it's self-hosted (non-IIS), restart the application. .NET Core: Set agentEnabled to false in the newrelic.config file found in the Core agent’s installation directory (for Windows alongside NewRelic.Profiler.dll and for Linux alongside NewRelic.Profiler.so). If you use the ASP.NET Core Module, reset IIS. Otherwise, restart your Core application. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Node.js There are two main ways to disable the Node.js agent: Set agent_enabled to false in your agent config file, then restart the app server. Set the NEW_RELIC_ENABLED environment variable to false. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. PHP To disable the PHP agent, set the enabled config setting to false, then restart the web server or PHP. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Python There are three main ways to disable the Python agent, depending on your preference and setup: Standard install: Use the monitor_mode configuration setting. This can be done by editing the config file or by using an environment variable. Standard install with newrelic-admin script: Remove reference to that script in your application. Manual instrumentation: Remove the initialization script from your application. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Ruby There are several ways to disable the Ruby agent, depending on your preference and setup. These methods will remove most instrumentation but there will still be a small amount of activity and overhead: Use the agent_enabled configuration setting. This can be done in the configuration file or in the per-environment stanzas. Restart your app server afterward. Do the same via an environment variable, then restart the app server. The following methods will remove all instrumentation and overhead: Remove newrelic_rpm from the Gemfile and bundle install. Set the following in the Gemfile and bundle install: gem 'newrelic_rpm', :require => false Copy This option ensures the gem is installed if it's required somewhere in the app, but doesn't install it when bundling.

New Relic allows you to track deployments so you can correlate deploy to your app's performance. Tracking deployments creates deployment markers that appear in APM charts. Options for tracking deployments You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record new deployments, retrieve a list of past deployments, and delete past deployments on your APM application. In addition, some APM agents have agent-specific methods to record deployments automatically. You can use your Slack integration with New Relic, or a simple webhook, to notify your team in real time of deployments for applications monitored by APM. Slack provides a webhook URL that allows you to post generic JSON that will appear formatted in a chosen Slack channel. There are a few places where you can view deployments in the New Relic UI after they have been recorded. You can view deployments in the UI: In the activity feed of the APM Summary, New Relic One Service summary, and entity summary pages. On APM performance charts as a chart marker. On the Deployments page for summary performance. Tip Deployment markers are not available for Browser applications, but see Browser releases for a way to tag errors with release versions. Record deployments with the REST API You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record deployments, get a list of past deployments, and delete deployments. The examples in this document use curl as a command line tool. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. You can also create, view, and delete deployments with the API Explorer. JSON uses double quotes \" for element names and content. Using single quotes ' will cause errors. Record a deployment with POST To record a new deployment, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. For example: curl -X POST \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \\ '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy Record a deployment with PowerShell To record a deployment with PowerShell, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. This example uses PowerShell version 3 or higher: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json -Method POST -Headers @{'Api-Key'='$API_KEY'} -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy This example uses PowerShell version 2 (requires .NET framework 3.5 or higher): $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding(\"ASCII\") $data ='{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' $postData = $encoding.GetBytes($data) $request = [System.Net.WebRequest]::Create('https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json') $request.Method = 'POST' $request.Headers.add('Api-Key','$API_KEY') $request.ContentType='application/json' $stream = $request.GetRequestStream() $stream.Write($postData,0,$postData.Length) $request.GetResponse() Copy View a list of deployments with GET To retrieve a list of all past deployments for your app, send a GET request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. GET requests do not use a JSON payload. For example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Sample output from GET This example requests a list of deployments for app ID 9999999: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/9999999/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx\" \\ -i Copy The API returns this list of deployments: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ETag: \"ABCDEFGHIJKabcdefghijk0123456789\" Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate Content-Type: application/json { \"deployments\": [ { \"id\": 1234567, \"revision\": \"1234123412341234123412341234123412341234\", \"changelog\": \"Fixed the bugs for real this time\", \"description\": \"Example description two\", \"user\": \"Data Nerd\", \"timestamp\": \"2016-02-24T10:09:27-08:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } }, { \"id\": 2345678, \"revision\": \"7890789078907890789078907890789078907890\", \"changelog\": \"Think I fixed all the bugs\", \"description\": null, \"user\": \"Dren Atad\", \"timestamp\": \"2014-10-22T12:23:47-07:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } } ], \"links\": { \"deployment.agent\": \"/v2/applications/{application_id}\" } } Copy Delete a deployment with DELETE To delete a deployment, send a DELETE request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. DELETE requests do not use a JSON payload, but you must specify the ID for the deployment you want to delete. To retrieve the ID for a deployment, use the GET request. For example: curl -X DELETE \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments/$DEPLOYMENT_ID.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Character limits and JSON parameters The JSON payload can include the following parameters. Important UTF-8 4 byte characters, such as Emojis and some non-Latin language glyphs, cannot be used in the deployment text. Parameter Data type Description revision String, 127 character maximum Required. A unique ID for this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. Can be any string, but is usually a version number or a Git checksum. changelog String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A summary of what changed in this deployment, visible in the Deployments page when you select (selected deployment) > Change log. description String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A high-level description of this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page when you select an individual deployment. user String, 31 character maximum Optional. A username to associate with the deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. timestamp ISO 8601 Optional. When the deployment occurred, down to the second. If not specified, the deployment will be recorded at the time when the API call was received. Timestamp requirements: Must be in UTC time. Must be after the most recent deployment timestamp. Cannot be in the future. Must be in ISO8601 format; for example, \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\". Record deployments using the New Relic agent Some agents have additional methods to record deployments: All agents: Use the New Relic REST API v2. C: No SDK-specific methods. Use the REST API. Go: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. Java: Call the Java agent jar. .NET: Use PowerShell and the REST API. Node.js: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. PHP: Use a PHP script. Python: Use the record-deploy subcommand of the newrelic-admin script. Ruby: Use a Capistrano recipe. Notify your team of deployments After a deployment is recorded using the REST API, you can optionally notify a webhook endpoint of the deployment. The destination of the webhook can be your Slack instance. To use webhooks to set up a deployment notification for a Slack channel: Log in to your Slack account as an admin, then go to App directory > Manage > Apps. Search for your New Relic app, then select Add configuration. From Post to channel, select an existing Slack channel or add a new channel, then Add configuration. From the list of options, copy the webhook URL. Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Integrations > Deploy notifications > Webhook. Paste the Slack webhook URL, then save. Optional: Send a test message. Tip You can also use webhooks, Slack channels, and other options for alert notifications with New Relic Alerts. End of life notification: Hipchat, Campfire As of September 9, 2019, integrations with Hipchat and Campfire for APM deployment notifications will no longer be available. Recommendation: If you are still using Hipchat or Campfire, use webhooks with Slack channels instead. For more information, see the New Relic Explorers Hub post.",

New Relic's default security settings automatically work to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You can also change these settings. Disclosure and audit Our APM agent is a publicly accessible plugin for web applications. The agent does not do any dynamic code generation while communicating with your app, so using the agent will not introduce any code into your application without your knowledge. Most of our agents are open source, so you can see what our code does: C SDK Go .NET Node.js Python Ruby Data collection Using a JSON message format, data the agent receives from your app is posted once a minute to the New Relic user interface. The website returns a JSON response to the agent, indicating if the data was correctly received or if there was an error. New Relic collects the following aggregate metric data: Database activity External web service calls Controller and dispatch activity View activity Uncaught exceptions and counts Process memory and CPU usage This aggregate metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and various response time statistics (average, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation). In New Relic, you will see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. New Relic optionally collects: Data collection Comments Uncaught errors New Relic captures the error as well as a runtime stack trace of the offending code. Transaction traces These are snapshots of a single transaction. As an option, the agent can also collect the query statements called within the transaction. The default collection uses obfuscation to hide any strings or numbers from the query. For transactions slower than a threshold you set, New Relic also collects data from SQL EXPLAIN. For database calls slower than a configured threshold, New Relic optionally collects runtime stack traces, which are helpful to pinpoint where in the code a database call is made. Custom parameters You can add custom parameters to your application code and record them with transaction traces to provide additional context while you are examining profiling information. Optional: For both errors and transaction traces, the HTTP request parameters can also be recorded. Security settings If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. Default security settings Depending on the agent, the default settings provide security for request parameters, HTTPS usage, and SQL: C SDK default security settings Go default security settings Java default security settings .NET default security settings Node.js default security settings PHP default security settings Python default security settings Ruby default security settings High security mode When the agent is in high security mode, default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition, high security mode applies restrictions to custom events, custom instrumentation, user attributes, exception messages, or message queue parameters, depending on the agent: C SDK: n/a Go high security mode settings Java high security mode settings .NET high security mode settings Node.js high security mode settings PHP high security mode settings Python high security mode settings Ruby high security mode settings Custom security settings If you want custom security settings, you can customize the configuration file, change custom attribute settings, or use the API, depending on your agent: C SDK custom security settings Go custom security settings Java custom security settings .NET custom security mode settings Node.js custom security settings PHP custom security settings Python custom security settings Ruby custom security settings Data received by New Relic This information applies to all APM agents no matter what security settings you have applied. Important Other data that New Relic receives is specific to the security settings for each agent. Data Captured? APM agent language version OS type and version System properties Average response time of transactions in your app URL hits Client IP address Not captured TLS and SSL Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. APM agents enable SSL by default. To verify which release includes SSL by default and to ensure that you have the most up-to-date version, refer to your agent's release notes: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby The configuration file also includes an optional flag (ssl) to enable or disable SSL using HTTPS. New Relic does not do host authentication with HTTPS, just communication encryption. Exception: You cannot disable SSL for the C SDK. The C SDK daemon can only connect with SSL. New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the REST API. This includes both inbound and outbound traffic. If your REST API call uses HTTP, or if you have disabled SSL in your configuration file, change your script or program to HTTPS. Data transmission Under Java, .NET and PHP, New Relic uses JSON to serialize data. The Ruby agent uses either Ruby marshaling or JSON serialization to send data to New Relic, depending on whether a native JSON encoder is available in under the Ruby version the agent is running on. For required changes when you want to create firewall rules to allow the agent to communicate, see Networks. For more information about security measures for your data in transit to New Relic or at rest in our storage, see Data encryption. Proxies Optional settings are available so that you can configure the agent to communicate through a proxy. To define proxy settings for host, port, domain, user, or password, refer to your agent's configuration file documentation: Agent Proxy settings C SDK -proxy at daemon startup Go transport Java Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_password proxy_port proxy_user .NET proxy element Node.js proxy PHP newrelic.daemon.proxy or the daemon's proxy setting Python proxy settings Ruby Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_port proxy_user proxy_pass",

      "body": "You may want to temporarily disable an APM agent for the purposes of testing or troubleshooting. This document explains procedures for temporarily turning off the APM agent. Related procedures: To permanently disable APM, uninstall the agent. To configure an agent to monitor some things but not others, use custom instrumentation. Disable the APM agent Select your agent type for instructions: C SDK The C SDK cannot be turned on or off directly. However, you can write your code for the SDK so that a quick recompile and deploy can enable or disable your instrumentation. Follow standard procedures to disable or uninstall the C SDK. Go There are two main ways to disable the Go agent: Remove the import of the github.com/newrelic/go-agent package from your application, and remove or comment out any calls to the newrelic namespace. Then, recompile and restart your app. Use the enabled configuration setting. Then, recompile and restart your app. (This will not reduce overhead because the instrumentation is still running; it will only prevent the sending of data to the New Relic collector.) Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Java There are three main ways to disable the Java agent: Set agent_enabled to false, then restart the JVM. Use the JVM command line flag: -Dnewrelic.config.agent_enabled=false Copy Then restart the JVM. Remove the newrelic.jar or newrelic.yml file, then restart the JVM. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. .NET The method to disable the agent depends on if you are using Framework or Core: .NET Framework: Set agentEnabled to false in the global newrelic.config file, found in C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\.NET Agent\\. If the application is IIS-hosted, restart IIS. If it's self-hosted (non-IIS), restart the application. .NET Core: Set agentEnabled to false in the newrelic.config file found in the Core agent’s installation directory (for Windows alongside NewRelic.Profiler.dll and for Linux alongside NewRelic.Profiler.so). If you use the ASP.NET Core Module, reset IIS. Otherwise, restart your Core application. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Node.js There are two main ways to disable the Node.js agent: Set agent_enabled to false in your agent config file, then restart the app server. Set the NEW_RELIC_ENABLED environment variable to false. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. PHP To disable the PHP agent, set the enabled config setting to false, then restart the web server or PHP. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Python There are three main ways to disable the Python agent, depending on your preference and setup: Standard install: Use the monitor_mode configuration setting. This can be done by editing the config file or by using an environment variable. Standard install with newrelic-admin script: Remove reference to that script in your application. Manual instrumentation: Remove the initialization script from your application. Tip After you disable the agent, it may take several minutes for data to stop showing up. Ruby There are several ways to disable the Ruby agent, depending on your preference and setup. These methods will remove most instrumentation but there will still be a small amount of activity and overhead: Use the agent_enabled configuration setting. This can be done in the configuration file or in the per-environment stanzas. Restart your app server afterward. Do the same via an environment variable, then restart the app server. The following methods will remove all instrumentation and overhead: Remove newrelic_rpm from the Gemfile and bundle install. Set the following in the Gemfile and bundle install: gem 'newrelic_rpm', :require => false Copy This option ensures the gem is installed if it's required somewhere in the app, but doesn't install it when bundling.

      "body": "Deploying an app can be a risky event—when your app breaks, a bad deployment is often the cause. New Relic allows you to track deployments so you can correlate deploy to your app's performance. Tracking deployments creates deployment markers that appear in APM charts. Options for tracking deployments You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record new deployments, retrieve a list of past deployments, and delete past deployments on your APM application. In addition, some APM agents have agent-specific methods to record deployments automatically. You can use your Slack integration with New Relic, or a simple webhook, to notify your team in real time of deployments for applications monitored by APM. Slack provides a webhook URL that allows you to post generic JSON that will appear formatted in a chosen Slack channel. There are a few places where you can view deployments in the New Relic UI after they have been recorded. You can view deployments in the UI: In the activity feed of the APM Summary, New Relic One Service summary, and entity summary pages. On APM performance charts as a chart marker. On the Deployments page for summary performance. Tip Deployment markers are not available for Browser applications, but see Browser releases for a way to tag errors with release versions. Record deployments with the REST API You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record deployments, get a list of past deployments, and delete deployments. The examples in this document use curl as a command line tool. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. You can also create, view, and delete deployments with the API Explorer. JSON uses double quotes \" for element names and content. Using single quotes ' will cause errors. Record a deployment with POST To record a new deployment, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. For example: curl -X POST \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \\ '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy Record a deployment with PowerShell To record a deployment with PowerShell, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. This example uses PowerShell version 3 or higher: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json -Method POST -Headers @{'Api-Key'='$API_KEY'} -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy This example uses PowerShell version 2 (requires .NET framework 3.5 or higher): $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding(\"ASCII\") $data ='{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' $postData = $encoding.GetBytes($data) $request = [System.Net.WebRequest]::Create('https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json') $request.Method = 'POST' $request.Headers.add('Api-Key','$API_KEY') $request.ContentType='application/json' $stream = $request.GetRequestStream() $stream.Write($postData,0,$postData.Length) $request.GetResponse() Copy View a list of deployments with GET To retrieve a list of all past deployments for your app, send a GET request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. GET requests do not use a JSON payload. For example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Sample output from GET This example requests a list of deployments for app ID 9999999: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/9999999/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx\" \\ -i Copy The API returns this list of deployments: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ETag: \"ABCDEFGHIJKabcdefghijk0123456789\" Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate Content-Type: application/json { \"deployments\": [ { \"id\": 1234567, \"revision\": \"1234123412341234123412341234123412341234\", \"changelog\": \"Fixed the bugs for real this time\", \"description\": \"Example description two\", \"user\": \"Data Nerd\", \"timestamp\": \"2016-02-24T10:09:27-08:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } }, { \"id\": 2345678, \"revision\": \"7890789078907890789078907890789078907890\", \"changelog\": \"Think I fixed all the bugs\", \"description\": null, \"user\": \"Dren Atad\", \"timestamp\": \"2014-10-22T12:23:47-07:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } } ], \"links\": { \"deployment.agent\": \"/v2/applications/{application_id}\" } } Copy Delete a deployment with DELETE To delete a deployment, send a DELETE request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. DELETE requests do not use a JSON payload, but you must specify the ID for the deployment you want to delete. To retrieve the ID for a deployment, use the GET request. For example: curl -X DELETE \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments/$DEPLOYMENT_ID.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Character limits and JSON parameters The JSON payload can include the following parameters. Important UTF-8 4 byte characters, such as Emojis and some non-Latin language glyphs, cannot be used in the deployment text. Parameter Data type Description revision String, 127 character maximum Required. A unique ID for this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. Can be any string, but is usually a version number or a Git checksum. changelog String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A summary of what changed in this deployment, visible in the Deployments page when you select (selected deployment) > Change log. description String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A high-level description of this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page when you select an individual deployment. user String, 31 character maximum Optional. A username to associate with the deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. timestamp ISO 8601 Optional. When the deployment occurred, down to the second. If not specified, the deployment will be recorded at the time when the API call was received. Timestamp requirements: Must be in UTC time. Must be after the most recent deployment timestamp. Cannot be in the future. Must be in ISO8601 format; for example, \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\". Record deployments using the New Relic agent Some agents have additional methods to record deployments: All agents: Use the New Relic REST API v2. C: No SDK-specific methods. Use the REST API. Go: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. Java: Call the Java agent jar. .NET: Use PowerShell and the REST API. Node.js: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. PHP: Use a PHP script. Python: Use the record-deploy subcommand of the newrelic-admin script. Ruby: Use a Capistrano recipe. Notify your team of deployments After a deployment is recorded using the REST API, you can optionally notify a webhook endpoint of the deployment. The destination of the webhook can be your Slack instance. To use webhooks to set up a deployment notification for a Slack channel: Log in to your Slack account as an admin, then go to App directory > Manage > Apps. Search for your New Relic app, then select Add configuration. From Post to channel, select an existing Slack channel or add a new channel, then Add configuration. From the list of options, copy the webhook URL. Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Integrations > Deploy notifications > Webhook. Paste the Slack webhook URL, then save. Optional: Send a test message. Tip You can also use webhooks, Slack channels, and other options for alert notifications with New Relic Alerts. End of life notification: Hipchat, Campfire As of September 9, 2019, integrations with Hipchat and Campfire for APM deployment notifications will no longer be available. Recommendation: If you are still using Hipchat or Campfire, use webhooks with Slack channels instead. For more information, see the New Relic Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "The APM agent that you installed receives data from your applications. The default data retention is based on your pricing edition. New Relic's default security settings automatically work to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You can also change these settings. Disclosure and audit Our APM agent is a publicly accessible plugin for web applications. The agent does not do any dynamic code generation while communicating with your app, so using the agent will not introduce any code into your application without your knowledge. Most of our agents are open source, so you can see what our code does: C SDK Go .NET Node.js Python Ruby Data collection Using a JSON message format, data the agent receives from your app is posted once a minute to the New Relic user interface. The website returns a JSON response to the agent, indicating if the data was correctly received or if there was an error. New Relic collects the following aggregate metric data: Database activity External web service calls Controller and dispatch activity View activity Uncaught exceptions and counts Process memory and CPU usage This aggregate metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and various response time statistics (average, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation). In New Relic, you will see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. New Relic optionally collects: Data collection Comments Uncaught errors New Relic captures the error as well as a runtime stack trace of the offending code. Transaction traces These are snapshots of a single transaction. As an option, the agent can also collect the query statements called within the transaction. The default collection uses obfuscation to hide any strings or numbers from the query. For transactions slower than a threshold you set, New Relic also collects data from SQL EXPLAIN. For database calls slower than a configured threshold, New Relic optionally collects runtime stack traces, which are helpful to pinpoint where in the code a database call is made. Custom parameters You can add custom parameters to your application code and record them with transaction traces to provide additional context while you are examining profiling information. Optional: For both errors and transaction traces, the HTTP request parameters can also be recorded. Security settings If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. Default security settings Depending on the agent, the default settings provide security for request parameters, HTTPS usage, and SQL: C SDK default security settings Go default security settings Java default security settings .NET default security settings Node.js default security settings PHP default security settings Python default security settings Ruby default security settings High security mode When the agent is in high security mode, default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition, high security mode applies restrictions to custom events, custom instrumentation, user attributes, exception messages, or message queue parameters, depending on the agent: C SDK: n/a Go high security mode settings Java high security mode settings .NET high security mode settings Node.js high security mode settings PHP high security mode settings Python high security mode settings Ruby high security mode settings Custom security settings If you want custom security settings, you can customize the configuration file, change custom attribute settings, or use the API, depending on your agent: C SDK custom security settings Go custom security settings Java custom security settings .NET custom security mode settings Node.js custom security settings PHP custom security settings Python custom security settings Ruby custom security settings Data received by New Relic This information applies to all APM agents no matter what security settings you have applied. Important Other data that New Relic receives is specific to the security settings for each agent. Data Captured? APM agent language version OS type and version System properties Average response time of transactions in your app URL hits Client IP address Not captured TLS and SSL Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. APM agents enable SSL by default. To verify which release includes SSL by default and to ensure that you have the most up-to-date version, refer to your agent's release notes: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby The configuration file also includes an optional flag (ssl) to enable or disable SSL using HTTPS. New Relic does not do host authentication with HTTPS, just communication encryption. Exception: You cannot disable SSL for the C SDK. The C SDK daemon can only connect with SSL. New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the REST API. This includes both inbound and outbound traffic. If your REST API call uses HTTP, or if you have disabled SSL in your configuration file, change your script or program to HTTPS. Data transmission Under Java, .NET and PHP, New Relic uses JSON to serialize data. The Ruby agent uses either Ruby marshaling or JSON serialization to send data to New Relic, depending on whether a native JSON encoder is available in under the Ruby version the agent is running on. For required changes when you want to create firewall rules to allow the agent to communicate, see Networks. For more information about security measures for your data in transit to New Relic or at rest in our storage, see Data encryption. Proxies Optional settings are available so that you can configure the agent to communicate through a proxy. To define proxy settings for host, port, domain, user, or password, refer to your agent's configuration file documentation: Agent Proxy settings C SDK -proxy at daemon startup Go transport Java Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_password proxy_port proxy_user .NET proxy element Node.js proxy PHP newrelic.daemon.proxy or the daemon's proxy setting Python proxy settings Ruby Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_port proxy_user proxy_pass",

On the Deployments page for summary performance. Tip Deployment markers are not available for Browser applications, but see Browser releases for a way to tag errors with release versions. Record deployments with the REST API You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record deployments, get a list of past deployments, and delete deployments. The examples in this document use curl as a command line tool. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. You can also create, view, and delete deployments with the API Explorer. JSON uses double quotes \" for element names and content. Using single quotes ' will cause errors. Record a deployment with POST To record a new deployment, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. For example: curl -X POST \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -d \\ '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy Record a deployment with PowerShell To record a deployment with PowerShell, send a POST request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see Character limits and JSON parameters). All payload parameters are optional except revision. This example uses PowerShell version 3 or higher: Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json -Method POST -Headers @{'Api-Key'='$API_KEY'} -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' Copy This example uses PowerShell version 2 (requires .NET framework 3.5 or higher): $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding(\"ASCII\") $data ='{ \"deployment\": { \"revision\": \"REVISION\", \"changelog\": \"Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None\", \"description\": \"Added a deployments resource to the v2 API\", \"user\": \"datanerd@example.com\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\" } }' $postData = $encoding.GetBytes($data) $request = [System.Net.WebRequest]::Create('https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json') $request.Method = 'POST' $request.Headers.add('Api-Key','$API_KEY') $request.ContentType='application/json' $stream = $request.GetRequestStream() $stream.Write($postData,0,$postData.Length) $request.GetResponse() Copy View a list of deployments with GET To retrieve a list of all past deployments for your app, send a GET request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. GET requests do not use a JSON payload. For example: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Sample output from GET This example requests a list of deployments for app ID 9999999: curl -X GET \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/9999999/deployments.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx\" \\ -i Copy The API returns this list of deployments: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ETag: \"ABCDEFGHIJKabcdefghijk0123456789\" Cache-Control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate Content-Type: application/json { \"deployments\": [ { \"id\": 1234567, \"revision\": \"1234123412341234123412341234123412341234\", \"changelog\": \"Fixed the bugs for real this time\", \"description\": \"Example description two\", \"user\": \"Data Nerd\", \"timestamp\": \"2016-02-24T10:09:27-08:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } }, { \"id\": 2345678, \"revision\": \"7890789078907890789078907890789078907890\", \"changelog\": \"Think I fixed all the bugs\", \"description\": null, \"user\": \"Dren Atad\", \"timestamp\": \"2014-10-22T12:23:47-07:00\", \"links\": { \"application\": 9999999 } } ], \"links\": { \"deployment.agent\": \"/v2/applications/{application_id}\" } } Copy Delete a deployment with DELETE To delete a deployment, send a DELETE request that includes your API key to the deployments endpoint. DELETE requests do not use a JSON payload, but you must specify the ID for the deployment you want to delete. To retrieve the ID for a deployment, use the GET request. For example: curl -X DELETE \"https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments/$DEPLOYMENT_ID.json\" \\ -H \"Api-Key:$API_KEY\" \\ -i Copy Character limits and JSON parameters The JSON payload can include the following parameters. Important UTF-8 4 byte characters, such as Emojis and some non-Latin language glyphs, cannot be used in the deployment text. Parameter Data type Description revision String, 127 character maximum Required. A unique ID for this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. Can be any string, but is usually a version number or a Git checksum. changelog String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A summary of what changed in this deployment, visible in the Deployments page when you select (selected deployment) > Change log. description String, 65535 character maximum Optional. A high-level description of this deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page when you select an individual deployment. user String, 31 character maximum Optional. A username to associate with the deployment, visible in the Summary page and on the Deployments page. timestamp ISO 8601 Optional. When the deployment occurred, down to the second. If not specified, the deployment will be recorded at the time when the API call was received. Timestamp requirements: Must be in UTC time. Must be after the most recent deployment timestamp. Cannot be in the future. Must be in ISO8601 format; for example, \"2019-10-08T00:15:36Z\". Record deployments using the New Relic agent Some agents have additional methods to record deployments: All agents: Use the New Relic REST API v2. C: No SDK-specific methods. Use the REST API. Go: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. Java: Call the Java agent jar. .NET: Use PowerShell and the REST API. Node.js: No agent-specific methods. Use the REST API. PHP: Use a PHP script. Python: Use the record-deploy subcommand of the newrelic-admin script. Ruby: Use a Capistrano recipe. Notify your team of deployments After a deployment is recorded using the REST API, you can optionally notify a webhook endpoint of the deployment. The destination of the webhook can be your Slack instance. To use webhooks to set up a deployment notification for a Slack channel: Log in to your Slack account as an admin, then go to App directory > Manage > Apps. Search for your New Relic app, then select Add configuration. From Post to channel, select an existing Slack channel or add a new channel, then Add configuration. From the list of options, copy the webhook URL. Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Integrations > Deploy notifications > Webhook. Paste the Slack webhook URL, then save. Optional: Send a test message. Tip You can also use webhooks, Slack channels, and other options for alert notifications with New Relic Alerts. End of life notification: Hipchat, Campfire As of September 9, 2019, integrations with Hipchat and Campfire for APM deployment notifications will no longer be available. Recommendation: If you are still using Hipchat or Campfire, use webhooks with Slack channels instead. For more information, see the New Relic Explorers Hub post.",

      "body": "The APM agent that you installed receives data from your applications. The default data retention is based on your pricing edition. New Relic's default security settings automatically work to ensure data privacy and to limit the kind of information New Relic receives. You can also change these settings. Disclosure and audit Our APM agent is a publicly accessible plugin for web applications. The agent does not do any dynamic code generation while communicating with your app, so using the agent will not introduce any code into your application without your knowledge. Most of our agents are open source, so you can see what our code does: C SDK Go .NET Node.js Python Ruby Data collection Using a JSON message format, data the agent receives from your app is posted once a minute to the New Relic user interface. The website returns a JSON response to the agent, indicating if the data was correctly received or if there was an error. New Relic collects the following aggregate metric data: Database activity External web service calls Controller and dispatch activity View activity Uncaught exceptions and counts Process memory and CPU usage This aggregate metric data summarizes calls to specific methods in your application: how many times each one was called and various response time statistics (average, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation). In New Relic, you will see the class and method names along with their aggregate numbers. New Relic optionally collects: Data collection Comments Uncaught errors New Relic captures the error as well as a runtime stack trace of the offending code. Transaction traces These are snapshots of a single transaction. As an option, the agent can also collect the query statements called within the transaction. The default collection uses obfuscation to hide any strings or numbers from the query. For transactions slower than a threshold you set, New Relic also collects data from SQL EXPLAIN. For database calls slower than a configured threshold, New Relic optionally collects runtime stack traces, which are helpful to pinpoint where in the code a database call is made. Custom parameters You can add custom parameters to your application code and record them with transaction traces to provide additional context while you are examining profiling information. Optional: For both errors and transaction traces, the HTTP request parameters can also be recorded. Security settings If you want to restrict the information that New Relic receives, you can enable high security mode. If high security mode or the default settings do not work for your business needs, you can apply custom settings. Default security settings Depending on the agent, the default settings provide security for request parameters, HTTPS usage, and SQL: C SDK default security settings Go default security settings Java default security settings .NET default security settings Node.js default security settings PHP default security settings Python default security settings Ruby default security settings High security mode When the agent is in high security mode, default settings are locked so that users cannot change them. In addition, high security mode applies restrictions to custom events, custom instrumentation, user attributes, exception messages, or message queue parameters, depending on the agent: C SDK: n/a Go high security mode settings Java high security mode settings .NET high security mode settings Node.js high security mode settings PHP high security mode settings Python high security mode settings Ruby high security mode settings Custom security settings If you want custom security settings, you can customize the configuration file, change custom attribute settings, or use the API, depending on your agent: C SDK custom security settings Go custom security settings Java custom security settings .NET custom security mode settings Node.js custom security settings PHP custom security settings Python custom security settings Ruby custom security settings Data received by New Relic This information applies to all APM agents no matter what security settings you have applied. Important Other data that New Relic receives is specific to the security settings for each agent. Data Captured? APM agent language version OS type and version System properties Average response time of transactions in your app URL hits Client IP address Not captured TLS and SSL Our preferred protocol for all domains is TLS 1.2. APM agents enable SSL by default. To verify which release includes SSL by default and to ensure that you have the most up-to-date version, refer to your agent's release notes: C SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby The configuration file also includes an optional flag (ssl) to enable or disable SSL using HTTPS. New Relic does not do host authentication with HTTPS, just communication encryption. Exception: You cannot disable SSL for the C SDK. The C SDK daemon can only connect with SSL. New Relic requires HTTPS for all traffic to APM and the REST API. This includes both inbound and outbound traffic. If your REST API call uses HTTP, or if you have disabled SSL in your configuration file, change your script or program to HTTPS. Data transmission Under Java, .NET and PHP, New Relic uses JSON to serialize data. The Ruby agent uses either Ruby marshaling or JSON serialization to send data to New Relic, depending on whether a native JSON encoder is available in under the Ruby version the agent is running on. For required changes when you want to create firewall rules to allow the agent to communicate, see Networks. For more information about security measures for your data in transit to New Relic or at rest in our storage, see Data encryption. Proxies Optional settings are available so that you can configure the agent to communicate through a proxy. To define proxy settings for host, port, domain, user, or password, refer to your agent's configuration file documentation: Agent Proxy settings C SDK -proxy at daemon startup Go transport Java Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_password proxy_port proxy_user .NET proxy element Node.js proxy PHP newrelic.daemon.proxy or the daemon's proxy setting Python proxy settings Ruby Use proxy settings, including: proxy_host proxy_port proxy_user proxy_pass",

Notify your team of deployments After a deployment is recorded using the REST API, you can optionally notify a webhook endpoint of the deployment. The destination of the webhook can be your Slack instance. To use webhooks to set up a deployment notification for a Slack channel: Log in to your Slack account as an admin, then go to App directory > Manage > Apps. Search for your New Relic app, then select Add configuration. From Post to channel, select an existing Slack channel or add a new channel, then Add configuration. From the list of options, copy the webhook URL. Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Integrations > Deploy notifications > Webhook. Paste the Slack webhook URL, then save. Optional: Send a test message. Tip You can also use webhooks, Slack channels, and other options for alert notifications with New Relic Alerts. End of life notification: Hipchat, Campfire As of September 9, 2019, integrations with Hipchat and Campfire for APM deployment notifications will no longer be available. Recommendation: If you are still using Hipchat or Campfire, use webhooks with Slack channels instead. For more information, see the New Relic Explorers Hub post.",
