      "body": "Problem If you have just configured your application with browser monitoring, wait a few minutes for data to appear. If you have already waited a few minutes and you still do not see any data, try these troubleshooting tips. Some of these tips depend on whether you deployed your app by allowing browser monitoring to automatically insert the JavaScript snippet into your APM-monitored app or by inserting the JavaScript snippet yourself. Tip To use APM and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Solution Recommendation: Before following specific troubleshooting procedures, run the Diagnostics browser checks. Once Diagnostics CLI is downloaded, target the browser checks by running the command-line options: /nrdiag -browser-url YOUR-WEBSITE-URL -suites browser. The information returned from Diagnostics CLI can be used when communicating with New Relic Support. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed for an account monitored with an APM agent, see APM deployments. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed using the JavaScript copy/paste method, see Copy/paste deployment. If you are unsure which you have, the Diagnostics tool will return the deployment method. You can also troubleshoot situations where you are missing only AJAX or session trace data. Deployment via APM agent These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when the browser monitoring agent is installed on an app already being monitored by an APM agent: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Update your APM agent More recent APM agents place the page load timing scripts more accurately. Before continuing with these troubleshooting tips, make sure you have the most recent release for your APM agent. Tip For agent version requirements for page load timing, see Compatibility and requirements. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the two script elements required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> (window.NREUM||(NREUM={})).loader_config={xpid:\"VRUGVVJS\";window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a(b,c,d){ ... Copy OR like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy Also verify that a second script element exists in one of two locations, depending on the app server agent language. C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java: Before the </body> tag (which must be added to the page if missing) .NET: Immediately before the first script element Node.js: Immediately before the first script element PHP: At the end of the body element Python: In the head element or at the end of the body element Ruby: Immediately before the first script element The second tag contains configuration and timing data, and looks like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy If either script element is missing, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. If the script elements are present and data does not appear after several minutes, get support at support.newrelic.com. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Configure auto-instrumentation If you are using New Relic's automatic instrumentation feature, ensure your agent is configured properly. Each agent has a configuration file setting and specific instructions to turn auto-instrumentation on or off: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java .NET Node.js agent: Currently not supported; see manual instrumentation procedures PHP Python Ruby Important If you modify your agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your app. Verify manual API instrumentation If you are manually calling the New Relic agent API to generate and insert the JavaScript, verify that the calls are actually being made. The APIs and how to use them are specific to your agent: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java agent .NET agent Node.js agent (see also the Node.js troubleshooting procedures) PHP agent Python agent Ruby agent Restart your APM app If you modified your APM agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your application so that it picks up the modified settings. Java agent: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache. This forces the app server to recompile. .NET agent: Make sure your asp.net cache directory is clean by using the command flush_dotnet_temp.cmd. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Checkpoint: Verify JavaScript on page Verify that the JavaScript is on the page as detailed in the previous step Verify the JavaScript snippets. If it is not on the page, use the manual instrumentation as detailed in Verify manual API instrumentation. The Javascript must be present on your page before you can proceed to the next step. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Deployment via JavaScript copy/paste These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when New Relic's browser monitoring agent was deployed using the HTML copy/paste method: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the script element required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy If the script element is missing, make sure that you have pasted it in and deployed your new code. If you have not yet pasted in the JavaScript snippet, you can copy it again from your browser app's Settings page. If applicable, restart the application serving these pages. If you still don't see the script, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. Clear any cached versions of your pages For the Javascript snippets to appear in pages served by your application, ensure that any cached versions of the pages from before you added the code have been cleared. Check any CDN caches. Flush your webserver cache. Check the JavaScript placement and completeness Insert the JavaScript as close to the top of the HEAD as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (X-UA-Compatible and charset). It must be outside any comments. Here is an example of the general format: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta tags> {PLACE NEW RELIC SCRIPT TAG HERE} <script and link tags> </head> <body> ... </body> </html> Copy If the Javascript is correctly placed, compare it with the original snippet you generated to ensure it is complete and identical. Incomplete or modified snippets may not report correctly. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Razor framework: Check for a parser error message If you use the copy/paste installation method in a .NET app that uses the Razor Framework, this may result in the following error: Parser Error Message: \"\").pop().split(\"\" is not valid at the start of a code block. Only identifiers, keywords, comments, \"(\" and \"{\" are valid. Copy The error is caused by an @ symbol in theJavaScript snippet for browser monitoring . The @ symbol represents the beginning of a code block in Razor. The line that causes the problem is: .split(\"@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy To fix this issue, use one of these workarounds: Wrap the browser JavaScript snippet in <text></text> tags to force it to be interpreted as content. OR Add another @ to the line to escape it. Check that the line looks like this: .split(\"@@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy Use only one of the workarounds. Using both will break the code again.",

      "body": "Problem If you have just configured your application with browser monitoring, wait a few minutes for data to appear. If you have already waited a few minutes and you still do not see any data, try these troubleshooting tips. Some of these tips depend on whether you deployed your app by allowing browser monitoring to automatically insert the JavaScript snippet into your APM-monitored app or by inserting the JavaScript snippet yourself. Tip To use APM and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Solution Recommendation: Before following specific troubleshooting procedures, run the Diagnostics browser checks. Once Diagnostics CLI is downloaded, target the browser checks by running the command-line options: /nrdiag -browser-url YOUR-WEBSITE-URL -suites browser. The information returned from Diagnostics CLI can be used when communicating with New Relic Support. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed for an account monitored with an APM agent, see APM deployments. If your browser monitoring agent was deployed using the JavaScript copy/paste method, see Copy/paste deployment. If you are unsure which you have, the Diagnostics tool will return the deployment method. You can also troubleshoot situations where you are missing only AJAX or session trace data. Deployment via APM agent These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when the browser monitoring agent is installed on an app already being monitored by an APM agent: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Update your APM agent More recent APM agents place the page load timing scripts more accurately. Before continuing with these troubleshooting tips, make sure you have the most recent release for your APM agent. Tip For agent version requirements for page load timing, see Compatibility and requirements. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the two script elements required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> (window.NREUM||(NREUM={})).loader_config={xpid:\"VRUGVVJS\";window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a(b,c,d){ ... Copy OR like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy Also verify that a second script element exists in one of two locations, depending on the app server agent language. C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java: Before the </body> tag (which must be added to the page if missing) .NET: Immediately before the first script element Node.js: Immediately before the first script element PHP: At the end of the body element Python: In the head element or at the end of the body element Ruby: Immediately before the first script element The second tag contains configuration and timing data, and looks like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={});NREUM.info={\"beacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\",\"errorBeacon\":\"bam.nr-data.net\"... Copy If either script element is missing, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. If the script elements are present and data does not appear after several minutes, get support at support.newrelic.com. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Configure auto-instrumentation If you are using New Relic's automatic instrumentation feature, ensure your agent is configured properly. Each agent has a configuration file setting and specific instructions to turn auto-instrumentation on or off: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java .NET Node.js agent: Currently not supported; see manual instrumentation procedures PHP Python Ruby Important If you modify your agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your app. Verify manual API instrumentation If you are manually calling the New Relic agent API to generate and insert the JavaScript, verify that the calls are actually being made. The APIs and how to use them are specific to your agent: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java agent .NET agent Node.js agent (see also the Node.js troubleshooting procedures) PHP agent Python agent Ruby agent Restart your APM app If you modified your APM agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your application so that it picks up the modified settings. Java agent: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache. This forces the app server to recompile. .NET agent: Make sure your asp.net cache directory is clean by using the command flush_dotnet_temp.cmd. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Checkpoint: Verify JavaScript on page Verify that the JavaScript is on the page as detailed in the previous step Verify the JavaScript snippets. If it is not on the page, use the manual instrumentation as detailed in Verify manual API instrumentation. The Javascript must be present on your page before you can proceed to the next step. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Deployment via JavaScript copy/paste These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when New Relic's browser monitoring agent was deployed using the HTML copy/paste method: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the script element required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy If the script element is missing, make sure that you have pasted it in and deployed your new code. If you have not yet pasted in the JavaScript snippet, you can copy it again from your browser app's Settings page. If applicable, restart the application serving these pages. If you still don't see the script, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. Clear any cached versions of your pages For the Javascript snippets to appear in pages served by your application, ensure that any cached versions of the pages from before you added the code have been cleared. Check any CDN caches. Flush your webserver cache. Check the JavaScript placement and completeness Insert the JavaScript as close to the top of the HEAD as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (X-UA-Compatible and charset). It must be outside any comments. Here is an example of the general format: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta tags> {PLACE NEW RELIC SCRIPT TAG HERE} <script and link tags> </head> <body> ... </body> </html> Copy If the Javascript is correctly placed, compare it with the original snippet you generated to ensure it is complete and identical. Incomplete or modified snippets may not report correctly. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Razor framework: Check for a parser error message If you use the copy/paste installation method in a .NET app that uses the Razor Framework, this may result in the following error: Parser Error Message: \"\").pop().split(\"\" is not valid at the start of a code block. Only identifiers, keywords, comments, \"(\" and \"{\" are valid. Copy The error is caused by an @ symbol in theJavaScript snippet for browser monitoring . The @ symbol represents the beginning of a code block in Razor. The line that causes the problem is: .split(\"@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy To fix this issue, use one of these workarounds: Wrap the browser JavaScript snippet in <text></text> tags to force it to be interpreted as content. OR Add another @ to the line to escape it. Check that the line looks like this: .split(\"@@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy Use only one of the workarounds. Using both will break the code again.",

If the script elements are present and data does not appear after several minutes, get support at support.newrelic.com. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Configure auto-instrumentation If you are using New Relic's automatic instrumentation feature, ensure your agent is configured properly. Each agent has a configuration file setting and specific instructions to turn auto-instrumentation on or off: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java .NET Node.js agent: Currently not supported; see manual instrumentation procedures PHP Python Ruby Important If you modify your agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your app. Verify manual API instrumentation If you are manually calling the New Relic agent API to generate and insert the JavaScript, verify that the calls are actually being made. The APIs and how to use them are specific to your agent: C SDK: n/a Go: n/a Java agent .NET agent Node.js agent (see also the Node.js troubleshooting procedures) PHP agent Python agent Ruby agent Restart your APM app If you modified your APM agent's configuration file, be sure to restart your application so that it picks up the modified settings. Java agent: Flush the app server’s \"work\" cache. This forces the app server to recompile. .NET agent: Make sure your asp.net cache directory is clean by using the command flush_dotnet_temp.cmd. This forces the app server to recompile ASPs with page load timing instrumentation. Checkpoint: Verify JavaScript on page Verify that the JavaScript is on the page as detailed in the previous step Verify the JavaScript snippets. If it is not on the page, use the manual instrumentation as detailed in Verify manual API instrumentation. The Javascript must be present on your page before you can proceed to the next step. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Deployment via JavaScript copy/paste These troubleshooting steps apply to problems when New Relic's browser monitoring agent was deployed using the HTML copy/paste method: Enable your app Verify that browser monitoring has been enabled in your application's Browser settings: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings. Follow standard procedures to enable browser settings for each app. Flush your webserver cache. Wait a few more minutes for data to arrive. Try the next steps if you still do not see any data. Verify the JavaScript snippets Check your page's source for the script element required to capture metrics and send them to New Relic. In a browser, view the source of your page, and look for a script element near the beginning like this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> window.NREUM||(NREUM={}),__nr_require=function a (b,c,d){ ... Copy If the script element is missing, make sure that you have pasted it in and deployed your new code. If you have not yet pasted in the JavaScript snippet, you can copy it again from your browser app's Settings page. If applicable, restart the application serving these pages. If you still don't see the script, continue troubleshooting with the following steps. Clear any cached versions of your pages For the Javascript snippets to appear in pages served by your application, ensure that any cached versions of the pages from before you added the code have been cleared. Check any CDN caches. Flush your webserver cache. Check the JavaScript placement and completeness Insert the JavaScript as close to the top of the HEAD as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (X-UA-Compatible and charset). It must be outside any comments. Here is an example of the general format: <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta tags> {PLACE NEW RELIC SCRIPT TAG HERE} <script and link tags> </head> <body> ... </body> </html> Copy If the Javascript is correctly placed, compare it with the original snippet you generated to ensure it is complete and identical. Incomplete or modified snippets may not report correctly. Check other JavaScript error monitors If you see JavaScript errors on your webpage, or if you do not see any data on your JavaScript errors page in the New Relic UI, check if any other JavaScript error monitoring frameworks have been enabled for your app. Some JavaScript error monitors may interfere with functionality for browser monitoring. Verify end-user network access If your application is loaded primarily within a secured local network, ensure that your users can reach the necessary network endpoints to report browser data. This includes New Relic's CDNs and beacon. Razor framework: Check for a parser error message If you use the copy/paste installation method in a .NET app that uses the Razor Framework, this may result in the following error: Parser Error Message: \"\").pop().split(\"\" is not valid at the start of a code block. Only identifiers, keywords, comments, \"(\" and \"{\" are valid. Copy The error is caused by an @ symbol in theJavaScript snippet for browser monitoring . The @ symbol represents the beginning of a code block in Razor. The line that causes the problem is: .split(\"@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy To fix this issue, use one of these workarounds: Wrap the browser JavaScript snippet in <text></text> tags to force it to be interpreted as content. OR Add another @ to the line to escape it. Check that the line looks like this: .split(\"@@\").pop().split(\":\") Copy Use only one of the workarounds. Using both will break the code again.",

The app dynamically updates without requiring a full page reload, in response to user interactions with the app, such as clicking a button or submitting a request. Browser's SPA monitoring provides deeper visibility and actionable insights into real users' experiences with single-page apps. SPA monitoring is also valuable for any app that uses AJAX requests to pull content dynamically and create a fluid user experience. In addition to monitoring route changes automatically, you can use browser monitoring's SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. This allows developers and their team to: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query your data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Enable SPA monitoring Before installing SPA monitoring, read SPA compatibility and requirements. Then, see Add apps to Single Page App monitoring.

For more about how New Relic handles SPA data, see Understand SPA data collection. Browser SPA features Here is a summary of SPA monitoring features: Single-page app monitoring Take advantage of these features Robust views in browser's UI When a user initiates a page load or route change, New Relic begins to monitor all subsequent JavaScript, and ends the timing once all AJAX events are complete. This provides a more accurate view of when a page is actually ready for a user compared to the traditional method of ending the timing when the window load event is fired. When SPA monitoring is enabled, the Page views page in browser shows event-driven data about application usage levels (throughput) and user experience (performance), including: Charts with drill-down details about initial page load performance, route changes, and historical performance Sort, search, and filter options, including custom attributes Additional AJAX breakdown data for all initial page loads and route changes For an explanation of how SPA monitoring will impact your existing browser account's data usage, see SPA and browser data usage. Data analysis with data explorer The data explorer supports three SPA-specific event types: BrowserInteraction, AjaxRequest, and BrowserTiming.

      "body": "Problem You are using the Pro + SPA agent, but you are not seeing all of the route change browser interactions you expect. We are aware that this can be frustrating. Our goal in summer 2020 is to reevaluate the SPA feature functionality, making it simpler and more reliable, starting with the methods we use to detect and capture route changes. Additionally, we plan to add new frameworks and use cases to our testing suite based on your feedback and examples. Likely this work will include new APIs as well as framework-specific plug-ins. Check our release notes for the latest updates. Solution Short term solutions To make sure all route changes are captured, you can use our SPA interaction() API. Using the interaction API will categorize the BrowserInteraction event (in the category attribute) as custom rather than a route change if no route change is in fact detected. If your framework is exposing events that represent router activity, you can use custom instrumentation in these events. Here is an example using our API with the Angular router: router.events.subscribe( (event: Event) => { if (event instanceof NavigationStart) { let i = newrelic.interaction() i.setName(event.url) i.save() } }); Copy In this example, the router object is an instance of the Angular router (from the @angular/router module). The setName call sets the name attribute of the BrowserInteraction event to the new URL, and the save call ensures that the interaction is captured. You will need to adapt this for the needs of your own application’s framework. If your framework does not provide routing events, then you can add this code in the event handler of the original interaction event such as click): myButton.addEventListener('click', function () { let i = newrelic.interaction() i.setName(‘new URL') i.save() }); Copy Recommendation: If you do not have access to router events nor the interaction event handler, implement this as soon as possible in code that you know is the result of a user interaction. An alternative to using the SPA API is to capture routes as PageAction events. PageAction events can be used to capture any custom data. We recommend this option as a fallback in case using the SPA interaction API does not work as expected, or to completely separate the custom instrumentation from built-in BrowserInteraction events. Both of these solutions can ensure these events are captured, either as a BrowserInteraction event or as a PageAction event. However, they will not address recording the correct duration and related AJAX calls. Support If this solution does not resolve your issue, please file a support ticket, and have the following information available: For situations where you are seeing most route changes, but none for a particular route change you expect, attempt to evaluate the difference in the implementation of the code for that particular route. Is there something non-standard or unique about that route that you could provide to our support team? Document the frameworks and any libraries that might be of interest. If this is a new problem, has anything changed in your environment that has led to these interactions suddenly not being tracked? Note the browser agent version you are using. If you are more than a few releases behind, we will recommend that you update to the latest release, as we may have already resolved a similar issue. Be aware that due to the complexity of diagnosing these issues, the team will likely need access to an environment and code that demonstrates the problem for testing and research. Cause The browser agent attempts to be framework agnostic, as well as support coding best practices. However, there are often edge cases that will be missed that lead to you not collecting the route changes you expect. The implementation is based on instrumenting most common asynchronous browser APIs. There are cases when a web application uses some asynchronous API or uses custom or third-party code that we do not instrument, and this can result in inaccurate or missed route changes.",

To activate this snippet version for your application, enable your application for SPA monitoring. To check your version and integrate the updated snippet, follow the appropriate upgrade instructions. Browser types SPA monitoring requires the addEventListener browser API and the Navigation Timing API. Both APIs are available in all modern browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) versions 9 or higher. Framework requirements Because SPA instrumentation works by wrapping low-level browser APIs, it is framework-agnostic. SPA instrumentation is compatible with most SPA frameworks, such as Angular, Backbone, Ember, and React. It can also instrument requests made using JSONP. Below are known compatibility issues: If your application uses AngularJS and you want to use browser's SPA monitoring capabilities, Zone.js versions 0.6.18-0.6.24 are not compatible with the SPA agent. The html2pdf.js library is not compatible with the SPA agent. Security when collecting hash fragments New Relic collects and saves hash fragments from route change URLs.

      "body": "Single page applications (SPAs) are web applications that load a single HTML page. The app dynamically updates without requiring a full page reload, in response to user interactions with the app, such as clicking a button or submitting a request. Browser's SPA monitoring provides deeper visibility and actionable insights into real users' experiences with single-page apps. SPA monitoring is also valuable for any app that uses AJAX requests to pull content dynamically and create a fluid user experience. In addition to monitoring route changes automatically, you can use browser monitoring's SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. This allows developers and their team to: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query your data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Enable SPA monitoring Before installing SPA monitoring, read SPA compatibility and requirements. Then, see Add apps to Single Page App monitoring. Analyze throughput and performance data Improving on traditional industry standards for measuring page load timing, we give you a complete picture of the activity, both synchronous and asynchronous, associated with page loads and route changes. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views: Use browser monitoring's SPA monitoring to examine the throughput and performance of your SPA-architecture app. SPA data monitored by browser monitoring includes: Performance data and throughput for page loads and route changes AJAX request data JavaScript activity, both synchronous and asynchronous Dynamic page updates, monitored using the SPA API With this data, you will gain a clear understanding of how your users experience your app's page loads and route changes, and be able to solve bottlenecks and troubleshoot errors. For more about how New Relic handles SPA data, see Understand SPA data collection. Browser SPA features Here is a summary of SPA monitoring features: Single-page app monitoring Take advantage of these features Robust views in browser's UI When a user initiates a page load or route change, New Relic begins to monitor all subsequent JavaScript, and ends the timing once all AJAX events are complete. This provides a more accurate view of when a page is actually ready for a user compared to the traditional method of ending the timing when the window load event is fired. When SPA monitoring is enabled, the Page views page in browser shows event-driven data about application usage levels (throughput) and user experience (performance), including: Charts with drill-down details about initial page load performance, route changes, and historical performance Sort, search, and filter options, including custom attributes Additional AJAX breakdown data for all initial page loads and route changes For an explanation of how SPA monitoring will impact your existing browser account's data usage, see SPA and browser data usage. Data analysis with data explorer The data explorer supports three SPA-specific event types: BrowserInteraction, AjaxRequest, and BrowserTiming. You can query these events in the query builder to analyze your app's performance and make business decisions. Customized data from API Use SPA API to obtain the specific data you need, such as custom naming, custom timing, finishline API, or other custom attributes.",

Tip To use SPA and browser monitoring, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Prerequisites In order to deploy SPA monitoring, you must: Make sure your app and browser agent version meet New Relic's compatibility and requirements. Agree to the Terms of Service, which automatically appears during the setup process for the first app you select for your account. By agreeing to the Terms, you authorize New Relic to collect hash fragments from URLs. You only need to select the checkbox option once for your account. Enable SPA monitoring To deploy SPA monitoring for your app, you must already have a Pro subscription. Then, you must enable Pro + SPA monitoring, and deploy a new JavaScript snippet that includes SPA monitoring. Tip The bottom of the generated JavaScript snippet includes your browser license key and application ID. This is useful, for example, when using the New Relic REST API (v2) or API Explorer. To enable SPA monitoring: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings, then select Pro + SPA. Agree to the Terms of Service. Select Save application settings. Deploy the new JavaScript snippet using the same method you used when you originally deployed the browser agent for your app: If you deploy browser with the copy/paste method: Copy the entire JavaScript code snippet. Paste it as close to the top of the HEAD of your webpage as possible, but after any position-sensitive META tags (for example, X-UA-Compatible or charset information). If you deploy using an APM agent: If possible, restart your app and clear the server-side cache to ensure the APM agent picks up the change and deploys the new JavaScript snippet. Generate some traffic, then wait a few minutes for browser to start receiving SPA monitoring data. To view SPA data: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. If SPA data does not start to appear in the Page views page after a few minutes, see browser's troubleshooting procedures. Disable SPA monitoring To opt out of our SPA monitoring feature: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Select a different agent version/loader option.

The app dynamically updates without requiring a full page reload, in response to user interactions with the app, such as clicking a button or submitting a request. Browser's SPA monitoring provides deeper visibility and actionable insights into real users' experiences with single-page apps. SPA monitoring is also valuable for any app that uses AJAX requests to pull content dynamically and create a fluid user experience. In addition to monitoring route changes automatically, you can use browser monitoring's SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. This allows developers and their team to: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query your data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Enable SPA monitoring Before installing SPA monitoring, read SPA compatibility and requirements. Then, see Add apps to Single Page App monitoring. Analyze throughput and performance data Improving on traditional industry standards for measuring page load timing, we give you a complete picture of the activity, both synchronous and asynchronous, associated with page loads and route changes. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views: Use browser monitoring's SPA monitoring to examine the throughput and performance of your SPA-architecture app. SPA data monitored by browser monitoring includes: Performance data and throughput for page loads and route changes AJAX request data JavaScript activity, both synchronous and asynchronous Dynamic page updates, monitored using the SPA API With this data, you will gain a clear understanding of how your users experience your app's page loads and route changes, and be able to solve bottlenecks and troubleshoot errors. For more about how New Relic handles SPA data, see Understand SPA data collection. Browser SPA features Here is a summary of SPA monitoring features: Single-page app monitoring Take advantage of these features Robust views in browser's UI When a user initiates a page load or route change, New Relic begins to monitor all subsequent JavaScript, and ends the timing once all AJAX events are complete. This provides a more accurate view of when a page is actually ready for a user compared to the traditional method of ending the timing when the window load event is fired. When SPA monitoring is enabled, the Page views page in browser shows event-driven data about application usage levels (throughput) and user experience (performance), including: Charts with drill-down details about initial page load performance, route changes, and historical performance Sort, search, and filter options, including custom attributes Additional AJAX breakdown data for all initial page loads and route changes For an explanation of how SPA monitoring will impact your existing browser account's data usage, see SPA and browser data usage. Data analysis with data explorer The data explorer supports three SPA-specific event types: BrowserInteraction, AjaxRequest, and BrowserTiming. You can query these events in the query builder to analyze your app's performance and make business decisions.

Single-page app (SPA) data To view SPA data: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. Initial page loads and route changes are automatically grouped by browser interaction name. You can adjust this with your allow list settings for segments. If you set custom route names with the SPA API, the custom route names will be displayed. You can change how the page loads and route changes are grouped by using the Group page by dropdown. By default, the list of page loads and route changes displays the most time consuming views at the top of the list. You can also sort by average response time, median response time, and throughput per minute by using the Sort by dropdown. To search for specific views by grouped URL, type in the search bar below the Sort by dropdown. For example, to find URLs that represent your checkout page, search for checkout. The charts on the initial Page view page display: The five views with the slowest average response times The five views with the highest throughput To change the range of time being examined, use the time picker near the top of the page. (If you choose a time range more than eight days in the past, some filtering and grouping functionality won't be available.) Filter SPA views one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views > Filter: Use the Filter to filter for route changes, initial page loads, and other attributes like location and browser type. To view only initial page loads or only route changes, use the Filter dropdown. For example, to view only route changes, select Filter > Route change. The filter also gives you the ability to filter by other attributes of page loads and route changes, such as app name, geographical location of the browser, and browser type. For example, to see only page loads and route changes that occurred on browsers in the city of Portland, Oregon, select Filter > City > Portland. Group SPA views You can use the Group page by dropdown to group the list of page views by any attribute. For example, if you want to compare the average response times by browser type, select Group page by > userAgent. The combination of filtering and grouping lets you quickly find very specific data. For example, to compare how a specific URL is loading on different browsers: From the Filter dropdown, select targetURL, then select the URL you want to study. From the Group page by dropdown, select userAgent. SPA view details one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views > (select a view): Select a view from the list to see assorted details and breakdowns. Select an individual page load or route change to see details. Selecting either will provide a breakdown of where time was spent for a browser interaction, and display that data over a time series matching the window selected in the time picker. Every route change view can theoretically also be an initial page load. (For example, when a route change URL is sent to someone else and they load it, that will now be considered an initial page load to New Relic.) This is why the SPA view details page has charts for both initial page loads and route changes. This allows you to compare how a view performs as an initial page load to how its performance as a route change. There are three chart display options, selectable with the icons to the right of the Avg initial page load time chart title. The default display is the color-coded stacked area chart. You can also switch to a Histogram display or a percentile line graph. Also on the details page is a Throughput chart that combines initial page loads and route changes. The chart displays the 5 pages with the highest throughput, which are listed beneath the chart, and consolidates all other pages into Other. Here are details on the specific performance data displayed for both page loads and route changes: Initial page load performance details For initial page loads, the performance details include the average back end time, front end time, and the window onload event: Back end time includes network, web app time, and request queuing. Front end time includes DOM processing, page rendering, and the time to complete all XHRs. A horizontal red line shows when the window load event is fired. This corresponds to the traditional page load timing measured by the browser agent without SPA monitoring enabled. With SPA monitoring it is common to have a window load event before the front end time is complete. (For more about how SPA page load timing differs from traditional page load timing, see Understand SPA data collection.) Route change performance details For route changes, the performance chart displays JS duration and waiting time. JS Duration is the sum of all JavaScript execution time during the interaction, which is synchronous by definition. The remaining time is called Waiting time and is derived by subtracting JS duration from the total duration. The Historical performance and Breakdown details are similar for both page loads and route changes: Detail tab Comments Historical data The Historical performance tab displays throughput (views per minute) and response time charted against the same time period yesterday and last week. Breakdowns The Breakdowns tab lists the various components individually timed as part of an interaction. By default, all XHRs are captured and timed. You can also use the SPA API to include additional elements for a route change or page load.",

      "body": "Problem You are using the Pro + SPA agent, but you are not seeing all of the route change browser interactions you expect. We are aware that this can be frustrating. Our goal in summer 2020 is to reevaluate the SPA feature functionality, making it simpler and more reliable, starting with the methods we use to detect and capture route changes. Additionally, we plan to add new frameworks and use cases to our testing suite based on your feedback and examples. Likely this work will include new APIs as well as framework-specific plug-ins. Check our release notes for the latest updates. Solution Short term solutions To make sure all route changes are captured, you can use our SPA interaction() API. Using the interaction API will categorize the BrowserInteraction event (in the category attribute) as custom rather than a route change if no route change is in fact detected. If your framework is exposing events that represent router activity, you can use custom instrumentation in these events. Here is an example using our API with the Angular router: router.events.subscribe( (event: Event) => { if (event instanceof NavigationStart) { let i = newrelic.interaction() i.setName(event.url) i.save() } }); Copy In this example, the router object is an instance of the Angular router (from the @angular/router module). The setName call sets the name attribute of the BrowserInteraction event to the new URL, and the save call ensures that the interaction is captured. You will need to adapt this for the needs of your own application’s framework. If your framework does not provide routing events, then you can add this code in the event handler of the original interaction event such as click): myButton.addEventListener('click', function () { let i = newrelic.interaction() i.setName(‘new URL') i.save() }); Copy Recommendation: If you do not have access to router events nor the interaction event handler, implement this as soon as possible in code that you know is the result of a user interaction. An alternative to using the SPA API is to capture routes as PageAction events. PageAction events can be used to capture any custom data. We recommend this option as a fallback in case using the SPA interaction API does not work as expected, or to completely separate the custom instrumentation from built-in BrowserInteraction events. Both of these solutions can ensure these events are captured, either as a BrowserInteraction event or as a PageAction event. However, they will not address recording the correct duration and related AJAX calls. Support If this solution does not resolve your issue, please file a support ticket, and have the following information available: For situations where you are seeing most route changes, but none for a particular route change you expect, attempt to evaluate the difference in the implementation of the code for that particular route. Is there something non-standard or unique about that route that you could provide to our support team? Document the frameworks and any libraries that might be of interest. If this is a new problem, has anything changed in your environment that has led to these interactions suddenly not being tracked? Note the browser agent version you are using. If you are more than a few releases behind, we will recommend that you update to the latest release, as we may have already resolved a similar issue. Be aware that due to the complexity of diagnosing these issues, the team will likely need access to an environment and code that demonstrates the problem for testing and research. Cause The browser agent attempts to be framework agnostic, as well as support coding best practices. However, there are often edge cases that will be missed that lead to you not collecting the route changes you expect. The implementation is based on instrumenting most common asynchronous browser APIs. There are cases when a web application uses some asynchronous API or uses custom or third-party code that we do not instrument, and this can result in inaccurate or missed route changes.",

Browser's SPA monitoring provides deeper visibility and actionable insights into real users' experiences with single-page apps. SPA monitoring is also valuable for any app that uses AJAX requests to pull content dynamically and create a fluid user experience. In addition to monitoring route changes automatically, you can use browser monitoring's SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. This allows developers and their team to: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query your data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Enable SPA monitoring Before installing SPA monitoring, read SPA compatibility and requirements. Then, see Add apps to Single Page App monitoring. Analyze throughput and performance data Improving on traditional industry standards for measuring page load timing, we give you a complete picture of the activity, both synchronous and asynchronous, associated with page loads and route changes. one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views: Use browser monitoring's SPA monitoring to examine the throughput and performance of your SPA-architecture app. SPA data monitored by browser monitoring includes: Performance data and throughput for page loads and route changes AJAX request data JavaScript activity, both synchronous and asynchronous Dynamic page updates, monitored using the SPA API With this data, you will gain a clear understanding of how your users experience your app's page loads and route changes, and be able to solve bottlenecks and troubleshoot errors. For more about how New Relic handles SPA data, see Understand SPA data collection. Browser SPA features Here is a summary of SPA monitoring features: Single-page app monitoring Take advantage of these features Robust views in browser's UI When a user initiates a page load or route change, New Relic begins to monitor all subsequent JavaScript, and ends the timing once all AJAX events are complete. This provides a more accurate view of when a page is actually ready for a user compared to the traditional method of ending the timing when the window load event is fired. When SPA monitoring is enabled, the Page views page in browser shows event-driven data about application usage levels (throughput) and user experience (performance), including: Charts with drill-down details about initial page load performance, route changes, and historical performance Sort, search, and filter options, including custom attributes Additional AJAX breakdown data for all initial page loads and route changes For an explanation of how SPA monitoring will impact your existing browser account's data usage, see SPA and browser data usage. Data analysis with data explorer The data explorer supports three SPA-specific event types: BrowserInteraction, AjaxRequest, and BrowserTiming. You can query these events in the query builder to analyze your app's performance and make business decisions. Customized data from API Use SPA API to obtain the specific data you need, such as custom naming, custom timing, finishline API, or other custom attributes.",

This will give you a better understanding of the SPA data you see in the browser UI. This will also help you more easily add custom monitoring with the SPA API. Browser interactions At the heart of SPA monitoring is the concept of the browser interaction. New Relic defines a browser interaction as anything that occurs in the app user's browser; for example: A user interaction that leads to a page load or route change A scheduled, dynamic update to an app's widget A browser interaction includes not just the initial triggering event, but also the activity caused by that event, such as AJAX requests and both synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript. By tracking not just the cause but also the effects of a browser interaction, we help you understand how users experience your application's views and route changes. All apps are different and have different monitoring needs. That's why we include default monitoring as well as the ability to set up custom monitoring for any browser interactions you choose. Types of SPA data reporting Three major categories of single page app data can be reported to New Relic: Initial page loads Route changes Custom browser interactions created via the SPA API Each of these creates a BrowserInteraction event. If one or more AJAX requests are part of an interaction, then associated AjaxRequest events are also created. These events and their attributes can be queried in the query builder. Initial page loads An initial page load is a traditional URL change, stemming from a complete load or reload of a URL. This is indicated in the browser when a page load event fires (the window.onload event). Initial page loads appear along with route changes in the browser UI. Route changes SPA users experience dynamic route changes in a similar way to page loads. Visitors to a site or app generally do not care how a new view was delivered; they simply know that when they perform an action, a new view appears. For this reason, we treat route changes in a similar way to page loads in the UI. In order to optimally monitor single page applications, we start monitoring many browser interactions that could theoretically lead to route changes. If these interactions do not lead to route changes, browser initiates monitoring but then discards them. If these interactions do lead to a route change, browser saves the interaction sequence as a BrowserInteraction event, including information about both synchronous and asynchronous activity. An interaction is considered a route change and saved as a BrowserInteraction event when one of the following occurs: The URL hash changes (usually using window.location.hash). A popstate event fires during a callback associated with an interaction. A pushState or replaceState API is called. Route changes appear along with initial page loads in the browser UI. We receive and save hash fragments from route change URLs. If you use hashes to pass private or sensitive data, that data may be visible to your New Relic account users. For more information about data collection and reporting, see Security for browser. Custom monitoring You can use the SPA API to set up custom monitoring of browser interactions that are not monitored by default. You can also use the API to disable default monitoring. Custom events are saved as BrowserInteraction events and have the following attributes: The category attribute will have the value Custom. The trigger attribute will have the value api. (This is the default value but can be changed with the API.) Difference from traditional page load timing To provide optimized data for single page app monitoring, we measure page load timing in a new way: by wrapping low level browser functions, both synchronous and asynchronous. This gives a fuller depiction of how long it takes to complete the changes required for a new view. This is different from the traditional method for page load timing. Traditional page load timing uses the firing of the window.onload event to determine when a page is loaded. This is not an optimal way to measure view change timing because web apps often have asynchronous code that runs for a significant amount of time after the window.onload event occurs. Tip Browser's standard, non-SPA Page views page displays different page load times than when SPA monitoring is enabled. Because SPA monitoring is measuring all asynchronous activity, the SPA load times will generally be longer than standard page load times. The traditional window.onload page load timing still appears on the SPA Page views page. When you select a specific page load event, Window onload appears as a red line in the page load time chart. You can also select Switch to standard page views to return to traditional load timing displays. Timers The agent monitors all asynchronous calls, including timers. Timers with durations shorter than one second are wrapped. Timers longer than one second are not wrapped because usually they are meant for non-web transactions, such as background work or polling that is unrelated to a user interaction. Events and attributes We save browser interactions that lead to route changes and page loads as BrowserInteraction events, and AJAX requests as AjaxRequest events. You can query these events in the query builder.",

Single-page app (SPA) data To view SPA data: Go to one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views. Initial page loads and route changes are automatically grouped by browser interaction name. You can adjust this with your allow list settings for segments. If you set custom route names with the SPA API, the custom route names will be displayed. You can change how the page loads and route changes are grouped by using the Group page by dropdown. By default, the list of page loads and route changes displays the most time consuming views at the top of the list. You can also sort by average response time, median response time, and throughput per minute by using the Sort by dropdown. To search for specific views by grouped URL, type in the search bar below the Sort by dropdown. For example, to find URLs that represent your checkout page, search for checkout. The charts on the initial Page view page display: The five views with the slowest average response times The five views with the highest throughput To change the range of time being examined, use the time picker near the top of the page. (If you choose a time range more than eight days in the past, some filtering and grouping functionality won't be available.) Filter SPA views one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views > Filter: Use the Filter to filter for route changes, initial page loads, and other attributes like location and browser type. To view only initial page loads or only route changes, use the Filter dropdown. For example, to view only route changes, select Filter > Route change. The filter also gives you the ability to filter by other attributes of page loads and route changes, such as app name, geographical location of the browser, and browser type. For example, to see only page loads and route changes that occurred on browsers in the city of Portland, Oregon, select Filter > City > Portland. Group SPA views You can use the Group page by dropdown to group the list of page views by any attribute. For example, if you want to compare the average response times by browser type, select Group page by > userAgent. The combination of filtering and grouping lets you quickly find very specific data. For example, to compare how a specific URL is loading on different browsers: From the Filter dropdown, select targetURL, then select the URL you want to study. From the Group page by dropdown, select userAgent. SPA view details one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > Page views > (select a view): Select a view from the list to see assorted details and breakdowns. Select an individual page load or route change to see details. Selecting either will provide a breakdown of where time was spent for a browser interaction, and display that data over a time series matching the window selected in the time picker. Every route change view can theoretically also be an initial page load. (For example, when a route change URL is sent to someone else and they load it, that will now be considered an initial page load to New Relic.) This is why the SPA view details page has charts for both initial page loads and route changes. This allows you to compare how a view performs as an initial page load to how its performance as a route change. There are three chart display options, selectable with the icons to the right of the Avg initial page load time chart title. The default display is the color-coded stacked area chart. You can also switch to a Histogram display or a percentile line graph. Also on the details page is a Throughput chart that combines initial page loads and route changes. The chart displays the 5 pages with the highest throughput, which are listed beneath the chart, and consolidates all other pages into Other. Here are details on the specific performance data displayed for both page loads and route changes: Initial page load performance details For initial page loads, the performance details include the average back end time, front end time, and the window onload event: Back end time includes network, web app time, and request queuing. Front end time includes DOM processing, page rendering, and the time to complete all XHRs. A horizontal red line shows when the window load event is fired. This corresponds to the traditional page load timing measured by the browser agent without SPA monitoring enabled. With SPA monitoring it is common to have a window load event before the front end time is complete. (For more about how SPA page load timing differs from traditional page load timing, see Understand SPA data collection.) Route change performance details For route changes, the performance chart displays JS duration and waiting time. JS Duration is the sum of all JavaScript execution time during the interaction, which is synchronous by definition. The remaining time is called Waiting time and is derived by subtracting JS duration from the total duration. The Historical performance and Breakdown details are similar for both page loads and route changes: Detail tab Comments Historical data The Historical performance tab displays throughput (views per minute) and response time charted against the same time period yesterday and last week. Breakdowns The Breakdowns tab lists the various components individually timed as part of an interaction. By default, all XHRs are captured and timed. You can also use the SPA API to include additional elements for a route change or page load.",

      "body": "Problem You are using the Pro + SPA agent, but you are not seeing all of the route change browser interactions you expect. We are aware that this can be frustrating. Our goal in summer 2020 is to reevaluate the SPA feature functionality, making it simpler and more reliable, starting with the methods we use to detect and capture route changes. Additionally, we plan to add new frameworks and use cases to our testing suite based on your feedback and examples. Likely this work will include new APIs as well as framework-specific plug-ins. Check our release notes for the latest updates. Solution Short term solutions To make sure all route changes are captured, you can use our SPA interaction() API. Using the interaction API will categorize the BrowserInteraction event (in the category attribute) as custom rather than a route change if no route change is in fact detected. If your framework is exposing events that represent router activity, you can use custom instrumentation in these events. Here is an example using our API with the Angular router: router.events.subscribe( (event: Event) => { if (event instanceof NavigationStart) { let i = newrelic.interaction() i.setName(event.url) i.save() } }); Copy In this example, the router object is an instance of the Angular router (from the @angular/router module). The setName call sets the name attribute of the BrowserInteraction event to the new URL, and the save call ensures that the interaction is captured. You will need to adapt this for the needs of your own application’s framework. If your framework does not provide routing events, then you can add this code in the event handler of the original interaction event such as click): myButton.addEventListener('click', function () { let i = newrelic.interaction() i.setName(‘new URL') i.save() }); Copy Recommendation: If you do not have access to router events nor the interaction event handler, implement this as soon as possible in code that you know is the result of a user interaction. An alternative to using the SPA API is to capture routes as PageAction events. PageAction events can be used to capture any custom data. We recommend this option as a fallback in case using the SPA interaction API does not work as expected, or to completely separate the custom instrumentation from built-in BrowserInteraction events. Both of these solutions can ensure these events are captured, either as a BrowserInteraction event or as a PageAction event. However, they will not address recording the correct duration and related AJAX calls. Support If this solution does not resolve your issue, please file a support ticket, and have the following information available: For situations where you are seeing most route changes, but none for a particular route change you expect, attempt to evaluate the difference in the implementation of the code for that particular route. Is there something non-standard or unique about that route that you could provide to our support team? Document the frameworks and any libraries that might be of interest. If this is a new problem, has anything changed in your environment that has led to these interactions suddenly not being tracked? Note the browser agent version you are using. If you are more than a few releases behind, we will recommend that you update to the latest release, as we may have already resolved a similar issue. Be aware that due to the complexity of diagnosing these issues, the team will likely need access to an environment and code that demonstrates the problem for testing and research. Cause The browser agent attempts to be framework agnostic, as well as support coding best practices. However, there are often edge cases that will be missed that lead to you not collecting the route changes you expect. The implementation is based on instrumenting most common asynchronous browser APIs. There are cases when a web application uses some asynchronous API or uses custom or third-party code that we do not instrument, and this can result in inaccurate or missed route changes.",

The traditional window.onload page load timing still appears on the SPA Page views page. When you select a specific page load event, Window onload appears as a red line in the page load time chart. You can also select Switch to standard page views to return to traditional load timing displays. Timers The agent monitors all asynchronous calls, including timers. Timers with durations shorter than one second are wrapped. Timers longer than one second are not wrapped because usually they are meant for non-web transactions, such as background work or polling that is unrelated to a user interaction. Events and attributes We save browser interactions that lead to route changes and page loads as BrowserInteraction events, and AJAX requests as AjaxRequest events. You can query these events in the query builder.",

      "body": "Problem You are using the Pro + SPA agent, but you are not seeing all of the route change browser interactions you expect. We are aware that this can be frustrating. Our goal in summer 2020 is to reevaluate the SPA feature functionality, making it simpler and more reliable, starting with the methods we use to detect and capture route changes. Additionally, we plan to add new frameworks and use cases to our testing suite based on your feedback and examples. Likely this work will include new APIs as well as framework-specific plug-ins. Check our release notes for the latest updates. Solution Short term solutions To make sure all route changes are captured, you can use our SPA interaction() API. Using the interaction API will categorize the BrowserInteraction event (in the category attribute) as custom rather than a route change if no route change is in fact detected. If your framework is exposing events that represent router activity, you can use custom instrumentation in these events. Here is an example using our API with the Angular router: router.events.subscribe( (event: Event) => { if (event instanceof NavigationStart) { let i = newrelic.interaction() i.setName(event.url) i.save() } }); Copy In this example, the router object is an instance of the Angular router (from the @angular/router module). The setName call sets the name attribute of the BrowserInteraction event to the new URL, and the save call ensures that the interaction is captured. You will need to adapt this for the needs of your own application’s framework. If your framework does not provide routing events, then you can add this code in the event handler of the original interaction event such as click): myButton.addEventListener('click', function () { let i = newrelic.interaction() i.setName(‘new URL') i.save() }); Copy Recommendation: If you do not have access to router events nor the interaction event handler, implement this as soon as possible in code that you know is the result of a user interaction. An alternative to using the SPA API is to capture routes as PageAction events. PageAction events can be used to capture any custom data. We recommend this option as a fallback in case using the SPA interaction API does not work as expected, or to completely separate the custom instrumentation from built-in BrowserInteraction events. Both of these solutions can ensure these events are captured, either as a BrowserInteraction event or as a PageAction event. However, they will not address recording the correct duration and related AJAX calls. Support If this solution does not resolve your issue, please file a support ticket, and have the following information available: For situations where you are seeing most route changes, but none for a particular route change you expect, attempt to evaluate the difference in the implementation of the code for that particular route. Is there something non-standard or unique about that route that you could provide to our support team? Document the frameworks and any libraries that might be of interest. If this is a new problem, has anything changed in your environment that has led to these interactions suddenly not being tracked? Note the browser agent version you are using. If you are more than a few releases behind, we will recommend that you update to the latest release, as we may have already resolved a similar issue. Be aware that due to the complexity of diagnosing these issues, the team will likely need access to an environment and code that demonstrates the problem for testing and research. Cause The browser agent attempts to be framework agnostic, as well as support coding best practices. However, there are often edge cases that will be missed that lead to you not collecting the route changes you expect. The implementation is based on instrumenting most common asynchronous browser APIs. There are cases when a web application uses some asynchronous API or uses custom or third-party code that we do not instrument, and this can result in inaccurate or missed route changes.",

The app dynamically updates without requiring a full page reload, in response to user interactions with the app, such as clicking a button or submitting a request. Browser's SPA monitoring provides deeper visibility and actionable insights into real users' experiences with single-page apps. SPA monitoring is also valuable for any app that uses AJAX requests to pull content dynamically and create a fluid user experience. In addition to monitoring route changes automatically, you can use browser monitoring's SPA API to monitor virtually anything that executes inside the browser. This allows developers and their team to: Create faster, more responsive, highly interactive apps. Monitor the throughput and performance that real users are experiencing. Troubleshoot and resolve problems within the context of the page load. Query your data to assist with business decisions. Bring better apps to the marketplace more quickly. Enable SPA monitoring Before installing SPA monitoring, read SPA compatibility and requirements. Then, see Add apps to Single Page App monitoring.

For more about how New Relic handles SPA data, see Understand SPA data collection. Browser SPA features Here is a summary of SPA monitoring features: Single-page app monitoring Take advantage of these features Robust views in browser's UI When a user initiates a page load or route change, New Relic begins to monitor all subsequent JavaScript, and ends the timing once all AJAX events are complete. This provides a more accurate view of when a page is actually ready for a user compared to the traditional method of ending the timing when the window load event is fired. When SPA monitoring is enabled, the Page views page in browser shows event-driven data about application usage levels (throughput) and user experience (performance), including: Charts with drill-down details about initial page load performance, route changes, and historical performance Sort, search, and filter options, including custom attributes Additional AJAX breakdown data for all initial page loads and route changes For an explanation of how SPA monitoring will impact your existing browser account's data usage, see SPA and browser data usage.

      "body": "Important This doc explains our original product-based pricing plan. For more on pricing and user-related changes, see Overview of changes. Overview of original pricing New Relic has two pricing plans: a newer one called New Relic One pricing, and our original pricing plan. Our original pricing plan was based on subscriptions to specific products, like APM, Mobile, and Infrastructure. If you are on this pricing plan, your users are likely on our original user model and use these original user docs. To understand more about the new pricing and user changes, see Overview of changes. For accounts on original pricing, this doc includes: Explanation of how our original pricing plan works How to manage subscription and billing settings Annual vs monthly pricing plans Here are the differences between billed-annually and billed-monthly plans: Pricing plans Details Annual (best price) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a year for a committed number of hosts or compute units. You can increase this amount at any time, and charges will adjust with the next monthly bill. Your account will automatically renew at the end of the year unless you change your subscription. Early termination, downgrade, or decrease in service: Unless your order form states otherwise, you will be charged at the level and quantity of service ordered until the end of the then-current term if you cancel or downgrade to a lower level of service or fewer hosts during your commitment year. Monthly (no commitment) New Relic charges your credit card each month for a specified number of hosts or compute units. The account Owner can change the credit card number at any time: From the New Relic UI's account dropdown, select Account settings > Subscription. Your billing will adjust with your next monthly bill. Your account automatically renews each month unless you change your subscription. You can cancel service or downgrade to a lower level of service without penalty. APM and Infrastructure: Compute-unit vs host-based pricing New Relic APM offers a choice between two pricing models: compute unit (CU) based pricing and host-based pricing. New Relic Infrastructure offers only CU-based pricing. This section shows how both options are calculated, and explains what \"host\" means in these pricing contexts: Compute unit pricing CU-based pricing is available for these New Relic products: New Relic APM (choice of either CU-based pricing or host-based pricing) New Relic Infrastructure: only CU-based pricing With CU-based pricing, your monthly price is determined by the size of the host (computing power and memory) running New Relic and the number of hours it connects to New Relic during the month. If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the CU calculation. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a parent account with two children accounts, each running applications on the same host for 3,000 CUs in a given month, the usage for the parent account will be 6,000 CUs. For New Relic APM, CU-based pricing is the best choice if you have many cloud-based dynamic computing resources. For this reason, CU-based pricing is sometimes referred to as cloud pricing. CUs are calculated as follows: The maximum size of a given host (CPUs + GB RAM) is capped at 16. Examples: If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for one hour (or less than one hour), it consumes 4 CUs. If a host has 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM, and connects to New Relic for an entire month (750 hours used as standard month size), it consumes 3,000 CUs. You can purchase blocks of CUs to be consumed on a monthly basis. The total number of CUs purchased monthly is calculated by adding up the estimated CU consumption for all hosts for the month. There is no month-to-month rollover of unused CUs. Also, New Relic does not charge by JVMs, containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), or application instances--it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. Price points vary, depending on the New Relic product and subscription level. You can view CU-based account usage from the New Relic UI. Host-based pricing Tip Pricing for your New Relic APM account can be either CU-based or host-based. New Relic Infrastructure uses only CU-based pricing. With host-based pricing, New Relic charges based on the number of equivalent hosts used in a month. One equivalent host is defined as: a host connected to New Relic for 750 hours (750 hours used as standard month size). If a host is connected to New Relic at any time during an hour, that hour counts towards the host calculation. These hours can be divided across multiple hosts. For example, you might have three hosts that are each connected to New Relic for 250 hours during one month: these hours would add up to equal one equivalent host. Each host is counted separately for each New Relic account the host reports data to. For example, if you have a parent account with two child accounts, each running applications on the same single host for 750 hours in a given month, the usage for the parent account will be 2 equivalent hosts. Once connected to New Relic, hosts are distinguished by their unique hostnames. A host is connected to New Relic when the language agent is active and is deployed on the host. New Relic does not charge by containers (such as Docker or Cloud Foundry), JVMs, or application instances; it charges by the hosts running those containers or application instances. New Relic APM gives you a choice between host-based pricing and CU-based pricing. Host-based pricing is ideal if you have mainly static environments, consisting of hosts you manage in your own data center. For specifics on pricing amounts, see the APM pricing page. How is a \"host\" defined? To understand how New Relic computes both host-based pricing and CU-based pricing, it's important to understand how the word host is used. A host can be one of the following: A physical machine is a hardware-based device with dedicated physical resources, including memory, processing, and storage. Each machine has its own OS which applications run on. A virtual machine (VM) is the software implementation of a physical machine that executes programs like a physical machine. One or more virtual machines can run on a physical machine. Each virtual machine has its own OS and allocated virtual machine resources such as RAM and CPU. A cloud instance is a type of virtual machine that is run in the public cloud. In this context, virtual machines and cloud instances are different from Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and containers. For New Relic's pricing calculation purposes, a month is defined as 750 hours. Prorated billing If you upgrade your subscription partway through your billing period, you will be subject to a prorated charge for the higher level of service over the remainder of your billing period. This will be invoiced or charged to your credit card when the upgrade is submitted. You will be notified about this charge as part of the subscription change process. If you have questions, contact your New Relic account representative. If you need to report billing issues, contact New Relic's Billing Department. Manage subscription and billing settings Important Note that as of July 30 2020, we have a newer pricing plan. To learn more, see Overview of pricing. The account Owner can perform many subscription self-service functions directly from the user interface: From one.newrelic.com, select the account dropdown. Select your choice of self-service options. When making subscription changes, be sure to save any changes, agree to New Relic's Terms of Service and Supplemental Payment Terms as appropriate, and select Pay now. Optional: If you downgrade your subscription, complete New Relic's survey. Here is a summary of the available options from your account dropdown in the New Relic user interface: View summary information To view summary information about your subscription: From the account dropdown, select Account settings > Account > Summary. This includes: Account users and their roles (User, Admin, and Owner) or add-on roles Account name Subscription usage information Agent versions Billing credit card email License key Child accounts if applicable Subscriptions to New Relic products Tip Your account ID (which is not the same as your license key) is part of the URL after you sign in to New Relic.

      "body": "All New Relic Infrastructure accounts, regardless of subscription level, can use New Relic's Compute Engine integration to get a comprehensive, real-time view of their host's performance and status. New Relic Infrastructure's integration with Google Compute Engine reports metadata about instances (virtual machines) hosted on Google's infrastructure. You can monitor and alert on your GCP instances data from New Relic Infrastructure, and you can create custom queries and chart dashboards in New Relic Insights. Activate integration To enable the integration follow standard procedures to connect your GCP service to New Relic Infrastructure. Important You must install the Infrastructure agent on each GCE host to see metrics from that host. Connecting your Google Cloud projects allows Infrastructure to access GCE metadata, such as region, type, and tags. Polling frequency New Relic Infrastructure integrations query your GCP services according to a polling interval, which varies depending on the integration. The polling interval for the Google Compute Engine integration is 5 minutes. Find and use data After activating the integration and waiting a few minutes (based on the polling frequency), data will appear in the New Relic UI. To find and use your data, including links to your dashboards and alert settings, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP > (select an integration). Metric data Metric data that New Relic receives from your GCP Compute Engine integration include: GcpVirtualMachineSample Name Description firewall.DroppedBytes Delta count of incoming bytes dropped by the firewall. firewall.DroppedPackets Delta count of incoming packets dropped by the firewall. instance.cpu.ReservedCores Total number of cores reserved on the host of the instance.

      "body": "There are several ways New Relic lets you create your own integration: General telemetry (metrics, traces) solutions: Use our Telemetry SDKs. Build a custom New Relic One application that uses your own JavaScript UI functionality. If you have New Relic Infrastructure, you can use our lightweight Flex integration tool (recommended) or use our Integrations SDK to build a complete Infrastructure on-host integration. Important New Relic is transitioning to rely on open source standards like Prometheus for future on-host integrations. Though the infrastructure SDK is the foundation of that transition, some of the tutorials and tools around this SDK might not be up-to-date with the latest developments. What is the Integrations SDK? Our Infrastructure Integrations SDK lets you build an on-host integration that reports custom data from your hosts or services. That data can then be found in New Relic Infrastructure and can be used to create custom queries and charts. What data can you report with an on-host integration? When you build an integration using the Integrations SDK, you assign the entities that report data. In New Relic terms, entity is a purposefully ambiguous term meaning something that reports data to New Relic (for example: a local host, a load balancer, or a database). A single integration can report data from multiple entities, which gives you the ability to report data from more than one service or host instance. There are three types of data an entity can generate: Metrics: Metric data is used for numerical measurement data. Examples: how many requests are in a queue, or the number of hits on a database per minute. Metric data from a custom integration can be queried and used to create dashboards. Inventory: Live system state and configuration information. This data will show up on the Infrastructure Inventory UI page. Events: Events are used to record important activities on a system. Examples: a service starting or a new table being created. Event data will be shown in the Infrastructure Events UI page. Create a custom integration To create an integration using the Integrations SDK, use these resources: See the Go language build tools and tutorial. The tutorial walks you through creating a Redis integration in Go. (Note: Go is not required; it's just the language for which we provide additional build tools. For more information, see Integrations SDK requirements.) See the integration file structure documentation, which describes the files required to create an integration.",

This document explains the build tools and resources available for building an on-host integration with our Go language tools.

Find more information about the integration protocol v4 in the Github repository. The Go language integration-building tutorial on GitHub gives step-by-step procedures for building a Go language integration that reports Redis data. The tutorial shows how to build an integration using the Linux command line, but you can use the same techniques for a Windows integration with a standard Go install and PowerShell. The make command will not work with PowerShell, but you can use the Go commands inside it as a guide for building your integration. Tip You can create an on-host integration in any language, but Go is the language New Relic uses for its own integrations and build tools. To create an integration in another language, adhere to the integration file structures and JSON output requirements. Go language integration building package The tutorial relies on a New Relic Go language integration-building library package, which provides a set of useful Go functions and data structures. The package gives you tools that: Generate a \"scaffold\" integration structure with all the required fields. Read values from command-line arguments or environment variables. Generate and print JSON data to stdout. For information about file formats and JSON output specifications, see File requirements.",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. In December 2019, Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began supporting a newer configuration format that makes use of a single configuration file (instead of two separate files), and provides other improvements. This document will explain how this newer format works. The older standard configuration format is supported by current Infrastructure agents. For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration structure An on-host integration's configuration YAML must have an integrations top-level section containing a YAML array, where each entry represents an integration and its configuration. For each integration entry, only the name property is mandatory. The other properties are optional. Here's an example configuration featuring two integrations: our built-in Docker integration, which requires no configuration, and our MySQL integration: integrations: # New Relic integration that does not require any configuration - name: nri-docker # New Relic integration that gets its configuration from the environment - name: nri-mysql env: PORT: 3306 USERNAME: newrelic PASSWORD: 123456789 # to hide this field, read the secrets management documentation # Any free-form integration executed via a user-provided command - name: my-own-integration exec: python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy You can have as many configuration YAML files as you want and can group your integration instances. Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Each configuration YAML file can also contain discovery and variables top-level sections. Important This configuration format does not require an agent restart. When saved, changes are detected and implemented immediately. This means that saving intermediate configuration changes may cause the integration to stop working. List of configuration properties This is a list of the general properties used to configure an integration. For more details about using these properties, including example values, see the documentation following the table. Config Description name Name of the integration. This is the only mandatory configuration property across all on-host integrations. If the exec field is not set it will also be the name of the integration executable. cli_args Optional list of command line arguments when name is used to provide the integration executable. Available since agent version 1.13.0. exec Full path to the integration executable, plus arguments. It may be a single-line string or a string array. If left unspecified, the exec field defaults to the name field. env YAML map containing the environment variables to be passed to the integration, where key is the environment variable name, and value is the variable value. config Configuration that is written as an external file and the path that is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. config_template_path Any external file whose path is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. Its usage allows applying discovery and secrets binding to any external configuration. integration_user Name of the user who runs the integration. interval Time between consecutive executions of the integration. It must be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h), without spaces. inventory_source Allows overriding the category and term of the inventory source. labels Map with labels that decorate the data (metrics, events, inventory) reported by the integration. timeout A number followed by a time unit (ms, s, m or h). An integration that hasn't responded in this time period is killed and restarted. working_dir Working directory for the integration binary. when Integration is only executed if the clause evaluates to true. Conditions are defined below. The remainder of this document describes config properties grouped by their functionality: Select an integration to run Pass configuration to the integration command Configure how the agent executes integrations Select an integration to run There are two properties to select which integration will run: name and exec. The only mandatory property across all on-host integrations is name. The remaining properties specified in this document are optional. Example: integrations: - name: nri-docker - name: my-integration exec: /usr/local/bin/my-integration --metrics --inventory Copy name The mandatory name property can work in two ways: If the exec property is set: The name property only provides an identifier for the integration instance. This identifier is used in log messages and to provide a default inventory category/source in the form integration/<name> (for example, integration/nri-redis). This inventory path can be overridden with the inventory_source configuration option. If the exec property is not set: The agent looks for (and executes) an executable with the name value in any of the following folders: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations Windows C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\bin C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations If there is no executable with this name in the above folders the agent logs an error and the integration is not executed. Important In Windows, do not append the .exe extension to the name. The agent does this for you (for example, name: nri-mysql would look for nri-mysql.exe in the above folders). exec The exec optional property specifies the path, command, and command-line arguments of the integration to execute. When none of the path folders or arguments have spaces, it can be written in a single-line string: - name: my-integration exec: /usr/bin/python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy If any of the path/arguments have spaces that are part of a single element, you can use a YAML array notation: - name: my-integration exec: - C:\\Program Files\\My Integration\\integration.exe - --host - 127.0.0.1 - --port - 8080 Copy The default working directory is the root directory of the agent configuration. It can be overridden with the working_dir property. cli_args The cli_args optional property specifies command line arguments that should be passed to the integration. It is useful when using name as it only provides the integration name identifier (not compatible with exec). - name: my-integration cli_args: [ -interval 10s ] Copy Usual YAML multi-line list format can be used as well: - name: my-integration cli_args: - -interval - 10s Copy when The when property allows to execute the integration only when all the evaluated conditions are successful. Available conditions are: env_exists: Environment variables exist and match value. file_exists: Given file path exists. feature: Provided feature-flag is enabled. Example: integrations: - name: ssh-integration when: file_exists: /var/run/sshd.pid Copy Pass configuration to the integration executable Often integration executables need to receive a configuration to work properly (for example, hostname and port of the monitored system, user credentials, etc.). The Infrastructure agent allows you to configure the integration commands in three ways (which you can combine): Command-line arguments, passed in the exec property. Environment variables, using the env property. Configuration files, whose path needs to be passed through environment variables or command-line arguments (see the config) property. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/path/bin/script --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8081 - name: nri-mysql env: STATUS_URL: http://10.0.0.3/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true Copy env The env property allows you to set environment variables that are passed to the executable. It is a key-value map with the required variables. Example: integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: DATABASE: postgres PORT: 6432 COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false VERBOSE: 1 Copy If you expect your integration to receive the configuration from the host's environment rather than specifying it explicitly in the configuration file, you need to set the required variables in the Infrastructure agent passthrough_environment global configuration property config This section describes various ways to pass configuration information to an integration. Pass configuration file directly Some integration commands may get their configuration from an external file. If your integration requires a configuration file, nothing prevents you from directly passing its path directly as a command-line argument or an environment variable. Here's an example using configuration of our Flex integration: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: /etc/nri-flex/configs/http-service.yaml - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f /opt/integration/config.properties Copy The above example assumes that the http-service.yaml and config.properties files exist. We can see that the nri-flex integration is expecting the http-service.yaml complete path via the CONFIG_FILE environment variable and the other-integration expects the complete config.properties path after the -f command-line flag. In the above example, it's necessary for the integration installer/configurator that the configuration files exist in the provided path and that the agent and integrations have read permissions on them. Pass configuration through config section If you prefer to keep your configuration file with the rest of the integration configuration, you can use the config section in the integration entry, which can contain a valid YAML object or just a multi-line string: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f ${config.path} config: | example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostname=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy In the above examples, every time the nri-flex integration is executed, the agent creates a temporary file with the following contents: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy The above YAML is only a configuration example for the nri-flex integration. The agent ignores its contents; instead, it creates a temporary file and replaces the ${config.path} variable placeholder with its path. When the integration completes execution the temporary file is removed. Also, the agent creates another temporary file before executing the other-integration integration: example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostid=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy It replaces the -f ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary path of the written file. By convention, if you do not place the ${config.path} variable in any command-line argument or environment variable value, the agent passes the path of the configuration file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable: # assuming that nri-example command is prepared to receive the configuration # file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable integrations: - name: nri-example config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy Pass secrets and discovery through config section The main benefit for using a config section instead of hardcoding the full path of an external file is that you can insert ${variable} placeholders to apply our auto-discovery feature and secrets management. Here's an example followed by some explanations: variables: my_credentials: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token discovery: docker: match: label.service: foo integrations: - name: foo-monitor exec: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=${config.path} config: | foo.host=${discovery.ip} foo.port=${discovery.port} foo.user=${my_credentials.user} foo.password=${my_credentials.password} Copy Tip (For more details about the variables and discovery sections, please visit the discovery and secrets management documentation). The above example relies on the following premises: There is a Vault service that allows retrieving a JSON object formed by the user and password fields. There may be a variable number of Docker containers labeled with service=foo, which are accessible from the agent host via a discoverable public IP and Port. The user has configured the foo-monitor integration to monitor all the service=foo labeled containers, which share a common user and password. Each instance of the foo-monitor integration requires executing the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable, passing the text configuration inside the config section via the --config=<path> command-line argument. As example of workflow, imagine that the Vault invocation returns the following JSON: {\"user\":\"monitorer\",\"password\":\"5up3r53cr3t!\"} Copy At the moment of executing the foo-monitor integration, there are three running containers labeled with service=foo: ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8080 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8081 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8082 The agent then creates the following three temporary files, using the contents of the config property as a template, but replacing the ${placeholders} by the acquired variables and discovered items (files' path is invented for the sake of simplicity): First match (/tmp/123_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8080 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Second match (/tmp/456_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8081 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Third match (/tmp/789_discovered) foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8082 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy After the config variable placeholders have been replaced and the temporary files have been created, the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable is executed three times (one per matched container), replacing the ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary file corresponding to each discovered configuration: First match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/123_discovered Second match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/456_discovered Third match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/789_discovered To ensure security and to minimize the chance of leaking secrets to disk, the agent: Creates the files owned by the agent user, for example, root or nri-agent, depending on the user you have configured to run the agent. Sets read permissions only for the owner. Removes the created files when the integration instance finishes its execution. config_template_path If you want to use the secrets management and discovery in the configuration files that you're passing to the integration executable, but you prefer to keep them as an individual file, you can use the config_template_path: <path> option. It works exactly as in the config section: The agent applies secrets management and discovery to the file contents. The agent creates different temporary files that are passed to the integration via the ${config.path} placeholder (or the CONFIG_PATH environment variable). Example: discovery: docker: match: name: /^redis/ integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config_template_path: /etc/flex-configs/redis.yml Copy In the above example, the redis.yml external file can contain container discovery variable placeholders, like ${discovery.ip} or ${discovery.port}. Configure how the agent executes your integrations The properties of this section modify the way the Infrastructure agent executes and interacts with the integrations, or the way the agent decorates the integrations' data. integration_user The integration commands run as the same user as the agent (usually root or nri-agent). If due to permission restrictions an integration needs to run as another user, its name must be specified in the integration_user property. Example: integrations: - name: dbus-inventory exec: python my-dbus-script.py integration_user: dbus Copy interval The interval option sets the time between consecutive executions of an integration. The accepted format is an integer immediately followed by a time unit (s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). The default is 30s, and the minimum accepted value is 15s. Any value lower than 15s is automatically set to 15s. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover interval: 20s Copy inventory_source Any inventory item must be catalogued under a category/source taxonomy. By default, each integration inventory is stored as integration/ + name value (for example, integration/nri-apache, integration/nri-mysql). The inventory_source property allows you to override the default taxonomy of inventory data. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx - name: nri-apache exec: - /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/nri-apache - --inventory inventory_source: config/apache Copy In the above example, the nri-nginx inventory, if any, would be visible in the New Relic UI under the integration/nri-nginx source. The nri-apache inventory would be visible under config/apache. labels labels is a key-value map that allows extra metadata to be provided for the integration. The agent uses those labels to decorate the metrics, events, and inventory that it receives from a given integration instance. Example: integrations: - name: nri-apache inventory_source: config/apache labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy In the above example, the agent decorates all the metrics and events from the nri-apache instance with the following fields: label.env: production label.role: load_balancer Also, the following entries are added to the integration inventory: config/apache/labels/env: production config/apache/labels/role: load_balancer timeout If an integration has not returned any metric (or a heartbeat message as described below) before the time specified in the timeout value, the agent kills the integration process and restarts it after the corresponding interval. The accepted format is an integer number immediately followed (without spaces) by a time unit (ms for milliseconds, s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). If a zero (or negative) timeout value is provided, the integration can run forever without being killed by a timeout expiration. For long-running integrations (integrations that keep running, periodically returning metrics/events/inventory), each time the integration submits a metrics/events/inventory payload, the timeout deadline is restarted. That means that long-running integrations must return a valid JSON payload in an interval that is lower than timeout. Returning an empty JSON ({}) is interpreted as a heart-beat message that restarts the timeout, preventing the long-running integration from being killed, even if they don't have information to report. The default is 120s, and the minimum accepted value is 100ms. Any value lower than 100ms is automatically set to 100ms. Example: integrations: - name: nri-jmx arguments: JMX_HOST: jmx-host.localnet JMX_PORT: 7096 COLLECTION_FILES: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml\" timeout: 30s Copy working_dir working_dir sets the working directory of the command. If empty or unspecified, the agent runs the command in the Infrastructure agent's current directory. The default is the Infrastructure agent root directory. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/integration/bin/integration working_dir: /opt/integration/scratch-zone Copy Update older integration configuration In December 2019, the Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began using a different configuration format. For details, see Config format differences. The main difference between these formats is that the older configuration format uses two separate configuration files (a INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml file and a INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml file) and the newer version uses a single configuration file. Here are some of the features added by the newer configuration functionality: Flexible configuration via command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files. Ability to group different integrations in the same file. Hot reload: adding a new integration or changing its configuration does not require restarting the agent. Timeouts: if an integration doesn't respond before a user-specified time, the integration process is killed and restarted. Not all on-host integrations come with the newer configuration format, but you can update the configuration to the new format for all on-host integrations to take advantage of the new features. The following YAML shows an example Apache integration configuration using the older configuration format. Note that this configuration will still work with newer agents, but we recommend updating your integrations to take full advantage of features. integration_name: com.newrelic.apache instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy To update an older integration configuration to the new format, you must perform two steps: Rename the instances top-level section to integrations. Remove the integration_name top-level section and add it to each integration entry. You are no longer required to keep a separate file for each integration type and you can group your legacy integration entries in the same file as other integrations. The new version of the Apache integration config: integrations: - name: apache-server-metrics integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Please note that because the older configuration format doesn't support hot reloading. You will need to restart the Infrastructure agent to remove the old integrations configuration (otherwise the old instances will coexist with the new ones).",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. In December 2019, Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began supporting a newer configuration format that makes use of a single configuration file (instead of two separate files), and provides other improvements. This document will explain how this newer format works. The older standard configuration format is supported by current Infrastructure agents. For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration structure An on-host integration's configuration YAML must have an integrations top-level section containing a YAML array, where each entry represents an integration and its configuration. For each integration entry, only the name property is mandatory. The other properties are optional. Here's an example configuration featuring two integrations: our built-in Docker integration, which requires no configuration, and our MySQL integration: integrations: # New Relic integration that does not require any configuration - name: nri-docker # New Relic integration that gets its configuration from the environment - name: nri-mysql env: PORT: 3306 USERNAME: newrelic PASSWORD: 123456789 # to hide this field, read the secrets management documentation # Any free-form integration executed via a user-provided command - name: my-own-integration exec: python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy You can have as many configuration YAML files as you want and can group your integration instances. Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Each configuration YAML file can also contain discovery and variables top-level sections. Important This configuration format does not require an agent restart. When saved, changes are detected and implemented immediately. This means that saving intermediate configuration changes may cause the integration to stop working. List of configuration properties This is a list of the general properties used to configure an integration. For more details about using these properties, including example values, see the documentation following the table. Config Description name Name of the integration. This is the only mandatory configuration property across all on-host integrations. If the exec field is not set it will also be the name of the integration executable. cli_args Optional list of command line arguments when name is used to provide the integration executable. Available since agent version 1.13.0. exec Full path to the integration executable, plus arguments. It may be a single-line string or a string array. If left unspecified, the exec field defaults to the name field. env YAML map containing the environment variables to be passed to the integration, where key is the environment variable name, and value is the variable value. config Configuration that is written as an external file and the path that is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. config_template_path Any external file whose path is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. Its usage allows applying discovery and secrets binding to any external configuration. integration_user Name of the user who runs the integration. interval Time between consecutive executions of the integration. It must be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h), without spaces. inventory_source Allows overriding the category and term of the inventory source. labels Map with labels that decorate the data (metrics, events, inventory) reported by the integration. timeout A number followed by a time unit (ms, s, m or h). An integration that hasn't responded in this time period is killed and restarted. working_dir Working directory for the integration binary. when Integration is only executed if the clause evaluates to true. Conditions are defined below. The remainder of this document describes config properties grouped by their functionality: Select an integration to run Pass configuration to the integration command Configure how the agent executes integrations Select an integration to run There are two properties to select which integration will run: name and exec. The only mandatory property across all on-host integrations is name. The remaining properties specified in this document are optional. Example: integrations: - name: nri-docker - name: my-integration exec: /usr/local/bin/my-integration --metrics --inventory Copy name The mandatory name property can work in two ways: If the exec property is set: The name property only provides an identifier for the integration instance. This identifier is used in log messages and to provide a default inventory category/source in the form integration/<name> (for example, integration/nri-redis). This inventory path can be overridden with the inventory_source configuration option. If the exec property is not set: The agent looks for (and executes) an executable with the name value in any of the following folders: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations Windows C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\bin C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations If there is no executable with this name in the above folders the agent logs an error and the integration is not executed. Important In Windows, do not append the .exe extension to the name. The agent does this for you (for example, name: nri-mysql would look for nri-mysql.exe in the above folders). exec The exec optional property specifies the path, command, and command-line arguments of the integration to execute. When none of the path folders or arguments have spaces, it can be written in a single-line string: - name: my-integration exec: /usr/bin/python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy If any of the path/arguments have spaces that are part of a single element, you can use a YAML array notation: - name: my-integration exec: - C:\\Program Files\\My Integration\\integration.exe - --host - 127.0.0.1 - --port - 8080 Copy The default working directory is the root directory of the agent configuration. It can be overridden with the working_dir property. cli_args The cli_args optional property specifies command line arguments that should be passed to the integration. It is useful when using name as it only provides the integration name identifier (not compatible with exec). - name: my-integration cli_args: [ -interval 10s ] Copy Usual YAML multi-line list format can be used as well: - name: my-integration cli_args: - -interval - 10s Copy when The when property allows to execute the integration only when all the evaluated conditions are successful. Available conditions are: env_exists: Environment variables exist and match value. file_exists: Given file path exists. feature: Provided feature-flag is enabled. Example: integrations: - name: ssh-integration when: file_exists: /var/run/sshd.pid Copy Pass configuration to the integration executable Often integration executables need to receive a configuration to work properly (for example, hostname and port of the monitored system, user credentials, etc.). The Infrastructure agent allows you to configure the integration commands in three ways (which you can combine): Command-line arguments, passed in the exec property. Environment variables, using the env property. Configuration files, whose path needs to be passed through environment variables or command-line arguments (see the config) property. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/path/bin/script --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8081 - name: nri-mysql env: STATUS_URL: http://10.0.0.3/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true Copy env The env property allows you to set environment variables that are passed to the executable. It is a key-value map with the required variables. Example: integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: DATABASE: postgres PORT: 6432 COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false VERBOSE: 1 Copy If you expect your integration to receive the configuration from the host's environment rather than specifying it explicitly in the configuration file, you need to set the required variables in the Infrastructure agent passthrough_environment global configuration property config This section describes various ways to pass configuration information to an integration. Pass configuration file directly Some integration commands may get their configuration from an external file. If your integration requires a configuration file, nothing prevents you from directly passing its path directly as a command-line argument or an environment variable. Here's an example using configuration of our Flex integration: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: /etc/nri-flex/configs/http-service.yaml - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f /opt/integration/config.properties Copy The above example assumes that the http-service.yaml and config.properties files exist. We can see that the nri-flex integration is expecting the http-service.yaml complete path via the CONFIG_FILE environment variable and the other-integration expects the complete config.properties path after the -f command-line flag. In the above example, it's necessary for the integration installer/configurator that the configuration files exist in the provided path and that the agent and integrations have read permissions on them. Pass configuration through config section If you prefer to keep your configuration file with the rest of the integration configuration, you can use the config section in the integration entry, which can contain a valid YAML object or just a multi-line string: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f ${config.path} config: | example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostname=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy In the above examples, every time the nri-flex integration is executed, the agent creates a temporary file with the following contents: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy The above YAML is only a configuration example for the nri-flex integration. The agent ignores its contents; instead, it creates a temporary file and replaces the ${config.path} variable placeholder with its path. When the integration completes execution the temporary file is removed. Also, the agent creates another temporary file before executing the other-integration integration: example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostid=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy It replaces the -f ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary path of the written file. By convention, if you do not place the ${config.path} variable in any command-line argument or environment variable value, the agent passes the path of the configuration file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable: # assuming that nri-example command is prepared to receive the configuration # file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable integrations: - name: nri-example config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy Pass secrets and discovery through config section The main benefit for using a config section instead of hardcoding the full path of an external file is that you can insert ${variable} placeholders to apply our auto-discovery feature and secrets management. Here's an example followed by some explanations: variables: my_credentials: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token discovery: docker: match: label.service: foo integrations: - name: foo-monitor exec: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=${config.path} config: | foo.host=${discovery.ip} foo.port=${discovery.port} foo.user=${my_credentials.user} foo.password=${my_credentials.password} Copy Tip (For more details about the variables and discovery sections, please visit the discovery and secrets management documentation). The above example relies on the following premises: There is a Vault service that allows retrieving a JSON object formed by the user and password fields. There may be a variable number of Docker containers labeled with service=foo, which are accessible from the agent host via a discoverable public IP and Port. The user has configured the foo-monitor integration to monitor all the service=foo labeled containers, which share a common user and password. Each instance of the foo-monitor integration requires executing the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable, passing the text configuration inside the config section via the --config=<path> command-line argument. As example of workflow, imagine that the Vault invocation returns the following JSON: {\"user\":\"monitorer\",\"password\":\"5up3r53cr3t!\"} Copy At the moment of executing the foo-monitor integration, there are three running containers labeled with service=foo: ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8080 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8081 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8082 The agent then creates the following three temporary files, using the contents of the config property as a template, but replacing the ${placeholders} by the acquired variables and discovered items (files' path is invented for the sake of simplicity): First match (/tmp/123_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8080 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Second match (/tmp/456_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8081 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Third match (/tmp/789_discovered) foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8082 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy After the config variable placeholders have been replaced and the temporary files have been created, the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable is executed three times (one per matched container), replacing the ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary file corresponding to each discovered configuration: First match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/123_discovered Second match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/456_discovered Third match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/789_discovered To ensure security and to minimize the chance of leaking secrets to disk, the agent: Creates the files owned by the agent user, for example, root or nri-agent, depending on the user you have configured to run the agent. Sets read permissions only for the owner. Removes the created files when the integration instance finishes its execution. config_template_path If you want to use the secrets management and discovery in the configuration files that you're passing to the integration executable, but you prefer to keep them as an individual file, you can use the config_template_path: <path> option. It works exactly as in the config section: The agent applies secrets management and discovery to the file contents. The agent creates different temporary files that are passed to the integration via the ${config.path} placeholder (or the CONFIG_PATH environment variable). Example: discovery: docker: match: name: /^redis/ integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config_template_path: /etc/flex-configs/redis.yml Copy In the above example, the redis.yml external file can contain container discovery variable placeholders, like ${discovery.ip} or ${discovery.port}. Configure how the agent executes your integrations The properties of this section modify the way the Infrastructure agent executes and interacts with the integrations, or the way the agent decorates the integrations' data. integration_user The integration commands run as the same user as the agent (usually root or nri-agent). If due to permission restrictions an integration needs to run as another user, its name must be specified in the integration_user property. Example: integrations: - name: dbus-inventory exec: python my-dbus-script.py integration_user: dbus Copy interval The interval option sets the time between consecutive executions of an integration. The accepted format is an integer immediately followed by a time unit (s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). The default is 30s, and the minimum accepted value is 15s. Any value lower than 15s is automatically set to 15s. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover interval: 20s Copy inventory_source Any inventory item must be catalogued under a category/source taxonomy. By default, each integration inventory is stored as integration/ + name value (for example, integration/nri-apache, integration/nri-mysql). The inventory_source property allows you to override the default taxonomy of inventory data. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx - name: nri-apache exec: - /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/nri-apache - --inventory inventory_source: config/apache Copy In the above example, the nri-nginx inventory, if any, would be visible in the New Relic UI under the integration/nri-nginx source. The nri-apache inventory would be visible under config/apache. labels labels is a key-value map that allows extra metadata to be provided for the integration. The agent uses those labels to decorate the metrics, events, and inventory that it receives from a given integration instance. Example: integrations: - name: nri-apache inventory_source: config/apache labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy In the above example, the agent decorates all the metrics and events from the nri-apache instance with the following fields: label.env: production label.role: load_balancer Also, the following entries are added to the integration inventory: config/apache/labels/env: production config/apache/labels/role: load_balancer timeout If an integration has not returned any metric (or a heartbeat message as described below) before the time specified in the timeout value, the agent kills the integration process and restarts it after the corresponding interval. The accepted format is an integer number immediately followed (without spaces) by a time unit (ms for milliseconds, s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). If a zero (or negative) timeout value is provided, the integration can run forever without being killed by a timeout expiration. For long-running integrations (integrations that keep running, periodically returning metrics/events/inventory), each time the integration submits a metrics/events/inventory payload, the timeout deadline is restarted. That means that long-running integrations must return a valid JSON payload in an interval that is lower than timeout. Returning an empty JSON ({}) is interpreted as a heart-beat message that restarts the timeout, preventing the long-running integration from being killed, even if they don't have information to report. The default is 120s, and the minimum accepted value is 100ms. Any value lower than 100ms is automatically set to 100ms. Example: integrations: - name: nri-jmx arguments: JMX_HOST: jmx-host.localnet JMX_PORT: 7096 COLLECTION_FILES: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml\" timeout: 30s Copy working_dir working_dir sets the working directory of the command. If empty or unspecified, the agent runs the command in the Infrastructure agent's current directory. The default is the Infrastructure agent root directory. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/integration/bin/integration working_dir: /opt/integration/scratch-zone Copy Update older integration configuration In December 2019, the Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began using a different configuration format. For details, see Config format differences. The main difference between these formats is that the older configuration format uses two separate configuration files (a INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml file and a INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml file) and the newer version uses a single configuration file. Here are some of the features added by the newer configuration functionality: Flexible configuration via command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files. Ability to group different integrations in the same file. Hot reload: adding a new integration or changing its configuration does not require restarting the agent. Timeouts: if an integration doesn't respond before a user-specified time, the integration process is killed and restarted. Not all on-host integrations come with the newer configuration format, but you can update the configuration to the new format for all on-host integrations to take advantage of the new features. The following YAML shows an example Apache integration configuration using the older configuration format. Note that this configuration will still work with newer agents, but we recommend updating your integrations to take full advantage of features. integration_name: com.newrelic.apache instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy To update an older integration configuration to the new format, you must perform two steps: Rename the instances top-level section to integrations. Remove the integration_name top-level section and add it to each integration entry. You are no longer required to keep a separate file for each integration type and you can group your legacy integration entries in the same file as other integrations. The new version of the Apache integration config: integrations: - name: apache-server-metrics integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Please note that because the older configuration format doesn't support hot reloading. You will need to restart the Infrastructure agent to remove the old integrations configuration (otherwise the old instances will coexist with the new ones).",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. In December 2019, Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began supporting a newer configuration format that makes use of a single configuration file (instead of two separate files), and provides other improvements. This document will explain how this newer format works. The older standard configuration format is supported by current Infrastructure agents. For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration structure An on-host integration's configuration YAML must have an integrations top-level section containing a YAML array, where each entry represents an integration and its configuration. For each integration entry, only the name property is mandatory. The other properties are optional. Here's an example configuration featuring two integrations: our built-in Docker integration, which requires no configuration, and our MySQL integration: integrations: # New Relic integration that does not require any configuration - name: nri-docker # New Relic integration that gets its configuration from the environment - name: nri-mysql env: PORT: 3306 USERNAME: newrelic PASSWORD: 123456789 # to hide this field, read the secrets management documentation # Any free-form integration executed via a user-provided command - name: my-own-integration exec: python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy You can have as many configuration YAML files as you want and can group your integration instances. Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Each configuration YAML file can also contain discovery and variables top-level sections. Important This configuration format does not require an agent restart. When saved, changes are detected and implemented immediately. This means that saving intermediate configuration changes may cause the integration to stop working. List of configuration properties This is a list of the general properties used to configure an integration. For more details about using these properties, including example values, see the documentation following the table. Config Description name Name of the integration. This is the only mandatory configuration property across all on-host integrations. If the exec field is not set it will also be the name of the integration executable. cli_args Optional list of command line arguments when name is used to provide the integration executable. Available since agent version 1.13.0. exec Full path to the integration executable, plus arguments. It may be a single-line string or a string array. If left unspecified, the exec field defaults to the name field. env YAML map containing the environment variables to be passed to the integration, where key is the environment variable name, and value is the variable value. config Configuration that is written as an external file and the path that is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. config_template_path Any external file whose path is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. Its usage allows applying discovery and secrets binding to any external configuration. integration_user Name of the user who runs the integration. interval Time between consecutive executions of the integration. It must be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h), without spaces. inventory_source Allows overriding the category and term of the inventory source. labels Map with labels that decorate the data (metrics, events, inventory) reported by the integration. timeout A number followed by a time unit (ms, s, m or h). An integration that hasn't responded in this time period is killed and restarted. working_dir Working directory for the integration binary. when Integration is only executed if the clause evaluates to true. Conditions are defined below. The remainder of this document describes config properties grouped by their functionality: Select an integration to run Pass configuration to the integration command Configure how the agent executes integrations Select an integration to run There are two properties to select which integration will run: name and exec. The only mandatory property across all on-host integrations is name. The remaining properties specified in this document are optional. Example: integrations: - name: nri-docker - name: my-integration exec: /usr/local/bin/my-integration --metrics --inventory Copy name The mandatory name property can work in two ways: If the exec property is set: The name property only provides an identifier for the integration instance. This identifier is used in log messages and to provide a default inventory category/source in the form integration/<name> (for example, integration/nri-redis). This inventory path can be overridden with the inventory_source configuration option. If the exec property is not set: The agent looks for (and executes) an executable with the name value in any of the following folders: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations Windows C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\bin C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations If there is no executable with this name in the above folders the agent logs an error and the integration is not executed. Important In Windows, do not append the .exe extension to the name. The agent does this for you (for example, name: nri-mysql would look for nri-mysql.exe in the above folders). exec The exec optional property specifies the path, command, and command-line arguments of the integration to execute. When none of the path folders or arguments have spaces, it can be written in a single-line string: - name: my-integration exec: /usr/bin/python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy If any of the path/arguments have spaces that are part of a single element, you can use a YAML array notation: - name: my-integration exec: - C:\\Program Files\\My Integration\\integration.exe - --host - 127.0.0.1 - --port - 8080 Copy The default working directory is the root directory of the agent configuration. It can be overridden with the working_dir property. cli_args The cli_args optional property specifies command line arguments that should be passed to the integration. It is useful when using name as it only provides the integration name identifier (not compatible with exec). - name: my-integration cli_args: [ -interval 10s ] Copy Usual YAML multi-line list format can be used as well: - name: my-integration cli_args: - -interval - 10s Copy when The when property allows to execute the integration only when all the evaluated conditions are successful. Available conditions are: env_exists: Environment variables exist and match value. file_exists: Given file path exists. feature: Provided feature-flag is enabled. Example: integrations: - name: ssh-integration when: file_exists: /var/run/sshd.pid Copy Pass configuration to the integration executable Often integration executables need to receive a configuration to work properly (for example, hostname and port of the monitored system, user credentials, etc.). The Infrastructure agent allows you to configure the integration commands in three ways (which you can combine): Command-line arguments, passed in the exec property. Environment variables, using the env property. Configuration files, whose path needs to be passed through environment variables or command-line arguments (see the config) property. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/path/bin/script --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8081 - name: nri-mysql env: STATUS_URL: http://10.0.0.3/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true Copy env The env property allows you to set environment variables that are passed to the executable. It is a key-value map with the required variables. Example: integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: DATABASE: postgres PORT: 6432 COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false VERBOSE: 1 Copy If you expect your integration to receive the configuration from the host's environment rather than specifying it explicitly in the configuration file, you need to set the required variables in the Infrastructure agent passthrough_environment global configuration property config This section describes various ways to pass configuration information to an integration. Pass configuration file directly Some integration commands may get their configuration from an external file. If your integration requires a configuration file, nothing prevents you from directly passing its path directly as a command-line argument or an environment variable. Here's an example using configuration of our Flex integration: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: /etc/nri-flex/configs/http-service.yaml - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f /opt/integration/config.properties Copy The above example assumes that the http-service.yaml and config.properties files exist. We can see that the nri-flex integration is expecting the http-service.yaml complete path via the CONFIG_FILE environment variable and the other-integration expects the complete config.properties path after the -f command-line flag. In the above example, it's necessary for the integration installer/configurator that the configuration files exist in the provided path and that the agent and integrations have read permissions on them. Pass configuration through config section If you prefer to keep your configuration file with the rest of the integration configuration, you can use the config section in the integration entry, which can contain a valid YAML object or just a multi-line string: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f ${config.path} config: | example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostname=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy In the above examples, every time the nri-flex integration is executed, the agent creates a temporary file with the following contents: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy The above YAML is only a configuration example for the nri-flex integration. The agent ignores its contents; instead, it creates a temporary file and replaces the ${config.path} variable placeholder with its path. When the integration completes execution the temporary file is removed. Also, the agent creates another temporary file before executing the other-integration integration: example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostid=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy It replaces the -f ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary path of the written file. By convention, if you do not place the ${config.path} variable in any command-line argument or environment variable value, the agent passes the path of the configuration file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable: # assuming that nri-example command is prepared to receive the configuration # file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable integrations: - name: nri-example config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy Pass secrets and discovery through config section The main benefit for using a config section instead of hardcoding the full path of an external file is that you can insert ${variable} placeholders to apply our auto-discovery feature and secrets management. Here's an example followed by some explanations: variables: my_credentials: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token discovery: docker: match: label.service: foo integrations: - name: foo-monitor exec: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=${config.path} config: | foo.host=${discovery.ip} foo.port=${discovery.port} foo.user=${my_credentials.user} foo.password=${my_credentials.password} Copy Tip (For more details about the variables and discovery sections, please visit the discovery and secrets management documentation). The above example relies on the following premises: There is a Vault service that allows retrieving a JSON object formed by the user and password fields. There may be a variable number of Docker containers labeled with service=foo, which are accessible from the agent host via a discoverable public IP and Port. The user has configured the foo-monitor integration to monitor all the service=foo labeled containers, which share a common user and password. Each instance of the foo-monitor integration requires executing the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable, passing the text configuration inside the config section via the --config=<path> command-line argument. As example of workflow, imagine that the Vault invocation returns the following JSON: {\"user\":\"monitorer\",\"password\":\"5up3r53cr3t!\"} Copy At the moment of executing the foo-monitor integration, there are three running containers labeled with service=foo: ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8080 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8081 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8082 The agent then creates the following three temporary files, using the contents of the config property as a template, but replacing the ${placeholders} by the acquired variables and discovered items (files' path is invented for the sake of simplicity): First match (/tmp/123_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8080 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Second match (/tmp/456_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8081 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Third match (/tmp/789_discovered) foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8082 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy After the config variable placeholders have been replaced and the temporary files have been created, the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable is executed three times (one per matched container), replacing the ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary file corresponding to each discovered configuration: First match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/123_discovered Second match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/456_discovered Third match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/789_discovered To ensure security and to minimize the chance of leaking secrets to disk, the agent: Creates the files owned by the agent user, for example, root or nri-agent, depending on the user you have configured to run the agent. Sets read permissions only for the owner. Removes the created files when the integration instance finishes its execution. config_template_path If you want to use the secrets management and discovery in the configuration files that you're passing to the integration executable, but you prefer to keep them as an individual file, you can use the config_template_path: <path> option. It works exactly as in the config section: The agent applies secrets management and discovery to the file contents. The agent creates different temporary files that are passed to the integration via the ${config.path} placeholder (or the CONFIG_PATH environment variable). Example: discovery: docker: match: name: /^redis/ integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config_template_path: /etc/flex-configs/redis.yml Copy In the above example, the redis.yml external file can contain container discovery variable placeholders, like ${discovery.ip} or ${discovery.port}. Configure how the agent executes your integrations The properties of this section modify the way the Infrastructure agent executes and interacts with the integrations, or the way the agent decorates the integrations' data. integration_user The integration commands run as the same user as the agent (usually root or nri-agent). If due to permission restrictions an integration needs to run as another user, its name must be specified in the integration_user property. Example: integrations: - name: dbus-inventory exec: python my-dbus-script.py integration_user: dbus Copy interval The interval option sets the time between consecutive executions of an integration. The accepted format is an integer immediately followed by a time unit (s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). The default is 30s, and the minimum accepted value is 15s. Any value lower than 15s is automatically set to 15s. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover interval: 20s Copy inventory_source Any inventory item must be catalogued under a category/source taxonomy. By default, each integration inventory is stored as integration/ + name value (for example, integration/nri-apache, integration/nri-mysql). The inventory_source property allows you to override the default taxonomy of inventory data. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx - name: nri-apache exec: - /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/nri-apache - --inventory inventory_source: config/apache Copy In the above example, the nri-nginx inventory, if any, would be visible in the New Relic UI under the integration/nri-nginx source. The nri-apache inventory would be visible under config/apache. labels labels is a key-value map that allows extra metadata to be provided for the integration. The agent uses those labels to decorate the metrics, events, and inventory that it receives from a given integration instance. Example: integrations: - name: nri-apache inventory_source: config/apache labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy In the above example, the agent decorates all the metrics and events from the nri-apache instance with the following fields: label.env: production label.role: load_balancer Also, the following entries are added to the integration inventory: config/apache/labels/env: production config/apache/labels/role: load_balancer timeout If an integration has not returned any metric (or a heartbeat message as described below) before the time specified in the timeout value, the agent kills the integration process and restarts it after the corresponding interval. The accepted format is an integer number immediately followed (without spaces) by a time unit (ms for milliseconds, s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). If a zero (or negative) timeout value is provided, the integration can run forever without being killed by a timeout expiration. For long-running integrations (integrations that keep running, periodically returning metrics/events/inventory), each time the integration submits a metrics/events/inventory payload, the timeout deadline is restarted. That means that long-running integrations must return a valid JSON payload in an interval that is lower than timeout. Returning an empty JSON ({}) is interpreted as a heart-beat message that restarts the timeout, preventing the long-running integration from being killed, even if they don't have information to report. The default is 120s, and the minimum accepted value is 100ms. Any value lower than 100ms is automatically set to 100ms. Example: integrations: - name: nri-jmx arguments: JMX_HOST: jmx-host.localnet JMX_PORT: 7096 COLLECTION_FILES: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml\" timeout: 30s Copy working_dir working_dir sets the working directory of the command. If empty or unspecified, the agent runs the command in the Infrastructure agent's current directory. The default is the Infrastructure agent root directory. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/integration/bin/integration working_dir: /opt/integration/scratch-zone Copy Update older integration configuration In December 2019, the Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began using a different configuration format. For details, see Config format differences. The main difference between these formats is that the older configuration format uses two separate configuration files (a INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml file and a INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml file) and the newer version uses a single configuration file. Here are some of the features added by the newer configuration functionality: Flexible configuration via command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files. Ability to group different integrations in the same file. Hot reload: adding a new integration or changing its configuration does not require restarting the agent. Timeouts: if an integration doesn't respond before a user-specified time, the integration process is killed and restarted. Not all on-host integrations come with the newer configuration format, but you can update the configuration to the new format for all on-host integrations to take advantage of the new features. The following YAML shows an example Apache integration configuration using the older configuration format. Note that this configuration will still work with newer agents, but we recommend updating your integrations to take full advantage of features. integration_name: com.newrelic.apache instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy To update an older integration configuration to the new format, you must perform two steps: Rename the instances top-level section to integrations. Remove the integration_name top-level section and add it to each integration entry. You are no longer required to keep a separate file for each integration type and you can group your legacy integration entries in the same file as other integrations. The new version of the Apache integration config: integrations: - name: apache-server-metrics integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Please note that because the older configuration format doesn't support hot reloading. You will need to restart the Infrastructure agent to remove the old integrations configuration (otherwise the old instances will coexist with the new ones).",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. This document explains the older, standard configuration format. This format is used by most on-host integrations and is supported by newer Infrastructure agents (which also support a newer, improved configuration format). For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration file structure An on-host integration that uses the standard configuration format requires two configuration files: A definition file A configuration file Definition file The definition file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml. This file provides descriptive information about the integration, such as: the version of the JSON protocol it supports, a list of commands it can execute, and arguments that it accepts. It lives in this directory: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations Copy Here's an example of an NGINX integration definition file with two command sections on a Linux system: name: com.myorg.nginx protocol_version: 2 description: Collect metric and configuration data from NGINX os: linux commands: metrics: command: - myorg-nginx - --metrics interval: 15 inventory: command: - myorg-nginx - --inventory interval: 120 prefix: integration/myorg-nginx Copy A definition file can be broken down into two parts: The header The commands section Definition file header Here are explanations of a definition file's header elements: Definition header field Description name Required. A unique name name to identify the integration for logging, internal metrics, etc. When the agent loads the config file, New Relic uses the name to look up the integration in the agent's registry. protocol_version Required. The version number of the protocol. New Relic uses this to ensure compatibility between the integration and the agent. If the agent does not recognize an integration's version, it will filter out that integration and create a log message. The current version of the JSON protocol is 2. For more on protocol changes, see SDK changes. description Optional. Human-friendly explanation of what the integration does. os Optional. The operating system where the integration runs. New Relic uses this to filter integrations that you intend to run only on specific operating systems. Default: Run the integration regardless of the os value. To restrict the integration to a specific operating system, use either of these options: linux windows Definition file commands After the header is a list of commands. The commands section defines: One or more independent operating modes for the executable The runtime data required for it to be executed The commands section is a YAML map of command definitions, where each key is the unique alias name of the command in the integration's config file that specifies the executable to run. Definition commands Description command Required. The actual command line to be executed as a YAML array of command parts. These are assembled to run the actual command. For simple commands, the array might be only a single element. Additional command rules include: command arguments: The command and any command line arguments that are shared for all instances of the integration configuration. command execution: The command will be executed in the same directory as the definition file. command path: Any commands available on the host's $PATH can be used. Executables located in the same directory as the definition file, or in a subdirectory of it, can be executed using a relative path. For example: Linux: To run an executable called myorg-nginx in the same directory as the definition file, you could use myorg-nginx or ./myorg-nginx. Linux systems will execute myorg-nginx as if the user used ./myorg-nginx. Windows: To run an executable called myorg-nginx.exe in the same directory as the definition file, you could use \\myorg-nginx.exe or .\\myorg-nginx.exe. Windows systems writing myorg-nginx.exe will be executed as if indicating the current path: .\\myorg-nginx.exe. To use a command installed inside a directory on the host's $PATH, simply use the command name. Example: python. To run any other executable which is neither on the host's $PATH nor within the integration's directory, use an absolute path to the executable. Example: /opt/jdk/bin/java. If the given executable name exists within the integration's directory but also exists elsewhere on the system $PATH, the version in the integration's directory takes precedence. interval Optional. The number of seconds between two consecutive executions of the command, in particular between the end of the previous execution and the start of the next execution. Default for metric polling: 30 seconds. Minimum (floor): 15 seconds. Alerts: For metrics being used for alerts, use an interval of 30 seconds or less. prefix Optional. The categorization of the inventory in the form of category/short_integration_name. Example: integration/myorg-nginx. The prefix is not a platform-specific path. The forward slash is the correct separator between the category and short_integration_name. The prefix can have a maximum of two levels. Otherwise inventory will not be reported. Default value if not set: integration/integration_name. Configuration file The configuration file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml. This file specifies which executables to run and the parameters required to run them. It lives in this directory: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d Copy Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Here's an example of a config file with one instance defined. Explanations of these fields are explained below the example. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Another example of a config file with two instances defined. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://one.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer - name: nginx2.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://another.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Config file field definitions Config file field Description integration_name Required. This is the header and is used to identify which executables to run. This name must exactly match the name specified in the integration's definition file. Recommendation: To ensure unique names, use reverse domain name notation. name Required. This is the name for the specific invocation (instance) of the integration. This is used to help identify any log messages generated by this integration and is also useful for troubleshooting. command Required. This is the command to be executed. This must exactly match one of the unique alias names specified in the integration's definition file. arguments Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The argument name. Transformed to upper case when set as environment variable. Values: The argument values. Passed through as is. The arguments are made available to an integration as a set of environment variables. Arguments in the config file cannot be capitalised and should use underscores to separate words. labels Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The label name. Values: The defined label value. integration_user Optional. String with the name the agent will use for executing the integration binary. Default: depends on the usermode. By default, integrations are executed with the same user that's running the integration agent, nri-agent for privileged and unprivileged mode and root user for root mode. When present, the Infrastructure agent will execute the integration binary as the specified user. For example, to run the integration binary as the root user when running the agent in a usermode different than root, just add integration_user: root to the configuration file.",

The categorization of the inventory in the form of category/short_integration_name. Example: integration/myorg-nginx. The prefix is not a platform-specific path. The forward slash is the correct separator between the category and short_integration_name. The prefix can have a maximum of two levels. Otherwise inventory will not be reported. Default value if not set: integration/integration_name. Configuration file The configuration file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml. This file specifies which executables to run and the parameters required to run them. It lives in this directory: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d Copy Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Here's an example of a config file with one instance defined. Explanations of these fields are explained below the example. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Another example of a config file with two instances defined. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://one.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer - name: nginx2.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://another.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Config file field definitions Config file field Description integration_name Required. This is the header and is used to identify which executables to run. This name must exactly match the name specified in the integration's definition file. Recommendation: To ensure unique names, use reverse domain name notation. name Required. This is the name for the specific invocation (instance) of the integration. This is used to help identify any log messages generated by this integration and is also useful for troubleshooting. command Required. This is the command to be executed. This must exactly match one of the unique alias names specified in the integration's definition file. arguments Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The argument name. Transformed to upper case when set as environment variable. Values: The argument values. Passed through as is. The arguments are made available to an integration as a set of environment variables. Arguments in the config file cannot be capitalised and should use underscores to separate words. labels Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The label name. Values: The defined label value. integration_user Optional. String with the name the agent will use for executing the integration binary. Default: depends on the usermode. By default, integrations are executed with the same user that's running the integration agent, nri-agent for privileged and unprivileged mode and root user for root mode. When present, the Infrastructure agent will execute the integration binary as the specified user. For example, to run the integration binary as the root user when running the agent in a usermode different than root, just add integration_user: root to the configuration file.",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. In December 2019, Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began supporting a newer configuration format that makes use of a single configuration file (instead of two separate files), and provides other improvements. This document will explain how this newer format works. The older standard configuration format is supported by current Infrastructure agents. For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration structure An on-host integration's configuration YAML must have an integrations top-level section containing a YAML array, where each entry represents an integration and its configuration. For each integration entry, only the name property is mandatory. The other properties are optional. Here's an example configuration featuring two integrations: our built-in Docker integration, which requires no configuration, and our MySQL integration: integrations: # New Relic integration that does not require any configuration - name: nri-docker # New Relic integration that gets its configuration from the environment - name: nri-mysql env: PORT: 3306 USERNAME: newrelic PASSWORD: 123456789 # to hide this field, read the secrets management documentation # Any free-form integration executed via a user-provided command - name: my-own-integration exec: python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy You can have as many configuration YAML files as you want and can group your integration instances. Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Each configuration YAML file can also contain discovery and variables top-level sections. Important This configuration format does not require an agent restart. When saved, changes are detected and implemented immediately. This means that saving intermediate configuration changes may cause the integration to stop working. List of configuration properties This is a list of the general properties used to configure an integration. For more details about using these properties, including example values, see the documentation following the table. Config Description name Name of the integration. This is the only mandatory configuration property across all on-host integrations. If the exec field is not set it will also be the name of the integration executable. cli_args Optional list of command line arguments when name is used to provide the integration executable. Available since agent version 1.13.0. exec Full path to the integration executable, plus arguments. It may be a single-line string or a string array. If left unspecified, the exec field defaults to the name field. env YAML map containing the environment variables to be passed to the integration, where key is the environment variable name, and value is the variable value. config Configuration that is written as an external file and the path that is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. config_template_path Any external file whose path is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. Its usage allows applying discovery and secrets binding to any external configuration. integration_user Name of the user who runs the integration. interval Time between consecutive executions of the integration. It must be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h), without spaces. inventory_source Allows overriding the category and term of the inventory source. labels Map with labels that decorate the data (metrics, events, inventory) reported by the integration. timeout A number followed by a time unit (ms, s, m or h). An integration that hasn't responded in this time period is killed and restarted. working_dir Working directory for the integration binary. when Integration is only executed if the clause evaluates to true. Conditions are defined below. The remainder of this document describes config properties grouped by their functionality: Select an integration to run Pass configuration to the integration command Configure how the agent executes integrations Select an integration to run There are two properties to select which integration will run: name and exec. The only mandatory property across all on-host integrations is name. The remaining properties specified in this document are optional. Example: integrations: - name: nri-docker - name: my-integration exec: /usr/local/bin/my-integration --metrics --inventory Copy name The mandatory name property can work in two ways: If the exec property is set: The name property only provides an identifier for the integration instance. This identifier is used in log messages and to provide a default inventory category/source in the form integration/<name> (for example, integration/nri-redis). This inventory path can be overridden with the inventory_source configuration option. If the exec property is not set: The agent looks for (and executes) an executable with the name value in any of the following folders: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations Windows C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\bin C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations If there is no executable with this name in the above folders the agent logs an error and the integration is not executed. Important In Windows, do not append the .exe extension to the name. The agent does this for you (for example, name: nri-mysql would look for nri-mysql.exe in the above folders). exec The exec optional property specifies the path, command, and command-line arguments of the integration to execute. When none of the path folders or arguments have spaces, it can be written in a single-line string: - name: my-integration exec: /usr/bin/python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy If any of the path/arguments have spaces that are part of a single element, you can use a YAML array notation: - name: my-integration exec: - C:\\Program Files\\My Integration\\integration.exe - --host - 127.0.0.1 - --port - 8080 Copy The default working directory is the root directory of the agent configuration. It can be overridden with the working_dir property. cli_args The cli_args optional property specifies command line arguments that should be passed to the integration. It is useful when using name as it only provides the integration name identifier (not compatible with exec). - name: my-integration cli_args: [ -interval 10s ] Copy Usual YAML multi-line list format can be used as well: - name: my-integration cli_args: - -interval - 10s Copy when The when property allows to execute the integration only when all the evaluated conditions are successful. Available conditions are: env_exists: Environment variables exist and match value. file_exists: Given file path exists. feature: Provided feature-flag is enabled. Example: integrations: - name: ssh-integration when: file_exists: /var/run/sshd.pid Copy Pass configuration to the integration executable Often integration executables need to receive a configuration to work properly (for example, hostname and port of the monitored system, user credentials, etc.). The Infrastructure agent allows you to configure the integration commands in three ways (which you can combine): Command-line arguments, passed in the exec property. Environment variables, using the env property. Configuration files, whose path needs to be passed through environment variables or command-line arguments (see the config) property. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/path/bin/script --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8081 - name: nri-mysql env: STATUS_URL: http://10.0.0.3/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true Copy env The env property allows you to set environment variables that are passed to the executable. It is a key-value map with the required variables. Example: integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: DATABASE: postgres PORT: 6432 COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false VERBOSE: 1 Copy If you expect your integration to receive the configuration from the host's environment rather than specifying it explicitly in the configuration file, you need to set the required variables in the Infrastructure agent passthrough_environment global configuration property config This section describes various ways to pass configuration information to an integration. Pass configuration file directly Some integration commands may get their configuration from an external file. If your integration requires a configuration file, nothing prevents you from directly passing its path directly as a command-line argument or an environment variable. Here's an example using configuration of our Flex integration: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: /etc/nri-flex/configs/http-service.yaml - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f /opt/integration/config.properties Copy The above example assumes that the http-service.yaml and config.properties files exist. We can see that the nri-flex integration is expecting the http-service.yaml complete path via the CONFIG_FILE environment variable and the other-integration expects the complete config.properties path after the -f command-line flag. In the above example, it's necessary for the integration installer/configurator that the configuration files exist in the provided path and that the agent and integrations have read permissions on them. Pass configuration through config section If you prefer to keep your configuration file with the rest of the integration configuration, you can use the config section in the integration entry, which can contain a valid YAML object or just a multi-line string: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f ${config.path} config: | example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostname=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy In the above examples, every time the nri-flex integration is executed, the agent creates a temporary file with the following contents: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy The above YAML is only a configuration example for the nri-flex integration. The agent ignores its contents; instead, it creates a temporary file and replaces the ${config.path} variable placeholder with its path. When the integration completes execution the temporary file is removed. Also, the agent creates another temporary file before executing the other-integration integration: example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostid=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy It replaces the -f ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary path of the written file. By convention, if you do not place the ${config.path} variable in any command-line argument or environment variable value, the agent passes the path of the configuration file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable: # assuming that nri-example command is prepared to receive the configuration # file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable integrations: - name: nri-example config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy Pass secrets and discovery through config section The main benefit for using a config section instead of hardcoding the full path of an external file is that you can insert ${variable} placeholders to apply our auto-discovery feature and secrets management. Here's an example followed by some explanations: variables: my_credentials: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token discovery: docker: match: label.service: foo integrations: - name: foo-monitor exec: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=${config.path} config: | foo.host=${discovery.ip} foo.port=${discovery.port} foo.user=${my_credentials.user} foo.password=${my_credentials.password} Copy Tip (For more details about the variables and discovery sections, please visit the discovery and secrets management documentation). The above example relies on the following premises: There is a Vault service that allows retrieving a JSON object formed by the user and password fields. There may be a variable number of Docker containers labeled with service=foo, which are accessible from the agent host via a discoverable public IP and Port. The user has configured the foo-monitor integration to monitor all the service=foo labeled containers, which share a common user and password. Each instance of the foo-monitor integration requires executing the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable, passing the text configuration inside the config section via the --config=<path> command-line argument. As example of workflow, imagine that the Vault invocation returns the following JSON: {\"user\":\"monitorer\",\"password\":\"5up3r53cr3t!\"} Copy At the moment of executing the foo-monitor integration, there are three running containers labeled with service=foo: ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8080 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8081 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8082 The agent then creates the following three temporary files, using the contents of the config property as a template, but replacing the ${placeholders} by the acquired variables and discovered items (files' path is invented for the sake of simplicity): First match (/tmp/123_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8080 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Second match (/tmp/456_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8081 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Third match (/tmp/789_discovered) foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8082 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy After the config variable placeholders have been replaced and the temporary files have been created, the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable is executed three times (one per matched container), replacing the ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary file corresponding to each discovered configuration: First match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/123_discovered Second match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/456_discovered Third match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/789_discovered To ensure security and to minimize the chance of leaking secrets to disk, the agent: Creates the files owned by the agent user, for example, root or nri-agent, depending on the user you have configured to run the agent. Sets read permissions only for the owner. Removes the created files when the integration instance finishes its execution. config_template_path If you want to use the secrets management and discovery in the configuration files that you're passing to the integration executable, but you prefer to keep them as an individual file, you can use the config_template_path: <path> option. It works exactly as in the config section: The agent applies secrets management and discovery to the file contents. The agent creates different temporary files that are passed to the integration via the ${config.path} placeholder (or the CONFIG_PATH environment variable). Example: discovery: docker: match: name: /^redis/ integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config_template_path: /etc/flex-configs/redis.yml Copy In the above example, the redis.yml external file can contain container discovery variable placeholders, like ${discovery.ip} or ${discovery.port}. Configure how the agent executes your integrations The properties of this section modify the way the Infrastructure agent executes and interacts with the integrations, or the way the agent decorates the integrations' data. integration_user The integration commands run as the same user as the agent (usually root or nri-agent). If due to permission restrictions an integration needs to run as another user, its name must be specified in the integration_user property. Example: integrations: - name: dbus-inventory exec: python my-dbus-script.py integration_user: dbus Copy interval The interval option sets the time between consecutive executions of an integration. The accepted format is an integer immediately followed by a time unit (s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). The default is 30s, and the minimum accepted value is 15s. Any value lower than 15s is automatically set to 15s. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover interval: 20s Copy inventory_source Any inventory item must be catalogued under a category/source taxonomy. By default, each integration inventory is stored as integration/ + name value (for example, integration/nri-apache, integration/nri-mysql). The inventory_source property allows you to override the default taxonomy of inventory data. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx - name: nri-apache exec: - /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/nri-apache - --inventory inventory_source: config/apache Copy In the above example, the nri-nginx inventory, if any, would be visible in the New Relic UI under the integration/nri-nginx source. The nri-apache inventory would be visible under config/apache. labels labels is a key-value map that allows extra metadata to be provided for the integration. The agent uses those labels to decorate the metrics, events, and inventory that it receives from a given integration instance. Example: integrations: - name: nri-apache inventory_source: config/apache labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy In the above example, the agent decorates all the metrics and events from the nri-apache instance with the following fields: label.env: production label.role: load_balancer Also, the following entries are added to the integration inventory: config/apache/labels/env: production config/apache/labels/role: load_balancer timeout If an integration has not returned any metric (or a heartbeat message as described below) before the time specified in the timeout value, the agent kills the integration process and restarts it after the corresponding interval. The accepted format is an integer number immediately followed (without spaces) by a time unit (ms for milliseconds, s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). If a zero (or negative) timeout value is provided, the integration can run forever without being killed by a timeout expiration. For long-running integrations (integrations that keep running, periodically returning metrics/events/inventory), each time the integration submits a metrics/events/inventory payload, the timeout deadline is restarted. That means that long-running integrations must return a valid JSON payload in an interval that is lower than timeout. Returning an empty JSON ({}) is interpreted as a heart-beat message that restarts the timeout, preventing the long-running integration from being killed, even if they don't have information to report. The default is 120s, and the minimum accepted value is 100ms. Any value lower than 100ms is automatically set to 100ms. Example: integrations: - name: nri-jmx arguments: JMX_HOST: jmx-host.localnet JMX_PORT: 7096 COLLECTION_FILES: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml\" timeout: 30s Copy working_dir working_dir sets the working directory of the command. If empty or unspecified, the agent runs the command in the Infrastructure agent's current directory. The default is the Infrastructure agent root directory. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/integration/bin/integration working_dir: /opt/integration/scratch-zone Copy Update older integration configuration In December 2019, the Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began using a different configuration format. For details, see Config format differences. The main difference between these formats is that the older configuration format uses two separate configuration files (a INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml file and a INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml file) and the newer version uses a single configuration file. Here are some of the features added by the newer configuration functionality: Flexible configuration via command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files. Ability to group different integrations in the same file. Hot reload: adding a new integration or changing its configuration does not require restarting the agent. Timeouts: if an integration doesn't respond before a user-specified time, the integration process is killed and restarted. Not all on-host integrations come with the newer configuration format, but you can update the configuration to the new format for all on-host integrations to take advantage of the new features. The following YAML shows an example Apache integration configuration using the older configuration format. Note that this configuration will still work with newer agents, but we recommend updating your integrations to take full advantage of features. integration_name: com.newrelic.apache instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy To update an older integration configuration to the new format, you must perform two steps: Rename the instances top-level section to integrations. Remove the integration_name top-level section and add it to each integration entry. You are no longer required to keep a separate file for each integration type and you can group your legacy integration entries in the same file as other integrations. The new version of the Apache integration config: integrations: - name: apache-server-metrics integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Please note that because the older configuration format doesn't support hot reloading. You will need to restart the Infrastructure agent to remove the old integrations configuration (otherwise the old instances will coexist with the new ones).",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. In December 2019, Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began supporting a newer configuration format that makes use of a single configuration file (instead of two separate files), and provides other improvements. This document will explain how this newer format works. The older standard configuration format is supported by current Infrastructure agents. For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration structure An on-host integration's configuration YAML must have an integrations top-level section containing a YAML array, where each entry represents an integration and its configuration. For each integration entry, only the name property is mandatory. The other properties are optional. Here's an example configuration featuring two integrations: our built-in Docker integration, which requires no configuration, and our MySQL integration: integrations: # New Relic integration that does not require any configuration - name: nri-docker # New Relic integration that gets its configuration from the environment - name: nri-mysql env: PORT: 3306 USERNAME: newrelic PASSWORD: 123456789 # to hide this field, read the secrets management documentation # Any free-form integration executed via a user-provided command - name: my-own-integration exec: python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy You can have as many configuration YAML files as you want and can group your integration instances. Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Each configuration YAML file can also contain discovery and variables top-level sections. Important This configuration format does not require an agent restart. When saved, changes are detected and implemented immediately. This means that saving intermediate configuration changes may cause the integration to stop working. List of configuration properties This is a list of the general properties used to configure an integration. For more details about using these properties, including example values, see the documentation following the table. Config Description name Name of the integration. This is the only mandatory configuration property across all on-host integrations. If the exec field is not set it will also be the name of the integration executable. cli_args Optional list of command line arguments when name is used to provide the integration executable. Available since agent version 1.13.0. exec Full path to the integration executable, plus arguments. It may be a single-line string or a string array. If left unspecified, the exec field defaults to the name field. env YAML map containing the environment variables to be passed to the integration, where key is the environment variable name, and value is the variable value. config Configuration that is written as an external file and the path that is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. config_template_path Any external file whose path is passed to the integration with the CONFIG_PATH environment variable or the ${config.path} variable placeholder. Its usage allows applying discovery and secrets binding to any external configuration. integration_user Name of the user who runs the integration. interval Time between consecutive executions of the integration. It must be a number followed by a time unit (s, m or h), without spaces. inventory_source Allows overriding the category and term of the inventory source. labels Map with labels that decorate the data (metrics, events, inventory) reported by the integration. timeout A number followed by a time unit (ms, s, m or h). An integration that hasn't responded in this time period is killed and restarted. working_dir Working directory for the integration binary. when Integration is only executed if the clause evaluates to true. Conditions are defined below. The remainder of this document describes config properties grouped by their functionality: Select an integration to run Pass configuration to the integration command Configure how the agent executes integrations Select an integration to run There are two properties to select which integration will run: name and exec. The only mandatory property across all on-host integrations is name. The remaining properties specified in this document are optional. Example: integrations: - name: nri-docker - name: my-integration exec: /usr/local/bin/my-integration --metrics --inventory Copy name The mandatory name property can work in two ways: If the exec property is set: The name property only provides an identifier for the integration instance. This identifier is used in log messages and to provide a default inventory category/source in the form integration/<name> (for example, integration/nri-redis). This inventory path can be overridden with the inventory_source configuration option. If the exec property is not set: The agent looks for (and executes) an executable with the name value in any of the following folders: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations/bin /var/db/newrelic-infra/custom-integrations Windows C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations\\bin C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations If there is no executable with this name in the above folders the agent logs an error and the integration is not executed. Important In Windows, do not append the .exe extension to the name. The agent does this for you (for example, name: nri-mysql would look for nri-mysql.exe in the above folders). exec The exec optional property specifies the path, command, and command-line arguments of the integration to execute. When none of the path folders or arguments have spaces, it can be written in a single-line string: - name: my-integration exec: /usr/bin/python /opt/integrations/my-script.py --host=127.0.0.1 Copy If any of the path/arguments have spaces that are part of a single element, you can use a YAML array notation: - name: my-integration exec: - C:\\Program Files\\My Integration\\integration.exe - --host - 127.0.0.1 - --port - 8080 Copy The default working directory is the root directory of the agent configuration. It can be overridden with the working_dir property. cli_args The cli_args optional property specifies command line arguments that should be passed to the integration. It is useful when using name as it only provides the integration name identifier (not compatible with exec). - name: my-integration cli_args: [ -interval 10s ] Copy Usual YAML multi-line list format can be used as well: - name: my-integration cli_args: - -interval - 10s Copy when The when property allows to execute the integration only when all the evaluated conditions are successful. Available conditions are: env_exists: Environment variables exist and match value. file_exists: Given file path exists. feature: Provided feature-flag is enabled. Example: integrations: - name: ssh-integration when: file_exists: /var/run/sshd.pid Copy Pass configuration to the integration executable Often integration executables need to receive a configuration to work properly (for example, hostname and port of the monitored system, user credentials, etc.). The Infrastructure agent allows you to configure the integration commands in three ways (which you can combine): Command-line arguments, passed in the exec property. Environment variables, using the env property. Configuration files, whose path needs to be passed through environment variables or command-line arguments (see the config) property. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/path/bin/script --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8081 - name: nri-mysql env: STATUS_URL: http://10.0.0.3/server-status?auto REMOTE_MONITORING: true Copy env The env property allows you to set environment variables that are passed to the executable. It is a key-value map with the required variables. Example: integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: DATABASE: postgres PORT: 6432 COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false VERBOSE: 1 Copy If you expect your integration to receive the configuration from the host's environment rather than specifying it explicitly in the configuration file, you need to set the required variables in the Infrastructure agent passthrough_environment global configuration property config This section describes various ways to pass configuration information to an integration. Pass configuration file directly Some integration commands may get their configuration from an external file. If your integration requires a configuration file, nothing prevents you from directly passing its path directly as a command-line argument or an environment variable. Here's an example using configuration of our Flex integration: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: /etc/nri-flex/configs/http-service.yaml - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f /opt/integration/config.properties Copy The above example assumes that the http-service.yaml and config.properties files exist. We can see that the nri-flex integration is expecting the http-service.yaml complete path via the CONFIG_FILE environment variable and the other-integration expects the complete config.properties path after the -f command-line flag. In the above example, it's necessary for the integration installer/configurator that the configuration files exist in the provided path and that the agent and integrations have read permissions on them. Pass configuration through config section If you prefer to keep your configuration file with the rest of the integration configuration, you can use the config section in the integration entry, which can contain a valid YAML object or just a multi-line string: integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv - name: other-integration exec: /opt/integration/integration -f ${config.path} config: | example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostname=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy In the above examples, every time the nri-flex integration is executed, the agent creates a temporary file with the following contents: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy The above YAML is only a configuration example for the nri-flex integration. The agent ignores its contents; instead, it creates a temporary file and replaces the ${config.path} variable placeholder with its path. When the integration completes execution the temporary file is removed. Also, the agent creates another temporary file before executing the other-integration integration: example.cfg.verbose=true example.cfg.logger=/var/logs/integration.log example.cfg.hostid=localhost example.cfg.port=9025 Copy It replaces the -f ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary path of the written file. By convention, if you do not place the ${config.path} variable in any command-line argument or environment variable value, the agent passes the path of the configuration file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable: # assuming that nri-example command is prepared to receive the configuration # file via the CONFIG_PATH environment variable integrations: - name: nri-example config: name: csvFileExample apis: - name: csvFile file: /Users/hello/test.csv Copy Pass secrets and discovery through config section The main benefit for using a config section instead of hardcoding the full path of an external file is that you can insert ${variable} placeholders to apply our auto-discovery feature and secrets management. Here's an example followed by some explanations: variables: my_credentials: vault: http: url: http://my.vault.host/v1/newengine/data/secret headers: X-Vault-Token: my-vault-token discovery: docker: match: label.service: foo integrations: - name: foo-monitor exec: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=${config.path} config: | foo.host=${discovery.ip} foo.port=${discovery.port} foo.user=${my_credentials.user} foo.password=${my_credentials.password} Copy Tip (For more details about the variables and discovery sections, please visit the discovery and secrets management documentation). The above example relies on the following premises: There is a Vault service that allows retrieving a JSON object formed by the user and password fields. There may be a variable number of Docker containers labeled with service=foo, which are accessible from the agent host via a discoverable public IP and Port. The user has configured the foo-monitor integration to monitor all the service=foo labeled containers, which share a common user and password. Each instance of the foo-monitor integration requires executing the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable, passing the text configuration inside the config section via the --config=<path> command-line argument. As example of workflow, imagine that the Vault invocation returns the following JSON: {\"user\":\"monitorer\",\"password\":\"5up3r53cr3t!\"} Copy At the moment of executing the foo-monitor integration, there are three running containers labeled with service=foo: ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8080 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8081 ip: 10.0.0.3, port: 8082 The agent then creates the following three temporary files, using the contents of the config property as a template, but replacing the ${placeholders} by the acquired variables and discovered items (files' path is invented for the sake of simplicity): First match (/tmp/123_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8080 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Second match (/tmp/456_discovered): foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8081 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy Third match (/tmp/789_discovered) foo.host=10.0.0.3 foo.port=8082 foo.user=monitorer foo.password=5up3r53cr3t! Copy After the config variable placeholders have been replaced and the temporary files have been created, the /opt/foo/bin/monitor executable is executed three times (one per matched container), replacing the ${config.path} command-line placeholder with the temporary file corresponding to each discovered configuration: First match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/123_discovered Second match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/456_discovered Third match: /opt/foo/bin/monitor --config=/tmp/789_discovered To ensure security and to minimize the chance of leaking secrets to disk, the agent: Creates the files owned by the agent user, for example, root or nri-agent, depending on the user you have configured to run the agent. Sets read permissions only for the owner. Removes the created files when the integration instance finishes its execution. config_template_path If you want to use the secrets management and discovery in the configuration files that you're passing to the integration executable, but you prefer to keep them as an individual file, you can use the config_template_path: <path> option. It works exactly as in the config section: The agent applies secrets management and discovery to the file contents. The agent creates different temporary files that are passed to the integration via the ${config.path} placeholder (or the CONFIG_PATH environment variable). Example: discovery: docker: match: name: /^redis/ integrations: - name: nri-flex env: CONFIG_FILE: ${config.path} config_template_path: /etc/flex-configs/redis.yml Copy In the above example, the redis.yml external file can contain container discovery variable placeholders, like ${discovery.ip} or ${discovery.port}. Configure how the agent executes your integrations The properties of this section modify the way the Infrastructure agent executes and interacts with the integrations, or the way the agent decorates the integrations' data. integration_user The integration commands run as the same user as the agent (usually root or nri-agent). If due to permission restrictions an integration needs to run as another user, its name must be specified in the integration_user property. Example: integrations: - name: dbus-inventory exec: python my-dbus-script.py integration_user: dbus Copy interval The interval option sets the time between consecutive executions of an integration. The accepted format is an integer immediately followed by a time unit (s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). The default is 30s, and the minimum accepted value is 15s. Any value lower than 15s is automatically set to 15s. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover interval: 20s Copy inventory_source Any inventory item must be catalogued under a category/source taxonomy. By default, each integration inventory is stored as integration/ + name value (for example, integration/nri-apache, integration/nri-mysql). The inventory_source property allows you to override the default taxonomy of inventory data. Example: integrations: - name: nri-nginx - name: nri-apache exec: - /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations/bin/nri-apache - --inventory inventory_source: config/apache Copy In the above example, the nri-nginx inventory, if any, would be visible in the New Relic UI under the integration/nri-nginx source. The nri-apache inventory would be visible under config/apache. labels labels is a key-value map that allows extra metadata to be provided for the integration. The agent uses those labels to decorate the metrics, events, and inventory that it receives from a given integration instance. Example: integrations: - name: nri-apache inventory_source: config/apache labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy In the above example, the agent decorates all the metrics and events from the nri-apache instance with the following fields: label.env: production label.role: load_balancer Also, the following entries are added to the integration inventory: config/apache/labels/env: production config/apache/labels/role: load_balancer timeout If an integration has not returned any metric (or a heartbeat message as described below) before the time specified in the timeout value, the agent kills the integration process and restarts it after the corresponding interval. The accepted format is an integer number immediately followed (without spaces) by a time unit (ms for milliseconds, s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours). If a zero (or negative) timeout value is provided, the integration can run forever without being killed by a timeout expiration. For long-running integrations (integrations that keep running, periodically returning metrics/events/inventory), each time the integration submits a metrics/events/inventory payload, the timeout deadline is restarted. That means that long-running integrations must return a valid JSON payload in an interval that is lower than timeout. Returning an empty JSON ({}) is interpreted as a heart-beat message that restarts the timeout, preventing the long-running integration from being killed, even if they don't have information to report. The default is 120s, and the minimum accepted value is 100ms. Any value lower than 100ms is automatically set to 100ms. Example: integrations: - name: nri-jmx arguments: JMX_HOST: jmx-host.localnet JMX_PORT: 7096 COLLECTION_FILES: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml\" timeout: 30s Copy working_dir working_dir sets the working directory of the command. If empty or unspecified, the agent runs the command in the Infrastructure agent's current directory. The default is the Infrastructure agent root directory. Example: integrations: - name: my-integration exec: /opt/integration/bin/integration working_dir: /opt/integration/scratch-zone Copy Update older integration configuration In December 2019, the Infrastructure agent version 1.8.0 began using a different configuration format. For details, see Config format differences. The main difference between these formats is that the older configuration format uses two separate configuration files (a INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml file and a INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml file) and the newer version uses a single configuration file. Here are some of the features added by the newer configuration functionality: Flexible configuration via command-line arguments, environment variables, or external files. Ability to group different integrations in the same file. Hot reload: adding a new integration or changing its configuration does not require restarting the agent. Timeouts: if an integration doesn't respond before a user-specified time, the integration process is killed and restarted. Not all on-host integrations come with the newer configuration format, but you can update the configuration to the new format for all on-host integrations to take advantage of the new features. The following YAML shows an example Apache integration configuration using the older configuration format. Note that this configuration will still work with newer agents, but we recommend updating your integrations to take full advantage of features. integration_name: com.newrelic.apache instances: - name: apache-server-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy To update an older integration configuration to the new format, you must perform two steps: Rename the instances top-level section to integrations. Remove the integration_name top-level section and add it to each integration entry. You are no longer required to keep a separate file for each integration type and you can group your legacy integration entries in the same file as other integrations. The new version of the Apache integration config: integrations: - name: apache-server-metrics integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: apache-server-inventory integration_name: com.newrelic.apache command: inventory arguments: remote_monitoring: true labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Please note that because the older configuration format doesn't support hot reloading. You will need to restart the Infrastructure agent to remove the old integrations configuration (otherwise the old instances will coexist with the new ones).",

      "body": "Problem You created a custom New Relic Infrastructure on-host integration using the Integrations SDK, but you're not seeing data in the Infrastructure UI. Solution To troubleshoot and resolve the problem: Verify that your integration meets New Relic Infrastructure's integration requirements. After ruling out common problems with integration requirements, follow the more in-depth troubleshooting procedures for error logs and integration loading. Troubleshoot integration requirements If you are not receiving data from your custom integration, verify that your integration follows these requirements. Integration requirements Comments Environment Make sure your environment meets the Integrations SDK requirements. Configuration file Use a validator such as yamllint to verify that the configuration file is a valid YAML file. Verify that the file is in the correct location. Definition file Use a validator such as yamllint to verify that the definition file is a valid YAML file. Verify that the header fields have the required format. Verify that the prefix for inventory set in the definition file is no more than two levels deep. Verify that the file is in the correct location. Metric sets Verify that the integration: Does not generate metric sets with more than 120 key-value pairs. Does not generate more than 1000 metric sets. JSON payload Verify that the integration does not generate a single JSON payload of more than 5 MB. Check the integration log file for error messages After ruling out common problems with integration requirements, follow these more in-depth troubleshooting procedures. Recommendation: Configure a log file in the Infrastructure agent configuration. This helps separate the types of errors so you can spot integration errors more easily. When there is an error loading or running your integration, the Infrastructure agent adds an error message to the log file. Errors are logged even if verbose mode is disabled. Check the log file for lines that include \"level=error\". If there are no error messages, check whether the Infrastructure agent is loading the integration correctly. Check that the integration is loading correctly To verify whether the Infrastructure agent is loading the integration correctly: Enable verbose mode in the Infrastructure agent configuration. Restart the Infrastructure agent. Verify that the first lines of the log file contain two messages: \"loaded plugin\" plugin=<your_integration_name> \"found plugin config file\" plugin-path=\"<your_integration_config_path>\" Copy Check for errors just before or after these lines that indicate a problem with loading. The agent schedules data to be sent based on the schedule set in the definition file. Look in the log file for the integration's JSON.

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. This document explains the older, standard configuration format. This format is used by most on-host integrations and is supported by newer Infrastructure agents (which also support a newer, improved configuration format). For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration file structure An on-host integration that uses the standard configuration format requires two configuration files: A definition file A configuration file Definition file The definition file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml. This file provides descriptive information about the integration, such as: the version of the JSON protocol it supports, a list of commands it can execute, and arguments that it accepts. It lives in this directory: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations Copy Here's an example of an NGINX integration definition file with two command sections on a Linux system: name: com.myorg.nginx protocol_version: 2 description: Collect metric and configuration data from NGINX os: linux commands: metrics: command: - myorg-nginx - --metrics interval: 15 inventory: command: - myorg-nginx - --inventory interval: 120 prefix: integration/myorg-nginx Copy A definition file can be broken down into two parts: The header The commands section Definition file header Here are explanations of a definition file's header elements: Definition header field Description name Required. A unique name name to identify the integration for logging, internal metrics, etc. When the agent loads the config file, New Relic uses the name to look up the integration in the agent's registry. protocol_version Required. The version number of the protocol. New Relic uses this to ensure compatibility between the integration and the agent. If the agent does not recognize an integration's version, it will filter out that integration and create a log message. The current version of the JSON protocol is 2. For more on protocol changes, see SDK changes. description Optional. Human-friendly explanation of what the integration does. os Optional. The operating system where the integration runs. New Relic uses this to filter integrations that you intend to run only on specific operating systems. Default: Run the integration regardless of the os value. To restrict the integration to a specific operating system, use either of these options: linux windows Definition file commands After the header is a list of commands. The commands section defines: One or more independent operating modes for the executable The runtime data required for it to be executed The commands section is a YAML map of command definitions, where each key is the unique alias name of the command in the integration's config file that specifies the executable to run. Definition commands Description command Required. The actual command line to be executed as a YAML array of command parts. These are assembled to run the actual command. For simple commands, the array might be only a single element. Additional command rules include: command arguments: The command and any command line arguments that are shared for all instances of the integration configuration. command execution: The command will be executed in the same directory as the definition file. command path: Any commands available on the host's $PATH can be used. Executables located in the same directory as the definition file, or in a subdirectory of it, can be executed using a relative path. For example: Linux: To run an executable called myorg-nginx in the same directory as the definition file, you could use myorg-nginx or ./myorg-nginx. Linux systems will execute myorg-nginx as if the user used ./myorg-nginx. Windows: To run an executable called myorg-nginx.exe in the same directory as the definition file, you could use \\myorg-nginx.exe or .\\myorg-nginx.exe. Windows systems writing myorg-nginx.exe will be executed as if indicating the current path: .\\myorg-nginx.exe. To use a command installed inside a directory on the host's $PATH, simply use the command name. Example: python. To run any other executable which is neither on the host's $PATH nor within the integration's directory, use an absolute path to the executable. Example: /opt/jdk/bin/java. If the given executable name exists within the integration's directory but also exists elsewhere on the system $PATH, the version in the integration's directory takes precedence. interval Optional. The number of seconds between two consecutive executions of the command, in particular between the end of the previous execution and the start of the next execution. Default for metric polling: 30 seconds. Minimum (floor): 15 seconds. Alerts: For metrics being used for alerts, use an interval of 30 seconds or less. prefix Optional. The categorization of the inventory in the form of category/short_integration_name. Example: integration/myorg-nginx. The prefix is not a platform-specific path. The forward slash is the correct separator between the category and short_integration_name. The prefix can have a maximum of two levels. Otherwise inventory will not be reported. Default value if not set: integration/integration_name. Configuration file The configuration file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml. This file specifies which executables to run and the parameters required to run them. It lives in this directory: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d Copy Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Here's an example of a config file with one instance defined. Explanations of these fields are explained below the example. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Another example of a config file with two instances defined. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://one.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer - name: nginx2.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://another.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Config file field definitions Config file field Description integration_name Required. This is the header and is used to identify which executables to run. This name must exactly match the name specified in the integration's definition file. Recommendation: To ensure unique names, use reverse domain name notation. name Required. This is the name for the specific invocation (instance) of the integration. This is used to help identify any log messages generated by this integration and is also useful for troubleshooting. command Required. This is the command to be executed. This must exactly match one of the unique alias names specified in the integration's definition file. arguments Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The argument name. Transformed to upper case when set as environment variable. Values: The argument values. Passed through as is. The arguments are made available to an integration as a set of environment variables. Arguments in the config file cannot be capitalised and should use underscores to separate words. labels Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The label name. Values: The defined label value. integration_user Optional. String with the name the agent will use for executing the integration binary. Default: depends on the usermode. By default, integrations are executed with the same user that's running the integration agent, nri-agent for privileged and unprivileged mode and root user for root mode. When present, the Infrastructure agent will execute the integration binary as the specified user. For example, to run the integration binary as the root user when running the agent in a usermode different than root, just add integration_user: root to the configuration file.",

      "body": "New Relic Infrastructure on-host integrations can use one of two types of configuration formats. This document explains the older, standard configuration format. This format is used by most on-host integrations and is supported by newer Infrastructure agents (which also support a newer, improved configuration format). For an introduction to configuration, see Config overview. Configuration file structure An on-host integration that uses the standard configuration format requires two configuration files: A definition file A configuration file Definition file The definition file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-definition.yml. This file provides descriptive information about the integration, such as: the version of the JSON protocol it supports, a list of commands it can execute, and arguments that it accepts. It lives in this directory: Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-integrations Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-integrations Copy Here's an example of an NGINX integration definition file with two command sections on a Linux system: name: com.myorg.nginx protocol_version: 2 description: Collect metric and configuration data from NGINX os: linux commands: metrics: command: - myorg-nginx - --metrics interval: 15 inventory: command: - myorg-nginx - --inventory interval: 120 prefix: integration/myorg-nginx Copy A definition file can be broken down into two parts: The header The commands section Definition file header Here are explanations of a definition file's header elements: Definition header field Description name Required. A unique name name to identify the integration for logging, internal metrics, etc. When the agent loads the config file, New Relic uses the name to look up the integration in the agent's registry. protocol_version Required. The version number of the protocol. New Relic uses this to ensure compatibility between the integration and the agent. If the agent does not recognize an integration's version, it will filter out that integration and create a log message. The current version of the JSON protocol is 2. For more on protocol changes, see SDK changes. description Optional. Human-friendly explanation of what the integration does. os Optional. The operating system where the integration runs. New Relic uses this to filter integrations that you intend to run only on specific operating systems. Default: Run the integration regardless of the os value. To restrict the integration to a specific operating system, use either of these options: linux windows Definition file commands After the header is a list of commands. The commands section defines: One or more independent operating modes for the executable The runtime data required for it to be executed The commands section is a YAML map of command definitions, where each key is the unique alias name of the command in the integration's config file that specifies the executable to run. Definition commands Description command Required. The actual command line to be executed as a YAML array of command parts. These are assembled to run the actual command. For simple commands, the array might be only a single element. Additional command rules include: command arguments: The command and any command line arguments that are shared for all instances of the integration configuration. command execution: The command will be executed in the same directory as the definition file. command path: Any commands available on the host's $PATH can be used. Executables located in the same directory as the definition file, or in a subdirectory of it, can be executed using a relative path. For example: Linux: To run an executable called myorg-nginx in the same directory as the definition file, you could use myorg-nginx or ./myorg-nginx. Linux systems will execute myorg-nginx as if the user used ./myorg-nginx. Windows: To run an executable called myorg-nginx.exe in the same directory as the definition file, you could use \\myorg-nginx.exe or .\\myorg-nginx.exe. Windows systems writing myorg-nginx.exe will be executed as if indicating the current path: .\\myorg-nginx.exe. To use a command installed inside a directory on the host's $PATH, simply use the command name. Example: python. To run any other executable which is neither on the host's $PATH nor within the integration's directory, use an absolute path to the executable. Example: /opt/jdk/bin/java. If the given executable name exists within the integration's directory but also exists elsewhere on the system $PATH, the version in the integration's directory takes precedence. interval Optional. The number of seconds between two consecutive executions of the command, in particular between the end of the previous execution and the start of the next execution. Default for metric polling: 30 seconds. Minimum (floor): 15 seconds. Alerts: For metrics being used for alerts, use an interval of 30 seconds or less. prefix Optional. The categorization of the inventory in the form of category/short_integration_name. Example: integration/myorg-nginx. The prefix is not a platform-specific path. The forward slash is the correct separator between the category and short_integration_name. The prefix can have a maximum of two levels. Otherwise inventory will not be reported. Default value if not set: integration/integration_name. Configuration file The configuration file has a naming format like INTEGRATION_NAME-config.yml. This file specifies which executables to run and the parameters required to run them. It lives in this directory: Linux: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Copy Windows: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d Copy Tip We recommend linting the YAML configuration files before using them to avoid formatting issues. Here's an example of a config file with one instance defined. Explanations of these fields are explained below the example. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://127.0.0.1/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Another example of a config file with two instances defined. integration_name: com.myorg.nginx instances: - name: nginx1.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://one.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer - name: nginx2.myorg.com-metrics command: metrics arguments: status_url: http://another.url/status labels: environment: production role: load_balancer Copy Config file field definitions Config file field Description integration_name Required. This is the header and is used to identify which executables to run. This name must exactly match the name specified in the integration's definition file. Recommendation: To ensure unique names, use reverse domain name notation. name Required. This is the name for the specific invocation (instance) of the integration. This is used to help identify any log messages generated by this integration and is also useful for troubleshooting. command Required. This is the command to be executed. This must exactly match one of the unique alias names specified in the integration's definition file. arguments Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The argument name. Transformed to upper case when set as environment variable. Values: The argument values. Passed through as is. The arguments are made available to an integration as a set of environment variables. Arguments in the config file cannot be capitalised and should use underscores to separate words. labels Optional. A YAML object where: Keys: The label name. Values: The defined label value. integration_user Optional. String with the name the agent will use for executing the integration binary. Default: depends on the usermode. By default, integrations are executed with the same user that's running the integration agent, nri-agent for privileged and unprivileged mode and root user for root mode. When present, the Infrastructure agent will execute the integration binary as the specified user. For example, to run the integration binary as the root user when running the agent in a usermode different than root, just add integration_user: root to the configuration file.",

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in mobile, browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

      "body": "Problem You have enabled distributed tracing but data you expected to see does not appear in New Relic's distributed tracing UI. Solution Important Before performing troubleshooting, we recommend reading How distributed tracing works. Here are some causes and solutions when you have problems finding expected data in the distributed tracing UI: Problems with enabling or instrumenting Missing spans due to service not having distributed tracing enabled In order for distributed tracing to report details for all nodes in a trace, each application must be monitored by a New Relic agent that has had distributed tracing enabled. If an application's New Relic account has not had distributed tracing enabled, it will have these issues: Its distributed tracing UI page won't have data. It won't report data to other accounts' distributed traces. Missing apps/services may require manual instrumentation When you enable distributed tracing for applications and services that New Relic automatically instruments, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some services or applications are missing from traces, or that there are some internal spans you expect to see that are missing. If that's the case, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the New Relic agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the New Relic agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application. Problems with spans Infinite Tracing: missing spans If your APM agent can’t write data fast enough to the trace observer, queue_size is an additional APM agent configuration to limit the number of spans the agent will hold. See the following examples for your agent: .NET configuration method Example Configuration file <configuration . . . > <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer> <span_events queue_size=\"100000\" /> </trace_observer> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy Environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_EVENTS_QUEUE_SIZE=100000 Copy Python configuration method Example Configuration file infinite_tracing.span_queue_size = 100000 Environment Variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000 Missing span not getting exported Sometimes header propagation is successful, but the span information isn't getting sent to New Relic. For example, if OpenTelemetry is not instrumented with a New Relic exporter, the span details never make it to New Relic. In this diagram, notice that the header propagation is successful, but no exporter is set up in Service 2 to send the span to New Relic: The following diagram also shows successful header propagation, but it includes an exporter in Service 2 that sends the span details to New Relic (see Trace API): Missing spans due to sampling process Standard distributed tracing for APM uses adaptive sampling. This means that a percentage of calls to a service will be reported as part of a distributed trace. Specific calls to your service might not have been selected to be sampled. Missing spans due to span limits maxed out There are limits on the number of spans that can be collected and displayed. If an application generates a very large number of spans for a single call, it might exceed the APM agent's span-collection limit for that harvest cycle. This could result in missing spans and significantly limit the number of traces the agent can completely sample and report. We currently only show 10,000 spans at a time. Missing spans due to spans being sent late Spans must be sent within the last twenty minutes to be captured in a trace index. If you send any spans older than twenty minutes but newer than a day, the span data will still be written. However, it won't be rolled into the trace index, which controls the trace list in the distributed tracing UI. If a span has a timestamp older than a day, it will be dropped. This often occurs when there is clock skew (timing differences) between systems or long running background jobs. Problems with trace details Middleware doesn't recognize proprietary New Relic header If your transactions are only sending the proprietary New Relic header, some middleware might not recognize the format and then drop the information as shown in this diagram: One solution is to upgrade your New Relic agent to a version that supports W3C trace context. In the diagram below, the W3C-compliant New Relic agent passes the prior header along with two standardized headers: An intermediary is missing or isn't passing trace context Some potential problems with proxies and other intermediaries: Incomplete trace. Some intermediaries won't automatically propagate the distributed tracing header. In that case, you must configure that component to allow the header to be passed from source to destination. For instructions, consult the documentation for that intermediary component. Missing intermediary in trace. If the intermediary is New Relic-monitored, ensure that it propagates the newrelic header that is generated or updated by the New Relic agent running on that intermediary. This may manifest when an intermediary was previously visible in traces, but disappeared after distributed tracing was enabled for an upstream entity (for example, a browser-monitored application). Tip If some entities report trace data to another tracing system, you can use the trace ID from the New Relic UI to search other tracing systems for missing spans. Stitching together spans from mixed sources If each agent in a chain supports W3C Trace Context, then we can stitch the spans together into a complete trace. If part of the chain is from an agent, such as Zipkin, which doesn't support W3C Trace Context, then spans coming from that agent may not be included in the trace. Trace details are obfuscated If a trace contains data from applications monitored by multiple New Relic accounts, and your user permissions don't allow you to access those accounts, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. For example, you may see a series of asterisks ( * * * * * ) instead of the service name in your distributed tracing list if you don't have access to the account linked with the service. Trace list information and trace details don't match The trace list is generated by trace indexes, which are captured in a twenty minute window from when the first spans are received. Usually, this is due to late spans. Long traces with short backend times If you're seeing unusually short backend times for long traces, this is likely an issue with the timestamps being sent. For example, the root span might be reposting microseconds as milliseconds. This can also happen if the root span is a browser application. When using an external client like a web browser, you may experience clock skew (timing differences) more often. Problems with browser applications Missing spans and transactions after enabling for a browser application Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If the browser application makes an AJAX request to an APM application running an incompatible agent, then the APM agent may not record transaction and span data for that request. If distributed tracing is enabled for a browser application and you are not seeing transaction or span data for downstream APM requests, review the browser data in distributed tracing requirements, and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. Not seeing browser app end-user spans If traces seem to be missing end-user spans, be sure you've read and understand the browser distributed tracing requirements and enable procedures. On the AJAX UI page, there are links to the distributed tracing UI regardless of whether there are end-user spans present in that trace. For details about what data generates spans, see Requirements. Browser spans are not connected to other spans Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If APM spans are missing consistently from traces that include browser applications, please refer to the browser data in distributed tracing requirements and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. For other causes of orphaned browser spans, see Browser span reporting. Other problems Search by entity.name not finding associated app names Potential cause: For applications that have multiple app names, the entity.name attribute will be associated only with the primary app name. To search by other app names, search using the appName attribute. Supporting OpenTelemetry Questions about integrating with OpenTelemetry should be taken to the Explorers Hub.",

      "body": "Here is information about using the legacy APM service maps feature to create, customize, and use service maps. For help using the current service maps feature, see How to use service maps. Requirements The legacy service map features in APM depend on your New Relic agent version: Feature Requirements App visibility For your app to appear in service maps, one of the following must be true: Your app must have the minimum agent version required for distributed tracing and have distributed tracing enabled. Note: Mobile monitoring doesn't support distributed tracing yet and will not show relationships to apps that have distributed tracing enabled. Your app must have the minimum APM agent version required for cross app tracing and have cross app tracing enabled. Host and instance visibility To view specific hosts, instances, and types of database information, your agent must meet the same minimum agent versions as the APM database and instance feature and use any of the compatible database drivers. Database-only visibility APM's service maps feature includes the ability to opt out of the deeper, host and instance level view. However, to view databases in service maps without the instance-level details, you must still meet the same minimum agent versions as the Database and slow queries features. Create maps The APM service maps feature helps you create your first map by providing default map or architecture suggestions that automatically build a default map (if you have more than ten reporting apps). To view these suggested maps, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service Maps > Suggested maps. To create a new map: Do one of the following: Start from scratch: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Create new map . Copy an existing map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > Save as new. Name your map. Rearrange, group, or add nodes on the map as needed. Important Previously, you could have private service maps. Now, all users can view, edit, and delete all existing or new service maps in the account. Save and rename maps Here are some tips about saving and renaming maps: Save To save changes to a map, select Save. To create a copy of the current map, select Save as new. Rename To rename a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the pencil icon next to the map name. Change the name, then select Save. Add or remove nodes on maps After you create or save a map, build out your map by adding nodes to it. Nodes are added to the map differently based on the node type. To remove any node from the map, mouse over the node, then select the remove X icon. Applications and mobile apps Nodes for applications or mobile apps need to be added to the map in order to add any other nodes. Nodes are added and connected into the map as you select them. The check mark icon means that node is already on the map. To add New Relic monitored apps or plugins to maps: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. Select any applications from the App/Service list. Rearrange or group together as needed. Browser, databases, external services, connected apps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. To add browser apps, databases, external services, or other connected apps to the map: Select an incoming or outgoing connection widget. From the list of connections, mouse over an app or service, then select the plus icon. Rearrange as needed. Custom nodes To add a custom node to the map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. From the App/Service list, select Create custom node. Name the node. Add connections: Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. Then select the plus icon on your target node. Select Save. Rearrange as needed. To add or remove custom node connections: Mouse over the custom node and select the pencil icon. Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. To add a connection, select the plus icon. To remove a connection, select the minus icon. Select Save. Move around the map Move around the map by panning or zooming in and out. If you want to... Do this... Pan the map In pan mode, click and drag. In drag-select mode, hold the Alt key, then click and drag. Zoom in and out In either mode, zoom in and out by scrolling the mouse wheel. View your entire map in traffic light mode Zoom out until node details fade out and are replaced by health status colors. Toggle the traffic light view on and off Select Views, then select Traffic light mode. View all the nodes and their dependencies Select Discover your environment. Drill down into more detail from a node Use standard UI functions. Select, arrange, group nodes Click on a node to select it and view its performance summary. You can also select multiple nodes at once, to group and ungroup them: Select nodes To select one node, click on the node. To select multiple nodes: Click the drag-select icon to switch to drag-select mode. Click and drag the mouse to draw a square around the nodes you want to select. OR Hold the Shift key and click on each node you want to select. Arrange nodes Caution Auto-arrange cannot be undone. Consider saving a copy of your map first. To arrange nodes on the map, select one or more node, then drag to a snap point on the map. To automatically organize all your nodes and connections, select Auto-arrange map. Group and ungroup nodes If you want to... Do this... Group nodes together on the map Select two or more nodes, then select Create group. Name your new group Mouse over the group, then select the pencil icon. Rename an existing group Select the pencil icon. Remove nodes from a group Select the group, then select the minus icon for each item you want to remove. Delete maps To delete a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the map name's pencil icon. Select Delete map. Identify issues with external services If your app connects to an external service that New Relic does not monitor (for example, a third-party API), New Relic watches the service for a week in order to baseline its response time. If New Relic can collect a statistically significant number of data points (more than 100), New Relic compares the current response time to this baseline and uses this to set the health status indicator: Green: Response time from the service is less than 1.75 times the baseline. Yellow: Response time from the service is longer than 1.75 times the baseline. Red: Response time from the service is longer than 2.5 times the baseline. Gray: Alerts concluded it does not have enough data to determine the health status. Purple: Alerts cannot yet conclude if it has enough data to determine the health status. Visualize and monitor complex architectures Use service maps to visualize and monitor complex architectures. For a tutorial introducing the latest features, select the service map's question icon. Nodes Nodes are the basic building blocks for your map. You can add a variety of node types including: Node type Description New Relic APM-monitored app Add your app to the map to view their connections to databases, browser apps, out-of-process services, and other instrumented apps. (In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are also referred to as web external or background external data.) Browser apps Automatically detected for each app and added via the incoming connections widget. Only displays browser apps linked to an APM app (standalone browser apps are not supported). New Relic mobile monitoring apps Automatically detected and added via the app/service list panel. Plugins, including Databases Automatically detected for each app and added via the connections widget. Databases in service maps require the same agent versions as the new Database page features. External services Service maps automatically detects external services (visible in the connections widget), to track your app's external dependencies and monitor the health of those connections. Custom nodes Add custom nodes via the app/service list panel to include apps and services not automatically instrumented by New Relic (for example, load balancers, implementation planning, and so on). Group nodes A group node contains multiple other nodes. For apps, group nodes include a summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. Node arrangement and grouping Click and drag a node to move it around the map, for a customizable view of your architecture. App nodes can also be grouped together into a single node to better organize related apps and services. Grouped nodes include summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. To remove items from a group, mouse over the group and select the pencil pencil icon, then select the minus minus-circle icon to remove the item from the group. Incoming and outgoing connections Service maps automatically detects incoming and outgoing connections based on HTTP calls between entities. Mouse over a node to highlight the node's connections. Widgets at the end of each node display a count of that node's connections, and you can click on those widgets to add related entities to the map: View performance summary Click on an app to view its performance over the last 30 minutes. The chart defaults to Response time, but you can view other metrics by selecting any of the available Apdex, Throughput, or Error rate links. While charts use the last 30 minutes of performance data, the service map as a whole is based on the last five minutes. View the app in APM or browser and view its labels by selecting the overflow ellipsis-v icon. Click the app name again to hide the summary charts, and select the overflow ellipsis-h icon again to hide other details. Map list and app/service list panels Select the Map list panel to: Search for and view your maps, and access other users' shared maps. Create a new map. Select the App/Service List panel to: Add new apps, mobile apps, and plugins to your map. Create custom nodes and add them to the map. Health status and performance metrics You can see health status indicators for most nodes. Except for out-of-process services (external services or background services), entities use the health status indicators used by New Relic Alerts. For out-of-process (external) services, the health status indicator measures the health of the connection to the external service. View all connected apps and services The Discover your environment feature allows you to view all of your apps, services, and dependencies together with a single click. This feature detects all connected applications and services (including externals and databases) to give you a comprehensive view of your overall software architecture environment. To view all connected apps and services: In APM, select Service maps. From your Map list, select Discover your environment to display all of your nodes. Hover over any node to view its dependencies and how it connects to other parts of your service map. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view their details. The Discover your environment feature may not be available if you are using an older New Relic agent version. See Troubleshooting cross application tracing for version information. This feature may also not be available for highly complex service maps with many elements. Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Discover your environment: Use this option to view all of your nodes and their dependencies in one place. Traffic light mode Traffic light mode lets you view the health status of your entire architecture at a glance. This feature helps you quickly find service and app problems, even within a complex environment with many nodes. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Traffic light mode. When traffic lights mode is On, zooming out far enough on a service map eventually causes the nodes to switch from displaying textual information, to only health status colors. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view more details. Traffic light mode is on by default. When traffic lights mode is Off, service map nodes retain their textual information and do not switch to health status colors, No matter how far you zoom out. one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Views > Traffic light mode: When traffic light mode is enabled, zooming out of your service map displays nodes in health status colors. Midnight mode Midnight mode inverts the screen's colors, going from a white background to a dark background. Midnight mode reduces eye strain, especially in low light environments. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Midnight mode.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Problem You have enabled distributed tracing but data you expected to see does not appear in New Relic's distributed tracing UI. Solution Important Before performing troubleshooting, we recommend reading How distributed tracing works. Here are some causes and solutions when you have problems finding expected data in the distributed tracing UI: Problems with enabling or instrumenting Missing spans due to service not having distributed tracing enabled In order for distributed tracing to report details for all nodes in a trace, each application must be monitored by a New Relic agent that has had distributed tracing enabled. If an application's New Relic account has not had distributed tracing enabled, it will have these issues: Its distributed tracing UI page won't have data. It won't report data to other accounts' distributed traces. Missing apps/services may require manual instrumentation When you enable distributed tracing for applications and services that New Relic automatically instruments, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some services or applications are missing from traces, or that there are some internal spans you expect to see that are missing. If that's the case, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the New Relic agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the New Relic agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application. Problems with spans Infinite Tracing: missing spans If your APM agent can’t write data fast enough to the trace observer, queue_size is an additional APM agent configuration to limit the number of spans the agent will hold. See the following examples for your agent: .NET configuration method Example Configuration file <configuration . . . > <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer> <span_events queue_size=\"100000\" /> </trace_observer> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy Environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_EVENTS_QUEUE_SIZE=100000 Copy Python configuration method Example Configuration file infinite_tracing.span_queue_size = 100000 Environment Variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000 Missing span not getting exported Sometimes header propagation is successful, but the span information isn't getting sent to New Relic. For example, if OpenTelemetry is not instrumented with a New Relic exporter, the span details never make it to New Relic. In this diagram, notice that the header propagation is successful, but no exporter is set up in Service 2 to send the span to New Relic: The following diagram also shows successful header propagation, but it includes an exporter in Service 2 that sends the span details to New Relic (see Trace API): Missing spans due to sampling process Standard distributed tracing for APM uses adaptive sampling. This means that a percentage of calls to a service will be reported as part of a distributed trace. Specific calls to your service might not have been selected to be sampled. Missing spans due to span limits maxed out There are limits on the number of spans that can be collected and displayed. If an application generates a very large number of spans for a single call, it might exceed the APM agent's span-collection limit for that harvest cycle. This could result in missing spans and significantly limit the number of traces the agent can completely sample and report. We currently only show 10,000 spans at a time. Missing spans due to spans being sent late Spans must be sent within the last twenty minutes to be captured in a trace index. If you send any spans older than twenty minutes but newer than a day, the span data will still be written. However, it won't be rolled into the trace index, which controls the trace list in the distributed tracing UI. If a span has a timestamp older than a day, it will be dropped. This often occurs when there is clock skew (timing differences) between systems or long running background jobs. Problems with trace details Middleware doesn't recognize proprietary New Relic header If your transactions are only sending the proprietary New Relic header, some middleware might not recognize the format and then drop the information as shown in this diagram: One solution is to upgrade your New Relic agent to a version that supports W3C trace context. In the diagram below, the W3C-compliant New Relic agent passes the prior header along with two standardized headers: An intermediary is missing or isn't passing trace context Some potential problems with proxies and other intermediaries: Incomplete trace. Some intermediaries won't automatically propagate the distributed tracing header. In that case, you must configure that component to allow the header to be passed from source to destination. For instructions, consult the documentation for that intermediary component. Missing intermediary in trace. If the intermediary is New Relic-monitored, ensure that it propagates the newrelic header that is generated or updated by the New Relic agent running on that intermediary. This may manifest when an intermediary was previously visible in traces, but disappeared after distributed tracing was enabled for an upstream entity (for example, a browser-monitored application). Tip If some entities report trace data to another tracing system, you can use the trace ID from the New Relic UI to search other tracing systems for missing spans. Stitching together spans from mixed sources If each agent in a chain supports W3C Trace Context, then we can stitch the spans together into a complete trace. If part of the chain is from an agent, such as Zipkin, which doesn't support W3C Trace Context, then spans coming from that agent may not be included in the trace. Trace details are obfuscated If a trace contains data from applications monitored by multiple New Relic accounts, and your user permissions don't allow you to access those accounts, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. For example, you may see a series of asterisks ( * * * * * ) instead of the service name in your distributed tracing list if you don't have access to the account linked with the service. Trace list information and trace details don't match The trace list is generated by trace indexes, which are captured in a twenty minute window from when the first spans are received. Usually, this is due to late spans. Long traces with short backend times If you're seeing unusually short backend times for long traces, this is likely an issue with the timestamps being sent. For example, the root span might be reposting microseconds as milliseconds. This can also happen if the root span is a browser application. When using an external client like a web browser, you may experience clock skew (timing differences) more often. Problems with browser applications Missing spans and transactions after enabling for a browser application Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If the browser application makes an AJAX request to an APM application running an incompatible agent, then the APM agent may not record transaction and span data for that request. If distributed tracing is enabled for a browser application and you are not seeing transaction or span data for downstream APM requests, review the browser data in distributed tracing requirements, and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. Not seeing browser app end-user spans If traces seem to be missing end-user spans, be sure you've read and understand the browser distributed tracing requirements and enable procedures. On the AJAX UI page, there are links to the distributed tracing UI regardless of whether there are end-user spans present in that trace. For details about what data generates spans, see Requirements. Browser spans are not connected to other spans Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If APM spans are missing consistently from traces that include browser applications, please refer to the browser data in distributed tracing requirements and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. For other causes of orphaned browser spans, see Browser span reporting. Other problems Search by entity.name not finding associated app names Potential cause: For applications that have multiple app names, the entity.name attribute will be associated only with the primary app name. To search by other app names, search using the appName attribute. Supporting OpenTelemetry Questions about integrating with OpenTelemetry should be taken to the Explorers Hub.",

      "body": "Here is information about using the legacy APM service maps feature to create, customize, and use service maps. For help using the current service maps feature, see How to use service maps. Requirements The legacy service map features in APM depend on your New Relic agent version: Feature Requirements App visibility For your app to appear in service maps, one of the following must be true: Your app must have the minimum agent version required for distributed tracing and have distributed tracing enabled. Note: Mobile monitoring doesn't support distributed tracing yet and will not show relationships to apps that have distributed tracing enabled. Your app must have the minimum APM agent version required for cross app tracing and have cross app tracing enabled. Host and instance visibility To view specific hosts, instances, and types of database information, your agent must meet the same minimum agent versions as the APM database and instance feature and use any of the compatible database drivers. Database-only visibility APM's service maps feature includes the ability to opt out of the deeper, host and instance level view. However, to view databases in service maps without the instance-level details, you must still meet the same minimum agent versions as the Database and slow queries features. Create maps The APM service maps feature helps you create your first map by providing default map or architecture suggestions that automatically build a default map (if you have more than ten reporting apps). To view these suggested maps, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service Maps > Suggested maps. To create a new map: Do one of the following: Start from scratch: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Create new map . Copy an existing map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > Save as new. Name your map. Rearrange, group, or add nodes on the map as needed. Important Previously, you could have private service maps. Now, all users can view, edit, and delete all existing or new service maps in the account. Save and rename maps Here are some tips about saving and renaming maps: Save To save changes to a map, select Save. To create a copy of the current map, select Save as new. Rename To rename a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the pencil icon next to the map name. Change the name, then select Save. Add or remove nodes on maps After you create or save a map, build out your map by adding nodes to it. Nodes are added to the map differently based on the node type. To remove any node from the map, mouse over the node, then select the remove X icon. Applications and mobile apps Nodes for applications or mobile apps need to be added to the map in order to add any other nodes. Nodes are added and connected into the map as you select them. The check mark icon means that node is already on the map. To add New Relic monitored apps or plugins to maps: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. Select any applications from the App/Service list. Rearrange or group together as needed. Browser, databases, external services, connected apps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. To add browser apps, databases, external services, or other connected apps to the map: Select an incoming or outgoing connection widget. From the list of connections, mouse over an app or service, then select the plus icon. Rearrange as needed. Custom nodes To add a custom node to the map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. From the App/Service list, select Create custom node. Name the node. Add connections: Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. Then select the plus icon on your target node. Select Save. Rearrange as needed. To add or remove custom node connections: Mouse over the custom node and select the pencil icon. Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. To add a connection, select the plus icon. To remove a connection, select the minus icon. Select Save. Move around the map Move around the map by panning or zooming in and out. If you want to... Do this... Pan the map In pan mode, click and drag. In drag-select mode, hold the Alt key, then click and drag. Zoom in and out In either mode, zoom in and out by scrolling the mouse wheel. View your entire map in traffic light mode Zoom out until node details fade out and are replaced by health status colors. Toggle the traffic light view on and off Select Views, then select Traffic light mode. View all the nodes and their dependencies Select Discover your environment. Drill down into more detail from a node Use standard UI functions. Select, arrange, group nodes Click on a node to select it and view its performance summary. You can also select multiple nodes at once, to group and ungroup them: Select nodes To select one node, click on the node. To select multiple nodes: Click the drag-select icon to switch to drag-select mode. Click and drag the mouse to draw a square around the nodes you want to select. OR Hold the Shift key and click on each node you want to select. Arrange nodes Caution Auto-arrange cannot be undone. Consider saving a copy of your map first. To arrange nodes on the map, select one or more node, then drag to a snap point on the map. To automatically organize all your nodes and connections, select Auto-arrange map. Group and ungroup nodes If you want to... Do this... Group nodes together on the map Select two or more nodes, then select Create group. Name your new group Mouse over the group, then select the pencil icon. Rename an existing group Select the pencil icon. Remove nodes from a group Select the group, then select the minus icon for each item you want to remove. Delete maps To delete a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the map name's pencil icon. Select Delete map. Identify issues with external services If your app connects to an external service that New Relic does not monitor (for example, a third-party API), New Relic watches the service for a week in order to baseline its response time. If New Relic can collect a statistically significant number of data points (more than 100), New Relic compares the current response time to this baseline and uses this to set the health status indicator: Green: Response time from the service is less than 1.75 times the baseline. Yellow: Response time from the service is longer than 1.75 times the baseline. Red: Response time from the service is longer than 2.5 times the baseline. Gray: Alerts concluded it does not have enough data to determine the health status. Purple: Alerts cannot yet conclude if it has enough data to determine the health status. Visualize and monitor complex architectures Use service maps to visualize and monitor complex architectures. For a tutorial introducing the latest features, select the service map's question icon. Nodes Nodes are the basic building blocks for your map. You can add a variety of node types including: Node type Description New Relic APM-monitored app Add your app to the map to view their connections to databases, browser apps, out-of-process services, and other instrumented apps. (In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are also referred to as web external or background external data.) Browser apps Automatically detected for each app and added via the incoming connections widget. Only displays browser apps linked to an APM app (standalone browser apps are not supported). New Relic mobile monitoring apps Automatically detected and added via the app/service list panel. Plugins, including Databases Automatically detected for each app and added via the connections widget. Databases in service maps require the same agent versions as the new Database page features. External services Service maps automatically detects external services (visible in the connections widget), to track your app's external dependencies and monitor the health of those connections. Custom nodes Add custom nodes via the app/service list panel to include apps and services not automatically instrumented by New Relic (for example, load balancers, implementation planning, and so on). Group nodes A group node contains multiple other nodes. For apps, group nodes include a summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. Node arrangement and grouping Click and drag a node to move it around the map, for a customizable view of your architecture. App nodes can also be grouped together into a single node to better organize related apps and services. Grouped nodes include summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. To remove items from a group, mouse over the group and select the pencil pencil icon, then select the minus minus-circle icon to remove the item from the group. Incoming and outgoing connections Service maps automatically detects incoming and outgoing connections based on HTTP calls between entities. Mouse over a node to highlight the node's connections. Widgets at the end of each node display a count of that node's connections, and you can click on those widgets to add related entities to the map: View performance summary Click on an app to view its performance over the last 30 minutes. The chart defaults to Response time, but you can view other metrics by selecting any of the available Apdex, Throughput, or Error rate links. While charts use the last 30 minutes of performance data, the service map as a whole is based on the last five minutes. View the app in APM or browser and view its labels by selecting the overflow ellipsis-v icon. Click the app name again to hide the summary charts, and select the overflow ellipsis-h icon again to hide other details. Map list and app/service list panels Select the Map list panel to: Search for and view your maps, and access other users' shared maps. Create a new map. Select the App/Service List panel to: Add new apps, mobile apps, and plugins to your map. Create custom nodes and add them to the map. Health status and performance metrics You can see health status indicators for most nodes. Except for out-of-process services (external services or background services), entities use the health status indicators used by New Relic Alerts. For out-of-process (external) services, the health status indicator measures the health of the connection to the external service. View all connected apps and services The Discover your environment feature allows you to view all of your apps, services, and dependencies together with a single click. This feature detects all connected applications and services (including externals and databases) to give you a comprehensive view of your overall software architecture environment. To view all connected apps and services: In APM, select Service maps. From your Map list, select Discover your environment to display all of your nodes. Hover over any node to view its dependencies and how it connects to other parts of your service map. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view their details. The Discover your environment feature may not be available if you are using an older New Relic agent version. See Troubleshooting cross application tracing for version information. This feature may also not be available for highly complex service maps with many elements. Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Discover your environment: Use this option to view all of your nodes and their dependencies in one place. Traffic light mode Traffic light mode lets you view the health status of your entire architecture at a glance. This feature helps you quickly find service and app problems, even within a complex environment with many nodes. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Traffic light mode. When traffic lights mode is On, zooming out far enough on a service map eventually causes the nodes to switch from displaying textual information, to only health status colors. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view more details. Traffic light mode is on by default. When traffic lights mode is Off, service map nodes retain their textual information and do not switch to health status colors, No matter how far you zoom out. one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Views > Traffic light mode: When traffic light mode is enabled, zooming out of your service map displays nodes in health status colors. Midnight mode Midnight mode inverts the screen's colors, going from a white background to a dark background. Midnight mode reduces eye strain, especially in low light environments. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Midnight mode.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in mobile, browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

      "body": "Problem You have enabled distributed tracing but data you expected to see does not appear in New Relic's distributed tracing UI. Solution Important Before performing troubleshooting, we recommend reading How distributed tracing works. Here are some causes and solutions when you have problems finding expected data in the distributed tracing UI: Problems with enabling or instrumenting Missing spans due to service not having distributed tracing enabled In order for distributed tracing to report details for all nodes in a trace, each application must be monitored by a New Relic agent that has had distributed tracing enabled. If an application's New Relic account has not had distributed tracing enabled, it will have these issues: Its distributed tracing UI page won't have data. It won't report data to other accounts' distributed traces. Missing apps/services may require manual instrumentation When you enable distributed tracing for applications and services that New Relic automatically instruments, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some services or applications are missing from traces, or that there are some internal spans you expect to see that are missing. If that's the case, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the New Relic agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the New Relic agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application. Problems with spans Infinite Tracing: missing spans If your APM agent can’t write data fast enough to the trace observer, queue_size is an additional APM agent configuration to limit the number of spans the agent will hold. See the following examples for your agent: .NET configuration method Example Configuration file <configuration . . . > <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer> <span_events queue_size=\"100000\" /> </trace_observer> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy Environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_EVENTS_QUEUE_SIZE=100000 Copy Python configuration method Example Configuration file infinite_tracing.span_queue_size = 100000 Environment Variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000 Missing span not getting exported Sometimes header propagation is successful, but the span information isn't getting sent to New Relic. For example, if OpenTelemetry is not instrumented with a New Relic exporter, the span details never make it to New Relic. In this diagram, notice that the header propagation is successful, but no exporter is set up in Service 2 to send the span to New Relic: The following diagram also shows successful header propagation, but it includes an exporter in Service 2 that sends the span details to New Relic (see Trace API): Missing spans due to sampling process Standard distributed tracing for APM uses adaptive sampling. This means that a percentage of calls to a service will be reported as part of a distributed trace. Specific calls to your service might not have been selected to be sampled. Missing spans due to span limits maxed out There are limits on the number of spans that can be collected and displayed. If an application generates a very large number of spans for a single call, it might exceed the APM agent's span-collection limit for that harvest cycle. This could result in missing spans and significantly limit the number of traces the agent can completely sample and report. We currently only show 10,000 spans at a time. Missing spans due to spans being sent late Spans must be sent within the last twenty minutes to be captured in a trace index. If you send any spans older than twenty minutes but newer than a day, the span data will still be written. However, it won't be rolled into the trace index, which controls the trace list in the distributed tracing UI. If a span has a timestamp older than a day, it will be dropped. This often occurs when there is clock skew (timing differences) between systems or long running background jobs. Problems with trace details Middleware doesn't recognize proprietary New Relic header If your transactions are only sending the proprietary New Relic header, some middleware might not recognize the format and then drop the information as shown in this diagram: One solution is to upgrade your New Relic agent to a version that supports W3C trace context. In the diagram below, the W3C-compliant New Relic agent passes the prior header along with two standardized headers: An intermediary is missing or isn't passing trace context Some potential problems with proxies and other intermediaries: Incomplete trace. Some intermediaries won't automatically propagate the distributed tracing header. In that case, you must configure that component to allow the header to be passed from source to destination. For instructions, consult the documentation for that intermediary component. Missing intermediary in trace. If the intermediary is New Relic-monitored, ensure that it propagates the newrelic header that is generated or updated by the New Relic agent running on that intermediary. This may manifest when an intermediary was previously visible in traces, but disappeared after distributed tracing was enabled for an upstream entity (for example, a browser-monitored application). Tip If some entities report trace data to another tracing system, you can use the trace ID from the New Relic UI to search other tracing systems for missing spans. Stitching together spans from mixed sources If each agent in a chain supports W3C Trace Context, then we can stitch the spans together into a complete trace. If part of the chain is from an agent, such as Zipkin, which doesn't support W3C Trace Context, then spans coming from that agent may not be included in the trace. Trace details are obfuscated If a trace contains data from applications monitored by multiple New Relic accounts, and your user permissions don't allow you to access those accounts, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. For example, you may see a series of asterisks ( * * * * * ) instead of the service name in your distributed tracing list if you don't have access to the account linked with the service. Trace list information and trace details don't match The trace list is generated by trace indexes, which are captured in a twenty minute window from when the first spans are received. Usually, this is due to late spans. Long traces with short backend times If you're seeing unusually short backend times for long traces, this is likely an issue with the timestamps being sent. For example, the root span might be reposting microseconds as milliseconds. This can also happen if the root span is a browser application. When using an external client like a web browser, you may experience clock skew (timing differences) more often. Problems with browser applications Missing spans and transactions after enabling for a browser application Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If the browser application makes an AJAX request to an APM application running an incompatible agent, then the APM agent may not record transaction and span data for that request. If distributed tracing is enabled for a browser application and you are not seeing transaction or span data for downstream APM requests, review the browser data in distributed tracing requirements, and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. Not seeing browser app end-user spans If traces seem to be missing end-user spans, be sure you've read and understand the browser distributed tracing requirements and enable procedures. On the AJAX UI page, there are links to the distributed tracing UI regardless of whether there are end-user spans present in that trace. For details about what data generates spans, see Requirements. Browser spans are not connected to other spans Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If APM spans are missing consistently from traces that include browser applications, please refer to the browser data in distributed tracing requirements and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. For other causes of orphaned browser spans, see Browser span reporting. Other problems Search by entity.name not finding associated app names Potential cause: For applications that have multiple app names, the entity.name attribute will be associated only with the primary app name. To search by other app names, search using the appName attribute. Supporting OpenTelemetry Questions about integrating with OpenTelemetry should be taken to the Explorers Hub.",

      "body": "Problem You have enabled distributed tracing but data you expected to see does not appear in New Relic's distributed tracing UI. Solution Important Before performing troubleshooting, we recommend reading How distributed tracing works. Here are some causes and solutions when you have problems finding expected data in the distributed tracing UI: Problems with enabling or instrumenting Missing spans due to service not having distributed tracing enabled In order for distributed tracing to report details for all nodes in a trace, each application must be monitored by a New Relic agent that has had distributed tracing enabled. If an application's New Relic account has not had distributed tracing enabled, it will have these issues: Its distributed tracing UI page won't have data. It won't report data to other accounts' distributed traces. Missing apps/services may require manual instrumentation When you enable distributed tracing for applications and services that New Relic automatically instruments, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some services or applications are missing from traces, or that there are some internal spans you expect to see that are missing. If that's the case, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the New Relic agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the New Relic agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application. Problems with spans Infinite Tracing: missing spans If your APM agent can’t write data fast enough to the trace observer, queue_size is an additional APM agent configuration to limit the number of spans the agent will hold. See the following examples for your agent: .NET configuration method Example Configuration file <configuration . . . > <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer> <span_events queue_size=\"100000\" /> </trace_observer> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy Environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_EVENTS_QUEUE_SIZE=100000 Copy Python configuration method Example Configuration file infinite_tracing.span_queue_size = 100000 Environment Variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000 Missing span not getting exported Sometimes header propagation is successful, but the span information isn't getting sent to New Relic. For example, if OpenTelemetry is not instrumented with a New Relic exporter, the span details never make it to New Relic. In this diagram, notice that the header propagation is successful, but no exporter is set up in Service 2 to send the span to New Relic: The following diagram also shows successful header propagation, but it includes an exporter in Service 2 that sends the span details to New Relic (see Trace API): Missing spans due to sampling process Standard distributed tracing for APM uses adaptive sampling. This means that a percentage of calls to a service will be reported as part of a distributed trace. Specific calls to your service might not have been selected to be sampled. Missing spans due to span limits maxed out There are limits on the number of spans that can be collected and displayed. If an application generates a very large number of spans for a single call, it might exceed the APM agent's span-collection limit for that harvest cycle. This could result in missing spans and significantly limit the number of traces the agent can completely sample and report. We currently only show 10,000 spans at a time. Missing spans due to spans being sent late Spans must be sent within the last twenty minutes to be captured in a trace index. If you send any spans older than twenty minutes but newer than a day, the span data will still be written. However, it won't be rolled into the trace index, which controls the trace list in the distributed tracing UI. If a span has a timestamp older than a day, it will be dropped. This often occurs when there is clock skew (timing differences) between systems or long running background jobs. Problems with trace details Middleware doesn't recognize proprietary New Relic header If your transactions are only sending the proprietary New Relic header, some middleware might not recognize the format and then drop the information as shown in this diagram: One solution is to upgrade your New Relic agent to a version that supports W3C trace context. In the diagram below, the W3C-compliant New Relic agent passes the prior header along with two standardized headers: An intermediary is missing or isn't passing trace context Some potential problems with proxies and other intermediaries: Incomplete trace. Some intermediaries won't automatically propagate the distributed tracing header. In that case, you must configure that component to allow the header to be passed from source to destination. For instructions, consult the documentation for that intermediary component. Missing intermediary in trace. If the intermediary is New Relic-monitored, ensure that it propagates the newrelic header that is generated or updated by the New Relic agent running on that intermediary. This may manifest when an intermediary was previously visible in traces, but disappeared after distributed tracing was enabled for an upstream entity (for example, a browser-monitored application). Tip If some entities report trace data to another tracing system, you can use the trace ID from the New Relic UI to search other tracing systems for missing spans. Stitching together spans from mixed sources If each agent in a chain supports W3C Trace Context, then we can stitch the spans together into a complete trace. If part of the chain is from an agent, such as Zipkin, which doesn't support W3C Trace Context, then spans coming from that agent may not be included in the trace. Trace details are obfuscated If a trace contains data from applications monitored by multiple New Relic accounts, and your user permissions don't allow you to access those accounts, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. For example, you may see a series of asterisks ( * * * * * ) instead of the service name in your distributed tracing list if you don't have access to the account linked with the service. Trace list information and trace details don't match The trace list is generated by trace indexes, which are captured in a twenty minute window from when the first spans are received. Usually, this is due to late spans. Long traces with short backend times If you're seeing unusually short backend times for long traces, this is likely an issue with the timestamps being sent. For example, the root span might be reposting microseconds as milliseconds. This can also happen if the root span is a browser application. When using an external client like a web browser, you may experience clock skew (timing differences) more often. Problems with browser applications Missing spans and transactions after enabling for a browser application Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If the browser application makes an AJAX request to an APM application running an incompatible agent, then the APM agent may not record transaction and span data for that request. If distributed tracing is enabled for a browser application and you are not seeing transaction or span data for downstream APM requests, review the browser data in distributed tracing requirements, and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. Not seeing browser app end-user spans If traces seem to be missing end-user spans, be sure you've read and understand the browser distributed tracing requirements and enable procedures. On the AJAX UI page, there are links to the distributed tracing UI regardless of whether there are end-user spans present in that trace. For details about what data generates spans, see Requirements. Browser spans are not connected to other spans Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If APM spans are missing consistently from traces that include browser applications, please refer to the browser data in distributed tracing requirements and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. For other causes of orphaned browser spans, see Browser span reporting. Other problems Search by entity.name not finding associated app names Potential cause: For applications that have multiple app names, the entity.name attribute will be associated only with the primary app name. To search by other app names, search using the appName attribute. Supporting OpenTelemetry Questions about integrating with OpenTelemetry should be taken to the Explorers Hub.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Here is information about using the legacy APM service maps feature to create, customize, and use service maps. For help using the current service maps feature, see How to use service maps. Requirements The legacy service map features in APM depend on your New Relic agent version: Feature Requirements App visibility For your app to appear in service maps, one of the following must be true: Your app must have the minimum agent version required for distributed tracing and have distributed tracing enabled. Note: Mobile monitoring doesn't support distributed tracing yet and will not show relationships to apps that have distributed tracing enabled. Your app must have the minimum APM agent version required for cross app tracing and have cross app tracing enabled. Host and instance visibility To view specific hosts, instances, and types of database information, your agent must meet the same minimum agent versions as the APM database and instance feature and use any of the compatible database drivers. Database-only visibility APM's service maps feature includes the ability to opt out of the deeper, host and instance level view. However, to view databases in service maps without the instance-level details, you must still meet the same minimum agent versions as the Database and slow queries features. Create maps The APM service maps feature helps you create your first map by providing default map or architecture suggestions that automatically build a default map (if you have more than ten reporting apps). To view these suggested maps, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service Maps > Suggested maps. To create a new map: Do one of the following: Start from scratch: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Create new map . Copy an existing map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > Save as new. Name your map. Rearrange, group, or add nodes on the map as needed. Important Previously, you could have private service maps. Now, all users can view, edit, and delete all existing or new service maps in the account. Save and rename maps Here are some tips about saving and renaming maps: Save To save changes to a map, select Save. To create a copy of the current map, select Save as new. Rename To rename a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the pencil icon next to the map name. Change the name, then select Save. Add or remove nodes on maps After you create or save a map, build out your map by adding nodes to it. Nodes are added to the map differently based on the node type. To remove any node from the map, mouse over the node, then select the remove X icon. Applications and mobile apps Nodes for applications or mobile apps need to be added to the map in order to add any other nodes. Nodes are added and connected into the map as you select them. The check mark icon means that node is already on the map. To add New Relic monitored apps or plugins to maps: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. Select any applications from the App/Service list. Rearrange or group together as needed. Browser, databases, external services, connected apps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. To add browser apps, databases, external services, or other connected apps to the map: Select an incoming or outgoing connection widget. From the list of connections, mouse over an app or service, then select the plus icon. Rearrange as needed. Custom nodes To add a custom node to the map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. From the App/Service list, select Create custom node. Name the node. Add connections: Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. Then select the plus icon on your target node. Select Save. Rearrange as needed. To add or remove custom node connections: Mouse over the custom node and select the pencil icon. Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. To add a connection, select the plus icon. To remove a connection, select the minus icon. Select Save. Move around the map Move around the map by panning or zooming in and out. If you want to... Do this... Pan the map In pan mode, click and drag. In drag-select mode, hold the Alt key, then click and drag. Zoom in and out In either mode, zoom in and out by scrolling the mouse wheel. View your entire map in traffic light mode Zoom out until node details fade out and are replaced by health status colors. Toggle the traffic light view on and off Select Views, then select Traffic light mode. View all the nodes and their dependencies Select Discover your environment. Drill down into more detail from a node Use standard UI functions. Select, arrange, group nodes Click on a node to select it and view its performance summary. You can also select multiple nodes at once, to group and ungroup them: Select nodes To select one node, click on the node. To select multiple nodes: Click the drag-select icon to switch to drag-select mode. Click and drag the mouse to draw a square around the nodes you want to select. OR Hold the Shift key and click on each node you want to select. Arrange nodes Caution Auto-arrange cannot be undone. Consider saving a copy of your map first. To arrange nodes on the map, select one or more node, then drag to a snap point on the map. To automatically organize all your nodes and connections, select Auto-arrange map. Group and ungroup nodes If you want to... Do this... Group nodes together on the map Select two or more nodes, then select Create group. Name your new group Mouse over the group, then select the pencil icon. Rename an existing group Select the pencil icon. Remove nodes from a group Select the group, then select the minus icon for each item you want to remove. Delete maps To delete a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the map name's pencil icon. Select Delete map. Identify issues with external services If your app connects to an external service that New Relic does not monitor (for example, a third-party API), New Relic watches the service for a week in order to baseline its response time. If New Relic can collect a statistically significant number of data points (more than 100), New Relic compares the current response time to this baseline and uses this to set the health status indicator: Green: Response time from the service is less than 1.75 times the baseline. Yellow: Response time from the service is longer than 1.75 times the baseline. Red: Response time from the service is longer than 2.5 times the baseline. Gray: Alerts concluded it does not have enough data to determine the health status. Purple: Alerts cannot yet conclude if it has enough data to determine the health status. Visualize and monitor complex architectures Use service maps to visualize and monitor complex architectures. For a tutorial introducing the latest features, select the service map's question icon. Nodes Nodes are the basic building blocks for your map. You can add a variety of node types including: Node type Description New Relic APM-monitored app Add your app to the map to view their connections to databases, browser apps, out-of-process services, and other instrumented apps. (In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are also referred to as web external or background external data.) Browser apps Automatically detected for each app and added via the incoming connections widget. Only displays browser apps linked to an APM app (standalone browser apps are not supported). New Relic mobile monitoring apps Automatically detected and added via the app/service list panel. Plugins, including Databases Automatically detected for each app and added via the connections widget. Databases in service maps require the same agent versions as the new Database page features. External services Service maps automatically detects external services (visible in the connections widget), to track your app's external dependencies and monitor the health of those connections. Custom nodes Add custom nodes via the app/service list panel to include apps and services not automatically instrumented by New Relic (for example, load balancers, implementation planning, and so on). Group nodes A group node contains multiple other nodes. For apps, group nodes include a summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. Node arrangement and grouping Click and drag a node to move it around the map, for a customizable view of your architecture. App nodes can also be grouped together into a single node to better organize related apps and services. Grouped nodes include summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. To remove items from a group, mouse over the group and select the pencil pencil icon, then select the minus minus-circle icon to remove the item from the group. Incoming and outgoing connections Service maps automatically detects incoming and outgoing connections based on HTTP calls between entities. Mouse over a node to highlight the node's connections. Widgets at the end of each node display a count of that node's connections, and you can click on those widgets to add related entities to the map: View performance summary Click on an app to view its performance over the last 30 minutes. The chart defaults to Response time, but you can view other metrics by selecting any of the available Apdex, Throughput, or Error rate links. While charts use the last 30 minutes of performance data, the service map as a whole is based on the last five minutes. View the app in APM or browser and view its labels by selecting the overflow ellipsis-v icon. Click the app name again to hide the summary charts, and select the overflow ellipsis-h icon again to hide other details. Map list and app/service list panels Select the Map list panel to: Search for and view your maps, and access other users' shared maps. Create a new map. Select the App/Service List panel to: Add new apps, mobile apps, and plugins to your map. Create custom nodes and add them to the map. Health status and performance metrics You can see health status indicators for most nodes. Except for out-of-process services (external services or background services), entities use the health status indicators used by New Relic Alerts. For out-of-process (external) services, the health status indicator measures the health of the connection to the external service. View all connected apps and services The Discover your environment feature allows you to view all of your apps, services, and dependencies together with a single click. This feature detects all connected applications and services (including externals and databases) to give you a comprehensive view of your overall software architecture environment. To view all connected apps and services: In APM, select Service maps. From your Map list, select Discover your environment to display all of your nodes. Hover over any node to view its dependencies and how it connects to other parts of your service map. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view their details. The Discover your environment feature may not be available if you are using an older New Relic agent version. See Troubleshooting cross application tracing for version information. This feature may also not be available for highly complex service maps with many elements. Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Discover your environment: Use this option to view all of your nodes and their dependencies in one place. Traffic light mode Traffic light mode lets you view the health status of your entire architecture at a glance. This feature helps you quickly find service and app problems, even within a complex environment with many nodes. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Traffic light mode. When traffic lights mode is On, zooming out far enough on a service map eventually causes the nodes to switch from displaying textual information, to only health status colors. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view more details. Traffic light mode is on by default. When traffic lights mode is Off, service map nodes retain their textual information and do not switch to health status colors, No matter how far you zoom out. one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Views > Traffic light mode: When traffic light mode is enabled, zooming out of your service map displays nodes in health status colors. Midnight mode Midnight mode inverts the screen's colors, going from a white background to a dark background. Midnight mode reduces eye strain, especially in low light environments. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Midnight mode.",

      "body": "Problem You have enabled distributed tracing but data you expected to see does not appear in New Relic's distributed tracing UI. Solution Important Before performing troubleshooting, we recommend reading How distributed tracing works. Here are some causes and solutions when you have problems finding expected data in the distributed tracing UI: Problems with enabling or instrumenting Missing spans due to service not having distributed tracing enabled In order for distributed tracing to report details for all nodes in a trace, each application must be monitored by a New Relic agent that has had distributed tracing enabled. If an application's New Relic account has not had distributed tracing enabled, it will have these issues: Its distributed tracing UI page won't have data. It won't report data to other accounts' distributed traces. Missing apps/services may require manual instrumentation When you enable distributed tracing for applications and services that New Relic automatically instruments, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some services or applications are missing from traces, or that there are some internal spans you expect to see that are missing. If that's the case, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the New Relic agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the New Relic agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application. Problems with spans Infinite Tracing: missing spans If your APM agent can’t write data fast enough to the trace observer, queue_size is an additional APM agent configuration to limit the number of spans the agent will hold. See the following examples for your agent: .NET configuration method Example Configuration file <configuration . . . > <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer> <span_events queue_size=\"100000\" /> </trace_observer> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy Environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_EVENTS_QUEUE_SIZE=100000 Copy Python configuration method Example Configuration file infinite_tracing.span_queue_size = 100000 Environment Variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000 Missing span not getting exported Sometimes header propagation is successful, but the span information isn't getting sent to New Relic. For example, if OpenTelemetry is not instrumented with a New Relic exporter, the span details never make it to New Relic. In this diagram, notice that the header propagation is successful, but no exporter is set up in Service 2 to send the span to New Relic: The following diagram also shows successful header propagation, but it includes an exporter in Service 2 that sends the span details to New Relic (see Trace API): Missing spans due to sampling process Standard distributed tracing for APM uses adaptive sampling. This means that a percentage of calls to a service will be reported as part of a distributed trace. Specific calls to your service might not have been selected to be sampled. Missing spans due to span limits maxed out There are limits on the number of spans that can be collected and displayed. If an application generates a very large number of spans for a single call, it might exceed the APM agent's span-collection limit for that harvest cycle. This could result in missing spans and significantly limit the number of traces the agent can completely sample and report. We currently only show 10,000 spans at a time. Missing spans due to spans being sent late Spans must be sent within the last twenty minutes to be captured in a trace index. If you send any spans older than twenty minutes but newer than a day, the span data will still be written. However, it won't be rolled into the trace index, which controls the trace list in the distributed tracing UI. If a span has a timestamp older than a day, it will be dropped. This often occurs when there is clock skew (timing differences) between systems or long running background jobs. Problems with trace details Middleware doesn't recognize proprietary New Relic header If your transactions are only sending the proprietary New Relic header, some middleware might not recognize the format and then drop the information as shown in this diagram: One solution is to upgrade your New Relic agent to a version that supports W3C trace context. In the diagram below, the W3C-compliant New Relic agent passes the prior header along with two standardized headers: An intermediary is missing or isn't passing trace context Some potential problems with proxies and other intermediaries: Incomplete trace. Some intermediaries won't automatically propagate the distributed tracing header. In that case, you must configure that component to allow the header to be passed from source to destination. For instructions, consult the documentation for that intermediary component. Missing intermediary in trace. If the intermediary is New Relic-monitored, ensure that it propagates the newrelic header that is generated or updated by the New Relic agent running on that intermediary. This may manifest when an intermediary was previously visible in traces, but disappeared after distributed tracing was enabled for an upstream entity (for example, a browser-monitored application). Tip If some entities report trace data to another tracing system, you can use the trace ID from the New Relic UI to search other tracing systems for missing spans. Stitching together spans from mixed sources If each agent in a chain supports W3C Trace Context, then we can stitch the spans together into a complete trace. If part of the chain is from an agent, such as Zipkin, which doesn't support W3C Trace Context, then spans coming from that agent may not be included in the trace. Trace details are obfuscated If a trace contains data from applications monitored by multiple New Relic accounts, and your user permissions don't allow you to access those accounts, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. For example, you may see a series of asterisks ( * * * * * ) instead of the service name in your distributed tracing list if you don't have access to the account linked with the service. Trace list information and trace details don't match The trace list is generated by trace indexes, which are captured in a twenty minute window from when the first spans are received. Usually, this is due to late spans. Long traces with short backend times If you're seeing unusually short backend times for long traces, this is likely an issue with the timestamps being sent. For example, the root span might be reposting microseconds as milliseconds. This can also happen if the root span is a browser application. When using an external client like a web browser, you may experience clock skew (timing differences) more often. Problems with browser applications Missing spans and transactions after enabling for a browser application Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If the browser application makes an AJAX request to an APM application running an incompatible agent, then the APM agent may not record transaction and span data for that request. If distributed tracing is enabled for a browser application and you are not seeing transaction or span data for downstream APM requests, review the browser data in distributed tracing requirements, and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. Not seeing browser app end-user spans If traces seem to be missing end-user spans, be sure you've read and understand the browser distributed tracing requirements and enable procedures. On the AJAX UI page, there are links to the distributed tracing UI regardless of whether there are end-user spans present in that trace. For details about what data generates spans, see Requirements. Browser spans are not connected to other spans Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If APM spans are missing consistently from traces that include browser applications, please refer to the browser data in distributed tracing requirements and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. For other causes of orphaned browser spans, see Browser span reporting. Other problems Search by entity.name not finding associated app names Potential cause: For applications that have multiple app names, the entity.name attribute will be associated only with the primary app name. To search by other app names, search using the appName attribute. Supporting OpenTelemetry Questions about integrating with OpenTelemetry should be taken to the Explorers Hub.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Here is information about using the legacy APM service maps feature to create, customize, and use service maps. For help using the current service maps feature, see How to use service maps. Requirements The legacy service map features in APM depend on your New Relic agent version: Feature Requirements App visibility For your app to appear in service maps, one of the following must be true: Your app must have the minimum agent version required for distributed tracing and have distributed tracing enabled. Note: Mobile monitoring doesn't support distributed tracing yet and will not show relationships to apps that have distributed tracing enabled. Your app must have the minimum APM agent version required for cross app tracing and have cross app tracing enabled. Host and instance visibility To view specific hosts, instances, and types of database information, your agent must meet the same minimum agent versions as the APM database and instance feature and use any of the compatible database drivers. Database-only visibility APM's service maps feature includes the ability to opt out of the deeper, host and instance level view. However, to view databases in service maps without the instance-level details, you must still meet the same minimum agent versions as the Database and slow queries features. Create maps The APM service maps feature helps you create your first map by providing default map or architecture suggestions that automatically build a default map (if you have more than ten reporting apps). To view these suggested maps, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service Maps > Suggested maps. To create a new map: Do one of the following: Start from scratch: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Create new map . Copy an existing map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > Save as new. Name your map. Rearrange, group, or add nodes on the map as needed. Important Previously, you could have private service maps. Now, all users can view, edit, and delete all existing or new service maps in the account. Save and rename maps Here are some tips about saving and renaming maps: Save To save changes to a map, select Save. To create a copy of the current map, select Save as new. Rename To rename a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the pencil icon next to the map name. Change the name, then select Save. Add or remove nodes on maps After you create or save a map, build out your map by adding nodes to it. Nodes are added to the map differently based on the node type. To remove any node from the map, mouse over the node, then select the remove X icon. Applications and mobile apps Nodes for applications or mobile apps need to be added to the map in order to add any other nodes. Nodes are added and connected into the map as you select them. The check mark icon means that node is already on the map. To add New Relic monitored apps or plugins to maps: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. Select any applications from the App/Service list. Rearrange or group together as needed. Browser, databases, external services, connected apps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. To add browser apps, databases, external services, or other connected apps to the map: Select an incoming or outgoing connection widget. From the list of connections, mouse over an app or service, then select the plus icon. Rearrange as needed. Custom nodes To add a custom node to the map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. From the App/Service list, select Create custom node. Name the node. Add connections: Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. Then select the plus icon on your target node. Select Save. Rearrange as needed. To add or remove custom node connections: Mouse over the custom node and select the pencil icon. Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. To add a connection, select the plus icon. To remove a connection, select the minus icon. Select Save. Move around the map Move around the map by panning or zooming in and out. If you want to... Do this... Pan the map In pan mode, click and drag. In drag-select mode, hold the Alt key, then click and drag. Zoom in and out In either mode, zoom in and out by scrolling the mouse wheel. View your entire map in traffic light mode Zoom out until node details fade out and are replaced by health status colors. Toggle the traffic light view on and off Select Views, then select Traffic light mode. View all the nodes and their dependencies Select Discover your environment. Drill down into more detail from a node Use standard UI functions. Select, arrange, group nodes Click on a node to select it and view its performance summary. You can also select multiple nodes at once, to group and ungroup them: Select nodes To select one node, click on the node. To select multiple nodes: Click the drag-select icon to switch to drag-select mode. Click and drag the mouse to draw a square around the nodes you want to select. OR Hold the Shift key and click on each node you want to select. Arrange nodes Caution Auto-arrange cannot be undone. Consider saving a copy of your map first. To arrange nodes on the map, select one or more node, then drag to a snap point on the map. To automatically organize all your nodes and connections, select Auto-arrange map. Group and ungroup nodes If you want to... Do this... Group nodes together on the map Select two or more nodes, then select Create group. Name your new group Mouse over the group, then select the pencil icon. Rename an existing group Select the pencil icon. Remove nodes from a group Select the group, then select the minus icon for each item you want to remove. Delete maps To delete a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the map name's pencil icon. Select Delete map. Identify issues with external services If your app connects to an external service that New Relic does not monitor (for example, a third-party API), New Relic watches the service for a week in order to baseline its response time. If New Relic can collect a statistically significant number of data points (more than 100), New Relic compares the current response time to this baseline and uses this to set the health status indicator: Green: Response time from the service is less than 1.75 times the baseline. Yellow: Response time from the service is longer than 1.75 times the baseline. Red: Response time from the service is longer than 2.5 times the baseline. Gray: Alerts concluded it does not have enough data to determine the health status. Purple: Alerts cannot yet conclude if it has enough data to determine the health status. Visualize and monitor complex architectures Use service maps to visualize and monitor complex architectures. For a tutorial introducing the latest features, select the service map's question icon. Nodes Nodes are the basic building blocks for your map. You can add a variety of node types including: Node type Description New Relic APM-monitored app Add your app to the map to view their connections to databases, browser apps, out-of-process services, and other instrumented apps. (In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are also referred to as web external or background external data.) Browser apps Automatically detected for each app and added via the incoming connections widget. Only displays browser apps linked to an APM app (standalone browser apps are not supported). New Relic mobile monitoring apps Automatically detected and added via the app/service list panel. Plugins, including Databases Automatically detected for each app and added via the connections widget. Databases in service maps require the same agent versions as the new Database page features. External services Service maps automatically detects external services (visible in the connections widget), to track your app's external dependencies and monitor the health of those connections. Custom nodes Add custom nodes via the app/service list panel to include apps and services not automatically instrumented by New Relic (for example, load balancers, implementation planning, and so on). Group nodes A group node contains multiple other nodes. For apps, group nodes include a summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. Node arrangement and grouping Click and drag a node to move it around the map, for a customizable view of your architecture. App nodes can also be grouped together into a single node to better organize related apps and services. Grouped nodes include summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. To remove items from a group, mouse over the group and select the pencil pencil icon, then select the minus minus-circle icon to remove the item from the group. Incoming and outgoing connections Service maps automatically detects incoming and outgoing connections based on HTTP calls between entities. Mouse over a node to highlight the node's connections. Widgets at the end of each node display a count of that node's connections, and you can click on those widgets to add related entities to the map: View performance summary Click on an app to view its performance over the last 30 minutes. The chart defaults to Response time, but you can view other metrics by selecting any of the available Apdex, Throughput, or Error rate links. While charts use the last 30 minutes of performance data, the service map as a whole is based on the last five minutes. View the app in APM or browser and view its labels by selecting the overflow ellipsis-v icon. Click the app name again to hide the summary charts, and select the overflow ellipsis-h icon again to hide other details. Map list and app/service list panels Select the Map list panel to: Search for and view your maps, and access other users' shared maps. Create a new map. Select the App/Service List panel to: Add new apps, mobile apps, and plugins to your map. Create custom nodes and add them to the map. Health status and performance metrics You can see health status indicators for most nodes. Except for out-of-process services (external services or background services), entities use the health status indicators used by New Relic Alerts. For out-of-process (external) services, the health status indicator measures the health of the connection to the external service. View all connected apps and services The Discover your environment feature allows you to view all of your apps, services, and dependencies together with a single click. This feature detects all connected applications and services (including externals and databases) to give you a comprehensive view of your overall software architecture environment. To view all connected apps and services: In APM, select Service maps. From your Map list, select Discover your environment to display all of your nodes. Hover over any node to view its dependencies and how it connects to other parts of your service map. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view their details. The Discover your environment feature may not be available if you are using an older New Relic agent version. See Troubleshooting cross application tracing for version information. This feature may also not be available for highly complex service maps with many elements. Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Discover your environment: Use this option to view all of your nodes and their dependencies in one place. Traffic light mode Traffic light mode lets you view the health status of your entire architecture at a glance. This feature helps you quickly find service and app problems, even within a complex environment with many nodes. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Traffic light mode. When traffic lights mode is On, zooming out far enough on a service map eventually causes the nodes to switch from displaying textual information, to only health status colors. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view more details. Traffic light mode is on by default. When traffic lights mode is Off, service map nodes retain their textual information and do not switch to health status colors, No matter how far you zoom out. one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Views > Traffic light mode: When traffic light mode is enabled, zooming out of your service map displays nodes in health status colors. Midnight mode Midnight mode inverts the screen's colors, going from a white background to a dark background. Midnight mode reduces eye strain, especially in low light environments. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Midnight mode.",

      "body": "Problem You have enabled distributed tracing but data you expected to see does not appear in New Relic's distributed tracing UI. Solution Important Before performing troubleshooting, we recommend reading How distributed tracing works. Here are some causes and solutions when you have problems finding expected data in the distributed tracing UI: Problems with enabling or instrumenting Missing spans due to service not having distributed tracing enabled In order for distributed tracing to report details for all nodes in a trace, each application must be monitored by a New Relic agent that has had distributed tracing enabled. If an application's New Relic account has not had distributed tracing enabled, it will have these issues: Its distributed tracing UI page won't have data. It won't report data to other accounts' distributed traces. Missing apps/services may require manual instrumentation When you enable distributed tracing for applications and services that New Relic automatically instruments, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some services or applications are missing from traces, or that there are some internal spans you expect to see that are missing. If that's the case, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the New Relic agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the New Relic agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application. Problems with spans Infinite Tracing: missing spans If your APM agent can’t write data fast enough to the trace observer, queue_size is an additional APM agent configuration to limit the number of spans the agent will hold. See the following examples for your agent: .NET configuration method Example Configuration file <configuration . . . > <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer> <span_events queue_size=\"100000\" /> </trace_observer> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy Environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_EVENTS_QUEUE_SIZE=100000 Copy Python configuration method Example Configuration file infinite_tracing.span_queue_size = 100000 Environment Variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000 Missing span not getting exported Sometimes header propagation is successful, but the span information isn't getting sent to New Relic. For example, if OpenTelemetry is not instrumented with a New Relic exporter, the span details never make it to New Relic. In this diagram, notice that the header propagation is successful, but no exporter is set up in Service 2 to send the span to New Relic: The following diagram also shows successful header propagation, but it includes an exporter in Service 2 that sends the span details to New Relic (see Trace API): Missing spans due to sampling process Standard distributed tracing for APM uses adaptive sampling. This means that a percentage of calls to a service will be reported as part of a distributed trace. Specific calls to your service might not have been selected to be sampled. Missing spans due to span limits maxed out There are limits on the number of spans that can be collected and displayed. If an application generates a very large number of spans for a single call, it might exceed the APM agent's span-collection limit for that harvest cycle. This could result in missing spans and significantly limit the number of traces the agent can completely sample and report. We currently only show 10,000 spans at a time. Missing spans due to spans being sent late Spans must be sent within the last twenty minutes to be captured in a trace index. If you send any spans older than twenty minutes but newer than a day, the span data will still be written. However, it won't be rolled into the trace index, which controls the trace list in the distributed tracing UI. If a span has a timestamp older than a day, it will be dropped. This often occurs when there is clock skew (timing differences) between systems or long running background jobs. Problems with trace details Middleware doesn't recognize proprietary New Relic header If your transactions are only sending the proprietary New Relic header, some middleware might not recognize the format and then drop the information as shown in this diagram: One solution is to upgrade your New Relic agent to a version that supports W3C trace context. In the diagram below, the W3C-compliant New Relic agent passes the prior header along with two standardized headers: An intermediary is missing or isn't passing trace context Some potential problems with proxies and other intermediaries: Incomplete trace. Some intermediaries won't automatically propagate the distributed tracing header. In that case, you must configure that component to allow the header to be passed from source to destination. For instructions, consult the documentation for that intermediary component. Missing intermediary in trace. If the intermediary is New Relic-monitored, ensure that it propagates the newrelic header that is generated or updated by the New Relic agent running on that intermediary. This may manifest when an intermediary was previously visible in traces, but disappeared after distributed tracing was enabled for an upstream entity (for example, a browser-monitored application). Tip If some entities report trace data to another tracing system, you can use the trace ID from the New Relic UI to search other tracing systems for missing spans. Stitching together spans from mixed sources If each agent in a chain supports W3C Trace Context, then we can stitch the spans together into a complete trace. If part of the chain is from an agent, such as Zipkin, which doesn't support W3C Trace Context, then spans coming from that agent may not be included in the trace. Trace details are obfuscated If a trace contains data from applications monitored by multiple New Relic accounts, and your user permissions don't allow you to access those accounts, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. For example, you may see a series of asterisks ( * * * * * ) instead of the service name in your distributed tracing list if you don't have access to the account linked with the service. Trace list information and trace details don't match The trace list is generated by trace indexes, which are captured in a twenty minute window from when the first spans are received. Usually, this is due to late spans. Long traces with short backend times If you're seeing unusually short backend times for long traces, this is likely an issue with the timestamps being sent. For example, the root span might be reposting microseconds as milliseconds. This can also happen if the root span is a browser application. When using an external client like a web browser, you may experience clock skew (timing differences) more often. Problems with browser applications Missing spans and transactions after enabling for a browser application Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If the browser application makes an AJAX request to an APM application running an incompatible agent, then the APM agent may not record transaction and span data for that request. If distributed tracing is enabled for a browser application and you are not seeing transaction or span data for downstream APM requests, review the browser data in distributed tracing requirements, and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. Not seeing browser app end-user spans If traces seem to be missing end-user spans, be sure you've read and understand the browser distributed tracing requirements and enable procedures. On the AJAX UI page, there are links to the distributed tracing UI regardless of whether there are end-user spans present in that trace. For details about what data generates spans, see Requirements. Browser spans are not connected to other spans Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If APM spans are missing consistently from traces that include browser applications, please refer to the browser data in distributed tracing requirements and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. For other causes of orphaned browser spans, see Browser span reporting. Other problems Search by entity.name not finding associated app names Potential cause: For applications that have multiple app names, the entity.name attribute will be associated only with the primary app name. To search by other app names, search using the appName attribute. Supporting OpenTelemetry Questions about integrating with OpenTelemetry should be taken to the Explorers Hub.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Here is information about using the legacy APM service maps feature to create, customize, and use service maps. For help using the current service maps feature, see How to use service maps. Requirements The legacy service map features in APM depend on your New Relic agent version: Feature Requirements App visibility For your app to appear in service maps, one of the following must be true: Your app must have the minimum agent version required for distributed tracing and have distributed tracing enabled. Note: Mobile monitoring doesn't support distributed tracing yet and will not show relationships to apps that have distributed tracing enabled. Your app must have the minimum APM agent version required for cross app tracing and have cross app tracing enabled. Host and instance visibility To view specific hosts, instances, and types of database information, your agent must meet the same minimum agent versions as the APM database and instance feature and use any of the compatible database drivers. Database-only visibility APM's service maps feature includes the ability to opt out of the deeper, host and instance level view. However, to view databases in service maps without the instance-level details, you must still meet the same minimum agent versions as the Database and slow queries features. Create maps The APM service maps feature helps you create your first map by providing default map or architecture suggestions that automatically build a default map (if you have more than ten reporting apps). To view these suggested maps, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service Maps > Suggested maps. To create a new map: Do one of the following: Start from scratch: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Create new map . Copy an existing map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > Save as new. Name your map. Rearrange, group, or add nodes on the map as needed. Important Previously, you could have private service maps. Now, all users can view, edit, and delete all existing or new service maps in the account. Save and rename maps Here are some tips about saving and renaming maps: Save To save changes to a map, select Save. To create a copy of the current map, select Save as new. Rename To rename a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the pencil icon next to the map name. Change the name, then select Save. Add or remove nodes on maps After you create or save a map, build out your map by adding nodes to it. Nodes are added to the map differently based on the node type. To remove any node from the map, mouse over the node, then select the remove X icon. Applications and mobile apps Nodes for applications or mobile apps need to be added to the map in order to add any other nodes. Nodes are added and connected into the map as you select them. The check mark icon means that node is already on the map. To add New Relic monitored apps or plugins to maps: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. Select any applications from the App/Service list. Rearrange or group together as needed. Browser, databases, external services, connected apps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. To add browser apps, databases, external services, or other connected apps to the map: Select an incoming or outgoing connection widget. From the list of connections, mouse over an app or service, then select the plus icon. Rearrange as needed. Custom nodes To add a custom node to the map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. From the App/Service list, select Create custom node. Name the node.

Select the map name's pencil icon. Select Delete map. Identify issues with external services If your app connects to an external service that New Relic does not monitor (for example, a third-party API), New Relic watches the service for a week in order to baseline its response time. If New Relic can collect a statistically significant number of data points (more than 100), New Relic compares the current response time to this baseline and uses this to set the health status indicator: Green: Response time from the service is less than 1.75 times the baseline. Yellow: Response time from the service is longer than 1.75 times the baseline. Red: Response time from the service is longer than 2.5 times the baseline. Gray: Alerts concluded it does not have enough data to determine the health status. Purple: Alerts cannot yet conclude if it has enough data to determine the health status. Visualize and monitor complex architectures Use service maps to visualize and monitor complex architectures. For a tutorial introducing the latest features, select the service map's question icon. Nodes Nodes are the basic building blocks for your map. You can add a variety of node types including: Node type Description New Relic APM-monitored app Add your app to the map to view their connections to databases, browser apps, out-of-process services, and other instrumented apps. (In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are also referred to as web external or background external data.) Browser apps Automatically detected for each app and added via the incoming connections widget. Only displays browser apps linked to an APM app (standalone browser apps are not supported). New Relic mobile monitoring apps Automatically detected and added via the app/service list panel. Plugins, including Databases Automatically detected for each app and added via the connections widget. Databases in service maps require the same agent versions as the new Database page features. External services Service maps automatically detects external services (visible in the connections widget), to track your app's external dependencies and monitor the health of those connections. Custom nodes Add custom nodes via the app/service list panel to include apps and services not automatically instrumented by New Relic (for example, load balancers, implementation planning, and so on). Group nodes A group node contains multiple other nodes. For apps, group nodes include a summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. Node arrangement and grouping Click and drag a node to move it around the map, for a customizable view of your architecture. App nodes can also be grouped together into a single node to better organize related apps and services. Grouped nodes include summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. To remove items from a group, mouse over the group and select the pencil pencil icon, then select the minus minus-circle icon to remove the item from the group. Incoming and outgoing connections Service maps automatically detects incoming and outgoing connections based on HTTP calls between entities. Mouse over a node to highlight the node's connections. Widgets at the end of each node display a count of that node's connections, and you can click on those widgets to add related entities to the map: View performance summary Click on an app to view its performance over the last 30 minutes. The chart defaults to Response time, but you can view other metrics by selecting any of the available Apdex, Throughput, or Error rate links. While charts use the last 30 minutes of performance data, the service map as a whole is based on the last five minutes. View the app in APM or browser and view its labels by selecting the overflow ellipsis-v icon. Click the app name again to hide the summary charts, and select the overflow ellipsis-h icon again to hide other details. Map list and app/service list panels Select the Map list panel to: Search for and view your maps, and access other users' shared maps. Create a new map. Select the App/Service List panel to: Add new apps, mobile apps, and plugins to your map. Create custom nodes and add them to the map. Health status and performance metrics You can see health status indicators for most nodes. Except for out-of-process services (external services or background services), entities use the health status indicators used by New Relic Alerts. For out-of-process (external) services, the health status indicator measures the health of the connection to the external service. View all connected apps and services The Discover your environment feature allows you to view all of your apps, services, and dependencies together with a single click. This feature detects all connected applications and services (including externals and databases) to give you a comprehensive view of your overall software architecture environment. To view all connected apps and services: In APM, select Service maps. From your Map list, select Discover your environment to display all of your nodes. Hover over any node to view its dependencies and how it connects to other parts of your service map. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view their details. The Discover your environment feature may not be available if you are using an older New Relic agent version. See Troubleshooting cross application tracing for version information. This feature may also not be available for highly complex service maps with many elements. Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Discover your environment: Use this option to view all of your nodes and their dependencies in one place. Traffic light mode Traffic light mode lets you view the health status of your entire architecture at a glance. This feature helps you quickly find service and app problems, even within a complex environment with many nodes. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Traffic light mode. When traffic lights mode is On, zooming out far enough on a service map eventually causes the nodes to switch from displaying textual information, to only health status colors. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view more details. Traffic light mode is on by default. When traffic lights mode is Off, service map nodes retain their textual information and do not switch to health status colors, No matter how far you zoom out. one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Views > Traffic light mode: When traffic light mode is enabled, zooming out of your service map displays nodes in health status colors. Midnight mode Midnight mode inverts the screen's colors, going from a white background to a dark background. Midnight mode reduces eye strain, especially in low light environments. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Midnight mode.",

Examine code-level transaction traces. Examine database query traces. Examine error traces. Use thread profiler sessions to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads Other helpful tools include: Tools Description Browser monitoring Integrate the Python agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user browser activity. Simple scripts and background tasks Monitor job-based or task queuing systems, like Celery, or other standalone non-web functions. Business data analysis with data exploration. Use the Python agent with our data explorer to organize, query, and visualize your data to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience. Use default transaction attributes, or add your own. Query your data using the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). Send your own event data. Create and share customizable, interactive dashboards. Install the Python agent Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the system requirements. You must also create a New Relic account. We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the supported web frameworks, installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files. For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps: Download and install the Python package. Create config file. Integrate the Python agent with your application. Read the Quick Start guide Add Python data Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the install instructions, you would manually \"wrap\" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see Non-web tasks and processes. For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see Celery background tasks. What's next after installation? Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are: Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface. Read some documentation about Full-Stack Observability. For example, read about the capabilities of Full-Stack observability and the APM page. Change your application's name, or other configuration options. Learn about setting up custom instrumentation for application activity not monitored by default. Consider these open source telemetry tools: OpenCensus exporter and Python Telemetry SDK. Troubleshooting After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the APM UI within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources: If no data appears, follow these troubleshooting steps. If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, test that the package is installed correctly and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service. For other problems, see the full list of troubleshooting documentation. Check the source code The Python agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

It also forwards data from infrastructure integrations to New Relic, as well as log data for log analytics. There are multiple ways to install and deploy the infrastructure monitoring agent, depending on your setup and needs. This document describes how the infrastructure monitoring agent works and how to install it. Tip To use infrastructure monitoring and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Quick start: Use our guided install The quickest way to get started with our infrastructure monitoring agent is through our guided install. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install not only installs the infrastructure agent, but also discovers the applications and log sources running in your environment. It recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your infrastructure. Important If you install the agent using the New Relic One UI, the Infrastructure status API is enabled by default. One agent, many capabilities Our infrastructure monitoring agent collects performance and health data about the system resources and processes of the host where it's enabled (on-premises or virtualized). At the same time, it acts as a forwarder for two types of data: core services metrics, which are collected by on-host integrations, and logs. If you want to collect data about core services running on your host, you need to install the infrastructure monitoring agent first, and then install or enable on-host integrations. Our infrastructure monitoring agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services. It can also forward logs to New Relic. Backend application metrics (APM) are collected by separate language agents. Notice how each integration and forwarder feed different data types in the New Relic database (NRDB). Install the infrastructure monitoring agent If our guided install doesn't work for your setup, follow the instructions for your Linux, Windows, or other setup. The infrastructure monitoring agent can currently run on many Linux distributions, as well as Windows Server. For more information on where you can run the agent, check the compatibility and requirements page. Linux The preferred way to install the Linux agent is through the package manager of your distribution. Select your distribution from the list for step-by-step instructions. Amazon Linux CentOS Container (Docker) Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Other Linux distros To use these installation links, you must be logged to your New Relic account. If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or if you prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced install needs, you can deploy the agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual mode. Windows Server and 10 To deploy the agent on a Windows Server host, install it using our MSI installer. For a guided procedure, click the button below and follow the step-by-step instructions: Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced installation needs, you can deploy the agent using our zip files in assisted or manual mode. Other installation scenarios The infrastructure monitoring agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Check the source code The infrastructure monitoring agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.

This guide covers: Downloading the New Relic One CLI to build or modify apps Contribute content to this website Before you begin Before you begin, we recommend first reading about permissions. To start building, you must have: A github account account - While not strictly necessary for building apps, a GitHub account enables you to download and customize our open source apps, and contribute an open source project. A New Relic developer account - if you don't already have one, you can get a free trial account for developing New Relic applications. npm - If you've installed Node.js, then you already have npm, which is used to share, reuse, and update JavaScript code, and is necessary for working with React components that are the framework for New Relic apps and this website. A note on support Building a New Relic One application is the same as building any JavaScript/React application. We offer support to help with our building tools (our CLI and SDK library). However, we don't offer support for basic JavaScript or React coding questions or issues. For common questions and answers about building, see the Explorers Hub page on building on New Relic One. Tip Use the New Relic One VSCode extension or the New Relic VSCode extension pack to build your apps. Prepare to build or modify apps Step 1 of 1 Download the CLI and API key. On the Build New Relic One applications page, complete the Quick start steps. These six Quick start steps get you an API key for use with developing apps, and the New Relic One CLI, for building and deploying apps. At the end of the Quick start, you have a project consisting of the following: A Nerdpack - The package containing all the files required by your application. It contains two types of files that you customize to build your app: Nerdlets, and the launcher. One or more Nerdlet files - A specific UI view or window. A Nerdlet is a React JavaScript package that includes an index.js file, a stylesheet, and a JSON-format config file. It can contain any JS functionality (charts, interactive fields, tooltips, etc.). A launcher file: This is the basis for the launcher, which is used to open your application from New Relic One after you publish your app. Start building Step 1 of 1 If you're ready to code, cd to your Nerdpack and get started. If you want to learn more about building applications, try these step-by-step guides: Build a \"Hello, World!\" application shows how to create a little application, publish it to New Relic One, and share it with others by subscribing accounts to it. Map pageviews by region takes you through the steps to create one of our popular open source apps. You learn to add a custom query to an app and view it in a table, then add that data to a map. Contribute to developer.newrelic.com This site is open source, and we want your input. Create a pull request if you see a mistake you know how to fix. Drop us a GitHub issue if you see some content gaps you want us to work on. Or write up a whole new guide if you have one you'd like to share. Read on to learn how. Step 1 of 3 Fork the developer-website GithHub repo. Forking the repo enables you to work on your own copy of the developer.newrelic.com files, and build the site locally. It also enables us to more easily manage incomimg pull requests. On the developer-website page in GitHub, select the Fork button on the top right of the page, choose the account you want to fork to, and wait a few seconds while the fork is created. Sync regularly to keep your fork up to date with changes and additions to the main branch upstream. Step 2 of 3 Make a feature or documentation request. On any page, select the GitHub button at the top of the page, and then select the kind of change you want, and fill out the GitHub form. Step 3 of 3 Contribute a new guide.

By default, only single-origin requests are monitored unless cross-origin resource sharing is enabled. Make sure you have the necessary minimum versions for your browser and APM agents: Browser Pro + SPA, with distributed tracing enabled Browser agent version 1153 or higher Browser agent version 1158 or higher (required for cross-origin resource sharing) Browser agent version 1173 or higher (required for w3c trace context support) APM agent version: C SDK 1.3 or higher Java 5.9.0 or higher PHP 9.4.0 or higher Other APM agent version requirements Enable distributed tracing To enable distributed tracing for browser monitoring: Make sure you meet requirements, including having: Full-Stack Observability Browser Pro with SPA enabled Go to one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle. By default, for agent version 1173 and above, the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers will be added to all same-origin AJAX requests. Optional: If all of your services are configured to use the w3c trace context headers, you can choose to exclude the newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate headers from requests. Optional: Enable cross-origin resource sharing. Redeploy the Browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste browser installation). Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) If you have AJAX requests that need resources from different origins, you can enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). By default, distributed tracing for cross-origin requests is not enabled because of browser CORS security restrictions: Distributed tracing is implemented by adding a custom HTTP headers (newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate) to outgoing AJAX requests, and browsers typically do not allow custom headers on cross-origin requests. With the release of agent version 1173, we now support the w3c trace context headers (traceparent and tracestate) so these should also be allowed in your configuration. There are two separate configurations required to enable cross-origin distributed tracing: Configure the service on the different origin to accept the newrelic custom header Configure browser monitoring to include the target origin in distributed tracing Our step-by-step instructions provide key concepts and steps to enable this feature, but if you need more background about how cross-origin resource sharing works, we recommend this Mozilla developer document. Risks and mitigations Caution Cross-origin resource sharing can expose you to a high level of risk if the services on the different origins are not configured correctly. The AJAX requests will likely return an error, resulting in a variety of failures, including: Resources failing to load (for example, images and key content) Login failures Entire site outages (depending on type of requests enabled) By enabling this cross-origin resource sharing feature, you are acknowledging the following: You understand that this feature is optional and not mandatory. You understand the steps you need to take in order to enable this feature for your services and your domains. You understand that if you do not properly configure your services prior to deployment (including but not limited to configuring your services on your domains to accept custom headers) portions or all of your website will likely malfunction. You understand that New Relic is neither responsible nor liable for errors or issues related to your misconfiguration of servers or services. You fully and solely accept the risks and wish to proceed. The best way to minimize your risk is to ensure you fully understand the process and to try it first in a test environment. Before reading the step-by-step instructions, it may help to first read this overview of the process: To use distributed tracing with cross-origin resources, you populate a list of approved cross-origin resources in New Relic, and then we automatically send the following custom headers to those resources: newrelic, traceparent, and tracestate. For this process to work, you must first ensure that someone has configured the services on the other origins to accept this custom header. Cross-origin resource sharing uses a variety of HTTP headers (both in the request and response). The header that specifically applies to New Relic is the Access-Control-Allow-Headers response header, which can include newrelic, traceparent, tracestate, or newrelic, traceparent, tracestate in its value depending on what tracing strategies you enabled in your APM-monitored application. You must configure your server to return this CORS header in its response. Example: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate Important New Relic cannot perform any validation to ensure the services on the other origins were configured correctly. If you're unsure about how to allow these headers, do not add cross-origin resources to the approved list in the New Relic UI. Enable cross-origin resource sharing Caution You should always try enabling CORS in a test environment before setting it up in production. To enable cross-origin resource sharing: Confirm that the services on the other origins are configured to accept the newrelic header using: Access-Control-Allow-Headers: newrelic, traceparent, tracestate (for details, see Risks and mitigations). Confirm that you meet the Browser monitoring requirements. Make sure you are in one.newrelic.com, and click Browser > (select an app) > Application settings. Turn on the Distributed tracing toggle if it's not already enabled. Turn on the Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) toggle. Under Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), add cross-origin resources to the approved list. Important Valid cross-origin resources must include: The prefix http:// or https:// The domain name The port number is not required unless it differs from the default for HTTP (port 80) or HTTPS (port 443). Select Save application settings to update the agent configuration. Redeploy the browser agent (either restarting the associated APM agent or updating the copy/paste browser installation). Find data Tips for finding and querying data: You can find end-user-originating traces in any New Relic One distributed tracing UI. In the distributed tracing UI, end-user spans are indicated with the icon. To see a span's attributes, select a span in the UI. Spans are reported as Span data, and can be queried in New Relic. Query tips: Query by browser app name by setting browserApp.name to the browser app name. Query for traces containing at least one browser app span with browserApp.name is not null. Query for traces containing at least one back-end app with appName is not null. Query for traces containing both browser and back-end spans by combining the two previous conditions. Troubleshooting If you don't see end-user spans, or are having other distributed tracing issues, see Troubleshooting.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing tracks and observes service requests as they flow through distributed systems. With distributed tracing data, you can quickly pinpoint failures or performance issues and fix them. Distributed tracing systems collect data as the requests go from one service to another, recording each segment of the journey as a span. These spans contain important details about each segment of the request and are combined into one trace. The completed trace gives you a picture of the entire request. Here is an example a web transaction where agents measure the time spent in each service. Agents then send that timing information to New Relic as spans where they are combined into one distributed trace. Why it matters A request might pass through various microservices to reach completion. The microservices or functions could be located in multiple containers, serverless environments, virtual machines, different cloud providers, on-premises, or any combination of these. For example, let's say that you're in a situation where a slow-running request affects the experience of a set of customers: The request is distributed across multiple microservices and serverless functions. Several different teams own and monitor the various services that are involved in the request. None of the teams have reported any performance issues with their microservices. Without a way to view the performance of the entire request across the different services, it’s nearly impossible to pinpoint where and why the high latency is occurring and which team should address the issue. Instrumentation: The key to distributed tracing Distributed tracing starts with the instrumentation of your services to enable data collection and correlation across the entire distributed system. Instrumention means either manually adding code to services or installing agents that automatically track trace data. Many of our New Relic solutions automatically instrument your services for a large number of programming languages and frameworks. You can also use open source tools and open instrumentation standards to instrument your environment. OpenTelemetry, part of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), is becoming the one standard for open source instrumentation and telemetry collection. What you can see in the New Relic UI After the data is collected, you can visualize it to see service dependencies, performance, and any anomalous events such as errors or unusual latency. Here are some examples of what you can do with your data: What you can do Description Detect anomalous spans Spans that are slow in comparison to typical behavior are marked as anomalous, with charts comparing them to typical performance. See your errors and logs Frontend and backend errors appear right in the context of your traces. Everything you need to troubleshoot is in one place. Filter results You can filter charts using many data points, so you can analyze trace data in different ways. Customize queries and dashboards You can create custom queries of your trace data and create custom data dashboards. See data across accounts See a global view of traces from across all your accounts and applications in New Relic One.

      "body": "Problem You have enabled distributed tracing but data you expected to see does not appear in New Relic's distributed tracing UI. Solution Important Before performing troubleshooting, we recommend reading How distributed tracing works. Here are some causes and solutions when you have problems finding expected data in the distributed tracing UI: Problems with enabling or instrumenting Missing spans due to service not having distributed tracing enabled In order for distributed tracing to report details for all nodes in a trace, each application must be monitored by a New Relic agent that has had distributed tracing enabled. If an application's New Relic account has not had distributed tracing enabled, it will have these issues: Its distributed tracing UI page won't have data. It won't report data to other accounts' distributed traces. Missing apps/services may require manual instrumentation When you enable distributed tracing for applications and services that New Relic automatically instruments, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some services or applications are missing from traces, or that there are some internal spans you expect to see that are missing. If that's the case, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the New Relic agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the New Relic agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application. Problems with spans Infinite Tracing: missing spans If your APM agent can’t write data fast enough to the trace observer, queue_size is an additional APM agent configuration to limit the number of spans the agent will hold. See the following examples for your agent: .NET configuration method Example Configuration file <configuration . . . > <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer> <span_events queue_size=\"100000\" /> </trace_observer> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy Environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_EVENTS_QUEUE_SIZE=100000 Copy Python configuration method Example Configuration file infinite_tracing.span_queue_size = 100000 Environment Variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000 Missing span not getting exported Sometimes header propagation is successful, but the span information isn't getting sent to New Relic. For example, if OpenTelemetry is not instrumented with a New Relic exporter, the span details never make it to New Relic. In this diagram, notice that the header propagation is successful, but no exporter is set up in Service 2 to send the span to New Relic: The following diagram also shows successful header propagation, but it includes an exporter in Service 2 that sends the span details to New Relic (see Trace API): Missing spans due to sampling process Standard distributed tracing for APM uses adaptive sampling. This means that a percentage of calls to a service will be reported as part of a distributed trace. Specific calls to your service might not have been selected to be sampled. Missing spans due to span limits maxed out There are limits on the number of spans that can be collected and displayed. If an application generates a very large number of spans for a single call, it might exceed the APM agent's span-collection limit for that harvest cycle. This could result in missing spans and significantly limit the number of traces the agent can completely sample and report. We currently only show 10,000 spans at a time. Missing spans due to spans being sent late Spans must be sent within the last twenty minutes to be captured in a trace index. If you send any spans older than twenty minutes but newer than a day, the span data will still be written. However, it won't be rolled into the trace index, which controls the trace list in the distributed tracing UI. If a span has a timestamp older than a day, it will be dropped. This often occurs when there is clock skew (timing differences) between systems or long running background jobs. Problems with trace details Middleware doesn't recognize proprietary New Relic header If your transactions are only sending the proprietary New Relic header, some middleware might not recognize the format and then drop the information as shown in this diagram: One solution is to upgrade your New Relic agent to a version that supports W3C trace context. In the diagram below, the W3C-compliant New Relic agent passes the prior header along with two standardized headers: An intermediary is missing or isn't passing trace context Some potential problems with proxies and other intermediaries: Incomplete trace. Some intermediaries won't automatically propagate the distributed tracing header. In that case, you must configure that component to allow the header to be passed from source to destination. For instructions, consult the documentation for that intermediary component. Missing intermediary in trace. If the intermediary is New Relic-monitored, ensure that it propagates the newrelic header that is generated or updated by the New Relic agent running on that intermediary. This may manifest when an intermediary was previously visible in traces, but disappeared after distributed tracing was enabled for an upstream entity (for example, a browser-monitored application). Tip If some entities report trace data to another tracing system, you can use the trace ID from the New Relic UI to search other tracing systems for missing spans. Stitching together spans from mixed sources If each agent in a chain supports W3C Trace Context, then we can stitch the spans together into a complete trace. If part of the chain is from an agent, such as Zipkin, which doesn't support W3C Trace Context, then spans coming from that agent may not be included in the trace. Trace details are obfuscated If a trace contains data from applications monitored by multiple New Relic accounts, and your user permissions don't allow you to access those accounts, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. For example, you may see a series of asterisks ( * * * * * ) instead of the service name in your distributed tracing list if you don't have access to the account linked with the service. Trace list information and trace details don't match The trace list is generated by trace indexes, which are captured in a twenty minute window from when the first spans are received. Usually, this is due to late spans. Long traces with short backend times If you're seeing unusually short backend times for long traces, this is likely an issue with the timestamps being sent. For example, the root span might be reposting microseconds as milliseconds. This can also happen if the root span is a browser application. When using an external client like a web browser, you may experience clock skew (timing differences) more often. Problems with browser applications Missing spans and transactions after enabling for a browser application Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If the browser application makes an AJAX request to an APM application running an incompatible agent, then the APM agent may not record transaction and span data for that request. If distributed tracing is enabled for a browser application and you are not seeing transaction or span data for downstream APM requests, review the browser data in distributed tracing requirements, and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. Not seeing browser app end-user spans If traces seem to be missing end-user spans, be sure you've read and understand the browser distributed tracing requirements and enable procedures. On the AJAX UI page, there are links to the distributed tracing UI regardless of whether there are end-user spans present in that trace. For details about what data generates spans, see Requirements. Browser spans are not connected to other spans Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If APM spans are missing consistently from traces that include browser applications, please refer to the browser data in distributed tracing requirements and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. For other causes of orphaned browser spans, see Browser span reporting. Other problems Search by entity.name not finding associated app names Potential cause: For applications that have multiple app names, the entity.name attribute will be associated only with the primary app name.

Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in mobile, browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Problem You have enabled distributed tracing but data you expected to see does not appear in New Relic's distributed tracing UI. Solution Important Before performing troubleshooting, we recommend reading How distributed tracing works. Here are some causes and solutions when you have problems finding expected data in the distributed tracing UI: Problems with enabling or instrumenting Missing spans due to service not having distributed tracing enabled In order for distributed tracing to report details for all nodes in a trace, each application must be monitored by a New Relic agent that has had distributed tracing enabled. If an application's New Relic account has not had distributed tracing enabled, it will have these issues: Its distributed tracing UI page won't have data. It won't report data to other accounts' distributed traces. Missing apps/services may require manual instrumentation When you enable distributed tracing for applications and services that New Relic automatically instruments, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some services or applications are missing from traces, or that there are some internal spans you expect to see that are missing. If that's the case, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the New Relic agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the New Relic agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application. Problems with spans Infinite Tracing: missing spans If your APM agent can’t write data fast enough to the trace observer, queue_size is an additional APM agent configuration to limit the number of spans the agent will hold. See the following examples for your agent: .NET configuration method Example Configuration file <configuration . . . > <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer> <span_events queue_size=\"100000\" /> </trace_observer> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy Environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_EVENTS_QUEUE_SIZE=100000 Copy Python configuration method Example Configuration file infinite_tracing.span_queue_size = 100000 Environment Variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000 Missing span not getting exported Sometimes header propagation is successful, but the span information isn't getting sent to New Relic. For example, if OpenTelemetry is not instrumented with a New Relic exporter, the span details never make it to New Relic. In this diagram, notice that the header propagation is successful, but no exporter is set up in Service 2 to send the span to New Relic: The following diagram also shows successful header propagation, but it includes an exporter in Service 2 that sends the span details to New Relic (see Trace API): Missing spans due to sampling process Standard distributed tracing for APM uses adaptive sampling. This means that a percentage of calls to a service will be reported as part of a distributed trace. Specific calls to your service might not have been selected to be sampled. Missing spans due to span limits maxed out There are limits on the number of spans that can be collected and displayed. If an application generates a very large number of spans for a single call, it might exceed the APM agent's span-collection limit for that harvest cycle. This could result in missing spans and significantly limit the number of traces the agent can completely sample and report. We currently only show 10,000 spans at a time. Missing spans due to spans being sent late Spans must be sent within the last twenty minutes to be captured in a trace index. If you send any spans older than twenty minutes but newer than a day, the span data will still be written. However, it won't be rolled into the trace index, which controls the trace list in the distributed tracing UI. If a span has a timestamp older than a day, it will be dropped. This often occurs when there is clock skew (timing differences) between systems or long running background jobs. Problems with trace details Middleware doesn't recognize proprietary New Relic header If your transactions are only sending the proprietary New Relic header, some middleware might not recognize the format and then drop the information as shown in this diagram: One solution is to upgrade your New Relic agent to a version that supports W3C trace context. In the diagram below, the W3C-compliant New Relic agent passes the prior header along with two standardized headers: An intermediary is missing or isn't passing trace context Some potential problems with proxies and other intermediaries: Incomplete trace. Some intermediaries won't automatically propagate the distributed tracing header. In that case, you must configure that component to allow the header to be passed from source to destination. For instructions, consult the documentation for that intermediary component. Missing intermediary in trace. If the intermediary is New Relic-monitored, ensure that it propagates the newrelic header that is generated or updated by the New Relic agent running on that intermediary. This may manifest when an intermediary was previously visible in traces, but disappeared after distributed tracing was enabled for an upstream entity (for example, a browser-monitored application). Tip If some entities report trace data to another tracing system, you can use the trace ID from the New Relic UI to search other tracing systems for missing spans. Stitching together spans from mixed sources If each agent in a chain supports W3C Trace Context, then we can stitch the spans together into a complete trace. If part of the chain is from an agent, such as Zipkin, which doesn't support W3C Trace Context, then spans coming from that agent may not be included in the trace. Trace details are obfuscated If a trace contains data from applications monitored by multiple New Relic accounts, and your user permissions don't allow you to access those accounts, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. For example, you may see a series of asterisks ( * * * * * ) instead of the service name in your distributed tracing list if you don't have access to the account linked with the service. Trace list information and trace details don't match The trace list is generated by trace indexes, which are captured in a twenty minute window from when the first spans are received. Usually, this is due to late spans. Long traces with short backend times If you're seeing unusually short backend times for long traces, this is likely an issue with the timestamps being sent. For example, the root span might be reposting microseconds as milliseconds. This can also happen if the root span is a browser application. When using an external client like a web browser, you may experience clock skew (timing differences) more often. Problems with browser applications Missing spans and transactions after enabling for a browser application Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If the browser application makes an AJAX request to an APM application running an incompatible agent, then the APM agent may not record transaction and span data for that request. If distributed tracing is enabled for a browser application and you are not seeing transaction or span data for downstream APM requests, review the browser data in distributed tracing requirements, and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. Not seeing browser app end-user spans If traces seem to be missing end-user spans, be sure you've read and understand the browser distributed tracing requirements and enable procedures. On the AJAX UI page, there are links to the distributed tracing UI regardless of whether there are end-user spans present in that trace. For details about what data generates spans, see Requirements. Browser spans are not connected to other spans Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If APM spans are missing consistently from traces that include browser applications, please refer to the browser data in distributed tracing requirements and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. For other causes of orphaned browser spans, see Browser span reporting.

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in mobile, browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Problem You have enabled distributed tracing but data you expected to see does not appear in New Relic's distributed tracing UI. Solution Important Before performing troubleshooting, we recommend reading How distributed tracing works. Here are some causes and solutions when you have problems finding expected data in the distributed tracing UI: Problems with enabling or instrumenting Missing spans due to service not having distributed tracing enabled In order for distributed tracing to report details for all nodes in a trace, each application must be monitored by a New Relic agent that has had distributed tracing enabled. If an application's New Relic account has not had distributed tracing enabled, it will have these issues: Its distributed tracing UI page won't have data. It won't report data to other accounts' distributed traces. Missing apps/services may require manual instrumentation When you enable distributed tracing for applications and services that New Relic automatically instruments, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some services or applications are missing from traces, or that there are some internal spans you expect to see that are missing. If that's the case, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the New Relic agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the New Relic agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application. Problems with spans Infinite Tracing: missing spans If your APM agent can’t write data fast enough to the trace observer, queue_size is an additional APM agent configuration to limit the number of spans the agent will hold. See the following examples for your agent: .NET configuration method Example Configuration file <configuration . . . > <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer> <span_events queue_size=\"100000\" /> </trace_observer> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy Environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_EVENTS_QUEUE_SIZE=100000 Copy Python configuration method Example Configuration file infinite_tracing.span_queue_size = 100000 Environment Variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000 Missing span not getting exported Sometimes header propagation is successful, but the span information isn't getting sent to New Relic. For example, if OpenTelemetry is not instrumented with a New Relic exporter, the span details never make it to New Relic. In this diagram, notice that the header propagation is successful, but no exporter is set up in Service 2 to send the span to New Relic: The following diagram also shows successful header propagation, but it includes an exporter in Service 2 that sends the span details to New Relic (see Trace API): Missing spans due to sampling process Standard distributed tracing for APM uses adaptive sampling. This means that a percentage of calls to a service will be reported as part of a distributed trace. Specific calls to your service might not have been selected to be sampled. Missing spans due to span limits maxed out There are limits on the number of spans that can be collected and displayed. If an application generates a very large number of spans for a single call, it might exceed the APM agent's span-collection limit for that harvest cycle. This could result in missing spans and significantly limit the number of traces the agent can completely sample and report. We currently only show 10,000 spans at a time. Missing spans due to spans being sent late Spans must be sent within the last twenty minutes to be captured in a trace index. If you send any spans older than twenty minutes but newer than a day, the span data will still be written. However, it won't be rolled into the trace index, which controls the trace list in the distributed tracing UI. If a span has a timestamp older than a day, it will be dropped. This often occurs when there is clock skew (timing differences) between systems or long running background jobs. Problems with trace details Middleware doesn't recognize proprietary New Relic header If your transactions are only sending the proprietary New Relic header, some middleware might not recognize the format and then drop the information as shown in this diagram: One solution is to upgrade your New Relic agent to a version that supports W3C trace context. In the diagram below, the W3C-compliant New Relic agent passes the prior header along with two standardized headers: An intermediary is missing or isn't passing trace context Some potential problems with proxies and other intermediaries: Incomplete trace. Some intermediaries won't automatically propagate the distributed tracing header. In that case, you must configure that component to allow the header to be passed from source to destination. For instructions, consult the documentation for that intermediary component. Missing intermediary in trace. If the intermediary is New Relic-monitored, ensure that it propagates the newrelic header that is generated or updated by the New Relic agent running on that intermediary. This may manifest when an intermediary was previously visible in traces, but disappeared after distributed tracing was enabled for an upstream entity (for example, a browser-monitored application). Tip If some entities report trace data to another tracing system, you can use the trace ID from the New Relic UI to search other tracing systems for missing spans. Stitching together spans from mixed sources If each agent in a chain supports W3C Trace Context, then we can stitch the spans together into a complete trace. If part of the chain is from an agent, such as Zipkin, which doesn't support W3C Trace Context, then spans coming from that agent may not be included in the trace. Trace details are obfuscated If a trace contains data from applications monitored by multiple New Relic accounts, and your user permissions don't allow you to access those accounts, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. For example, you may see a series of asterisks ( * * * * * ) instead of the service name in your distributed tracing list if you don't have access to the account linked with the service. Trace list information and trace details don't match The trace list is generated by trace indexes, which are captured in a twenty minute window from when the first spans are received. Usually, this is due to late spans. Long traces with short backend times If you're seeing unusually short backend times for long traces, this is likely an issue with the timestamps being sent. For example, the root span might be reposting microseconds as milliseconds. This can also happen if the root span is a browser application. When using an external client like a web browser, you may experience clock skew (timing differences) more often. Problems with browser applications Missing spans and transactions after enabling for a browser application Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If the browser application makes an AJAX request to an APM application running an incompatible agent, then the APM agent may not record transaction and span data for that request. If distributed tracing is enabled for a browser application and you are not seeing transaction or span data for downstream APM requests, review the browser data in distributed tracing requirements, and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. Not seeing browser app end-user spans If traces seem to be missing end-user spans, be sure you've read and understand the browser distributed tracing requirements and enable procedures. On the AJAX UI page, there are links to the distributed tracing UI regardless of whether there are end-user spans present in that trace. For details about what data generates spans, see Requirements. Browser spans are not connected to other spans Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If APM spans are missing consistently from traces that include browser applications, please refer to the browser data in distributed tracing requirements and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. For other causes of orphaned browser spans, see Browser span reporting. Other problems Search by entity.name not finding associated app names Potential cause: For applications that have multiple app names, the entity.name attribute will be associated only with the primary app name. To search by other app names, search using the appName attribute. Supporting OpenTelemetry Questions about integrating with OpenTelemetry should be taken to the Explorers Hub.",

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in mobile, browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Problem You have enabled distributed tracing but data you expected to see does not appear in New Relic's distributed tracing UI. Solution Important Before performing troubleshooting, we recommend reading How distributed tracing works. Here are some causes and solutions when you have problems finding expected data in the distributed tracing UI: Problems with enabling or instrumenting Missing spans due to service not having distributed tracing enabled In order for distributed tracing to report details for all nodes in a trace, each application must be monitored by a New Relic agent that has had distributed tracing enabled. If an application's New Relic account has not had distributed tracing enabled, it will have these issues: Its distributed tracing UI page won't have data. It won't report data to other accounts' distributed traces. Missing apps/services may require manual instrumentation When you enable distributed tracing for applications and services that New Relic automatically instruments, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some services or applications are missing from traces, or that there are some internal spans you expect to see that are missing. If that's the case, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the New Relic agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the New Relic agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application. Problems with spans Infinite Tracing: missing spans If your APM agent can’t write data fast enough to the trace observer, queue_size is an additional APM agent configuration to limit the number of spans the agent will hold. See the following examples for your agent: .NET configuration method Example Configuration file <configuration . . . > <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer> <span_events queue_size=\"100000\" /> </trace_observer> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy Environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_EVENTS_QUEUE_SIZE=100000 Copy Python configuration method Example Configuration file infinite_tracing.span_queue_size = 100000 Environment Variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000 Missing span not getting exported Sometimes header propagation is successful, but the span information isn't getting sent to New Relic. For example, if OpenTelemetry is not instrumented with a New Relic exporter, the span details never make it to New Relic. In this diagram, notice that the header propagation is successful, but no exporter is set up in Service 2 to send the span to New Relic: The following diagram also shows successful header propagation, but it includes an exporter in Service 2 that sends the span details to New Relic (see Trace API): Missing spans due to sampling process Standard distributed tracing for APM uses adaptive sampling. This means that a percentage of calls to a service will be reported as part of a distributed trace. Specific calls to your service might not have been selected to be sampled. Missing spans due to span limits maxed out There are limits on the number of spans that can be collected and displayed. If an application generates a very large number of spans for a single call, it might exceed the APM agent's span-collection limit for that harvest cycle. This could result in missing spans and significantly limit the number of traces the agent can completely sample and report. We currently only show 10,000 spans at a time. Missing spans due to spans being sent late Spans must be sent within the last twenty minutes to be captured in a trace index. If you send any spans older than twenty minutes but newer than a day, the span data will still be written. However, it won't be rolled into the trace index, which controls the trace list in the distributed tracing UI. If a span has a timestamp older than a day, it will be dropped. This often occurs when there is clock skew (timing differences) between systems or long running background jobs. Problems with trace details Middleware doesn't recognize proprietary New Relic header If your transactions are only sending the proprietary New Relic header, some middleware might not recognize the format and then drop the information as shown in this diagram: One solution is to upgrade your New Relic agent to a version that supports W3C trace context. In the diagram below, the W3C-compliant New Relic agent passes the prior header along with two standardized headers: An intermediary is missing or isn't passing trace context Some potential problems with proxies and other intermediaries: Incomplete trace. Some intermediaries won't automatically propagate the distributed tracing header. In that case, you must configure that component to allow the header to be passed from source to destination. For instructions, consult the documentation for that intermediary component. Missing intermediary in trace. If the intermediary is New Relic-monitored, ensure that it propagates the newrelic header that is generated or updated by the New Relic agent running on that intermediary. This may manifest when an intermediary was previously visible in traces, but disappeared after distributed tracing was enabled for an upstream entity (for example, a browser-monitored application). Tip If some entities report trace data to another tracing system, you can use the trace ID from the New Relic UI to search other tracing systems for missing spans. Stitching together spans from mixed sources If each agent in a chain supports W3C Trace Context, then we can stitch the spans together into a complete trace. If part of the chain is from an agent, such as Zipkin, which doesn't support W3C Trace Context, then spans coming from that agent may not be included in the trace. Trace details are obfuscated If a trace contains data from applications monitored by multiple New Relic accounts, and your user permissions don't allow you to access those accounts, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. For example, you may see a series of asterisks ( * * * * * ) instead of the service name in your distributed tracing list if you don't have access to the account linked with the service. Trace list information and trace details don't match The trace list is generated by trace indexes, which are captured in a twenty minute window from when the first spans are received. Usually, this is due to late spans. Long traces with short backend times If you're seeing unusually short backend times for long traces, this is likely an issue with the timestamps being sent. For example, the root span might be reposting microseconds as milliseconds. This can also happen if the root span is a browser application. When using an external client like a web browser, you may experience clock skew (timing differences) more often. Problems with browser applications Missing spans and transactions after enabling for a browser application Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If the browser application makes an AJAX request to an APM application running an incompatible agent, then the APM agent may not record transaction and span data for that request. If distributed tracing is enabled for a browser application and you are not seeing transaction or span data for downstream APM requests, review the browser data in distributed tracing requirements, and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. Not seeing browser app end-user spans If traces seem to be missing end-user spans, be sure you've read and understand the browser distributed tracing requirements and enable procedures. On the AJAX UI page, there are links to the distributed tracing UI regardless of whether there are end-user spans present in that trace. For details about what data generates spans, see Requirements. Browser spans are not connected to other spans Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If APM spans are missing consistently from traces that include browser applications, please refer to the browser data in distributed tracing requirements and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. For other causes of orphaned browser spans, see Browser span reporting. Other problems Search by entity.name not finding associated app names Potential cause: For applications that have multiple app names, the entity.name attribute will be associated only with the primary app name.

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in mobile, browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Problem You have enabled distributed tracing but data you expected to see does not appear in New Relic's distributed tracing UI. Solution Important Before performing troubleshooting, we recommend reading How distributed tracing works. Here are some causes and solutions when you have problems finding expected data in the distributed tracing UI: Problems with enabling or instrumenting Missing spans due to service not having distributed tracing enabled In order for distributed tracing to report details for all nodes in a trace, each application must be monitored by a New Relic agent that has had distributed tracing enabled. If an application's New Relic account has not had distributed tracing enabled, it will have these issues: Its distributed tracing UI page won't have data. It won't report data to other accounts' distributed traces. Missing apps/services may require manual instrumentation When you enable distributed tracing for applications and services that New Relic automatically instruments, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some services or applications are missing from traces, or that there are some internal spans you expect to see that are missing. If that's the case, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the New Relic agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the New Relic agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application. Problems with spans Infinite Tracing: missing spans If your APM agent can’t write data fast enough to the trace observer, queue_size is an additional APM agent configuration to limit the number of spans the agent will hold. See the following examples for your agent: .NET configuration method Example Configuration file <configuration . . . > <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer> <span_events queue_size=\"100000\" /> </trace_observer> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy Environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_EVENTS_QUEUE_SIZE=100000 Copy Python configuration method Example Configuration file infinite_tracing.span_queue_size = 100000 Environment Variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000 Missing span not getting exported Sometimes header propagation is successful, but the span information isn't getting sent to New Relic. For example, if OpenTelemetry is not instrumented with a New Relic exporter, the span details never make it to New Relic. In this diagram, notice that the header propagation is successful, but no exporter is set up in Service 2 to send the span to New Relic: The following diagram also shows successful header propagation, but it includes an exporter in Service 2 that sends the span details to New Relic (see Trace API): Missing spans due to sampling process Standard distributed tracing for APM uses adaptive sampling. This means that a percentage of calls to a service will be reported as part of a distributed trace. Specific calls to your service might not have been selected to be sampled. Missing spans due to span limits maxed out There are limits on the number of spans that can be collected and displayed. If an application generates a very large number of spans for a single call, it might exceed the APM agent's span-collection limit for that harvest cycle. This could result in missing spans and significantly limit the number of traces the agent can completely sample and report. We currently only show 10,000 spans at a time. Missing spans due to spans being sent late Spans must be sent within the last twenty minutes to be captured in a trace index. If you send any spans older than twenty minutes but newer than a day, the span data will still be written. However, it won't be rolled into the trace index, which controls the trace list in the distributed tracing UI. If a span has a timestamp older than a day, it will be dropped. This often occurs when there is clock skew (timing differences) between systems or long running background jobs. Problems with trace details Middleware doesn't recognize proprietary New Relic header If your transactions are only sending the proprietary New Relic header, some middleware might not recognize the format and then drop the information as shown in this diagram: One solution is to upgrade your New Relic agent to a version that supports W3C trace context. In the diagram below, the W3C-compliant New Relic agent passes the prior header along with two standardized headers: An intermediary is missing or isn't passing trace context Some potential problems with proxies and other intermediaries: Incomplete trace. Some intermediaries won't automatically propagate the distributed tracing header. In that case, you must configure that component to allow the header to be passed from source to destination. For instructions, consult the documentation for that intermediary component. Missing intermediary in trace. If the intermediary is New Relic-monitored, ensure that it propagates the newrelic header that is generated or updated by the New Relic agent running on that intermediary. This may manifest when an intermediary was previously visible in traces, but disappeared after distributed tracing was enabled for an upstream entity (for example, a browser-monitored application). Tip If some entities report trace data to another tracing system, you can use the trace ID from the New Relic UI to search other tracing systems for missing spans. Stitching together spans from mixed sources If each agent in a chain supports W3C Trace Context, then we can stitch the spans together into a complete trace. If part of the chain is from an agent, such as Zipkin, which doesn't support W3C Trace Context, then spans coming from that agent may not be included in the trace. Trace details are obfuscated If a trace contains data from applications monitored by multiple New Relic accounts, and your user permissions don't allow you to access those accounts, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. For example, you may see a series of asterisks ( * * * * * ) instead of the service name in your distributed tracing list if you don't have access to the account linked with the service. Trace list information and trace details don't match The trace list is generated by trace indexes, which are captured in a twenty minute window from when the first spans are received. Usually, this is due to late spans. Long traces with short backend times If you're seeing unusually short backend times for long traces, this is likely an issue with the timestamps being sent. For example, the root span might be reposting microseconds as milliseconds. This can also happen if the root span is a browser application. When using an external client like a web browser, you may experience clock skew (timing differences) more often. Problems with browser applications Missing spans and transactions after enabling for a browser application Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If the browser application makes an AJAX request to an APM application running an incompatible agent, then the APM agent may not record transaction and span data for that request. If distributed tracing is enabled for a browser application and you are not seeing transaction or span data for downstream APM requests, review the browser data in distributed tracing requirements, and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. Not seeing browser app end-user spans If traces seem to be missing end-user spans, be sure you've read and understand the browser distributed tracing requirements and enable procedures. On the AJAX UI page, there are links to the distributed tracing UI regardless of whether there are end-user spans present in that trace. For details about what data generates spans, see Requirements. Browser spans are not connected to other spans Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If APM spans are missing consistently from traces that include browser applications, please refer to the browser data in distributed tracing requirements and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. For other causes of orphaned browser spans, see Browser span reporting.

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in mobile, browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Problem You have enabled distributed tracing but data you expected to see does not appear in New Relic's distributed tracing UI. Solution Important Before performing troubleshooting, we recommend reading How distributed tracing works. Here are some causes and solutions when you have problems finding expected data in the distributed tracing UI: Problems with enabling or instrumenting Missing spans due to service not having distributed tracing enabled In order for distributed tracing to report details for all nodes in a trace, each application must be monitored by a New Relic agent that has had distributed tracing enabled. If an application's New Relic account has not had distributed tracing enabled, it will have these issues: Its distributed tracing UI page won't have data. It won't report data to other accounts' distributed traces. Missing apps/services may require manual instrumentation When you enable distributed tracing for applications and services that New Relic automatically instruments, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some services or applications are missing from traces, or that there are some internal spans you expect to see that are missing. If that's the case, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the New Relic agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the New Relic agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application. Problems with spans Infinite Tracing: missing spans If your APM agent can’t write data fast enough to the trace observer, queue_size is an additional APM agent configuration to limit the number of spans the agent will hold. See the following examples for your agent: .NET configuration method Example Configuration file <configuration . . . > <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer> <span_events queue_size=\"100000\" /> </trace_observer> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy Environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_EVENTS_QUEUE_SIZE=100000 Copy Python configuration method Example Configuration file infinite_tracing.span_queue_size = 100000 Environment Variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000 Missing span not getting exported Sometimes header propagation is successful, but the span information isn't getting sent to New Relic. For example, if OpenTelemetry is not instrumented with a New Relic exporter, the span details never make it to New Relic. In this diagram, notice that the header propagation is successful, but no exporter is set up in Service 2 to send the span to New Relic: The following diagram also shows successful header propagation, but it includes an exporter in Service 2 that sends the span details to New Relic (see Trace API): Missing spans due to sampling process Standard distributed tracing for APM uses adaptive sampling. This means that a percentage of calls to a service will be reported as part of a distributed trace. Specific calls to your service might not have been selected to be sampled. Missing spans due to span limits maxed out There are limits on the number of spans that can be collected and displayed. If an application generates a very large number of spans for a single call, it might exceed the APM agent's span-collection limit for that harvest cycle. This could result in missing spans and significantly limit the number of traces the agent can completely sample and report. We currently only show 10,000 spans at a time. Missing spans due to spans being sent late Spans must be sent within the last twenty minutes to be captured in a trace index. If you send any spans older than twenty minutes but newer than a day, the span data will still be written. However, it won't be rolled into the trace index, which controls the trace list in the distributed tracing UI. If a span has a timestamp older than a day, it will be dropped. This often occurs when there is clock skew (timing differences) between systems or long running background jobs. Problems with trace details Middleware doesn't recognize proprietary New Relic header If your transactions are only sending the proprietary New Relic header, some middleware might not recognize the format and then drop the information as shown in this diagram: One solution is to upgrade your New Relic agent to a version that supports W3C trace context. In the diagram below, the W3C-compliant New Relic agent passes the prior header along with two standardized headers: An intermediary is missing or isn't passing trace context Some potential problems with proxies and other intermediaries: Incomplete trace. Some intermediaries won't automatically propagate the distributed tracing header. In that case, you must configure that component to allow the header to be passed from source to destination. For instructions, consult the documentation for that intermediary component. Missing intermediary in trace. If the intermediary is New Relic-monitored, ensure that it propagates the newrelic header that is generated or updated by the New Relic agent running on that intermediary. This may manifest when an intermediary was previously visible in traces, but disappeared after distributed tracing was enabled for an upstream entity (for example, a browser-monitored application). Tip If some entities report trace data to another tracing system, you can use the trace ID from the New Relic UI to search other tracing systems for missing spans. Stitching together spans from mixed sources If each agent in a chain supports W3C Trace Context, then we can stitch the spans together into a complete trace. If part of the chain is from an agent, such as Zipkin, which doesn't support W3C Trace Context, then spans coming from that agent may not be included in the trace. Trace details are obfuscated If a trace contains data from applications monitored by multiple New Relic accounts, and your user permissions don't allow you to access those accounts, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. For example, you may see a series of asterisks ( * * * * * ) instead of the service name in your distributed tracing list if you don't have access to the account linked with the service. Trace list information and trace details don't match The trace list is generated by trace indexes, which are captured in a twenty minute window from when the first spans are received. Usually, this is due to late spans. Long traces with short backend times If you're seeing unusually short backend times for long traces, this is likely an issue with the timestamps being sent. For example, the root span might be reposting microseconds as milliseconds. This can also happen if the root span is a browser application. When using an external client like a web browser, you may experience clock skew (timing differences) more often. Problems with browser applications Missing spans and transactions after enabling for a browser application Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If the browser application makes an AJAX request to an APM application running an incompatible agent, then the APM agent may not record transaction and span data for that request. If distributed tracing is enabled for a browser application and you are not seeing transaction or span data for downstream APM requests, review the browser data in distributed tracing requirements, and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. Not seeing browser app end-user spans If traces seem to be missing end-user spans, be sure you've read and understand the browser distributed tracing requirements and enable procedures. On the AJAX UI page, there are links to the distributed tracing UI regardless of whether there are end-user spans present in that trace. For details about what data generates spans, see Requirements. Browser spans are not connected to other spans Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If APM spans are missing consistently from traces that include browser applications, please refer to the browser data in distributed tracing requirements and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. For other causes of orphaned browser spans, see Browser span reporting.

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in mobile, browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Problem You have enabled distributed tracing but data you expected to see does not appear in New Relic's distributed tracing UI. Solution Important Before performing troubleshooting, we recommend reading How distributed tracing works. Here are some causes and solutions when you have problems finding expected data in the distributed tracing UI: Problems with enabling or instrumenting Missing spans due to service not having distributed tracing enabled In order for distributed tracing to report details for all nodes in a trace, each application must be monitored by a New Relic agent that has had distributed tracing enabled. If an application's New Relic account has not had distributed tracing enabled, it will have these issues: Its distributed tracing UI page won't have data. It won't report data to other accounts' distributed traces. Missing apps/services may require manual instrumentation When you enable distributed tracing for applications and services that New Relic automatically instruments, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some services or applications are missing from traces, or that there are some internal spans you expect to see that are missing. If that's the case, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the New Relic agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the New Relic agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application. Problems with spans Infinite Tracing: missing spans If your APM agent can’t write data fast enough to the trace observer, queue_size is an additional APM agent configuration to limit the number of spans the agent will hold. See the following examples for your agent: .NET configuration method Example Configuration file <configuration . . . > <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer> <span_events queue_size=\"100000\" /> </trace_observer> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy Environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_EVENTS_QUEUE_SIZE=100000 Copy Python configuration method Example Configuration file infinite_tracing.span_queue_size = 100000 Environment Variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000 Missing span not getting exported Sometimes header propagation is successful, but the span information isn't getting sent to New Relic. For example, if OpenTelemetry is not instrumented with a New Relic exporter, the span details never make it to New Relic. In this diagram, notice that the header propagation is successful, but no exporter is set up in Service 2 to send the span to New Relic: The following diagram also shows successful header propagation, but it includes an exporter in Service 2 that sends the span details to New Relic (see Trace API): Missing spans due to sampling process Standard distributed tracing for APM uses adaptive sampling. This means that a percentage of calls to a service will be reported as part of a distributed trace. Specific calls to your service might not have been selected to be sampled. Missing spans due to span limits maxed out There are limits on the number of spans that can be collected and displayed. If an application generates a very large number of spans for a single call, it might exceed the APM agent's span-collection limit for that harvest cycle. This could result in missing spans and significantly limit the number of traces the agent can completely sample and report. We currently only show 10,000 spans at a time. Missing spans due to spans being sent late Spans must be sent within the last twenty minutes to be captured in a trace index. If you send any spans older than twenty minutes but newer than a day, the span data will still be written. However, it won't be rolled into the trace index, which controls the trace list in the distributed tracing UI. If a span has a timestamp older than a day, it will be dropped. This often occurs when there is clock skew (timing differences) between systems or long running background jobs. Problems with trace details Middleware doesn't recognize proprietary New Relic header If your transactions are only sending the proprietary New Relic header, some middleware might not recognize the format and then drop the information as shown in this diagram: One solution is to upgrade your New Relic agent to a version that supports W3C trace context. In the diagram below, the W3C-compliant New Relic agent passes the prior header along with two standardized headers: An intermediary is missing or isn't passing trace context Some potential problems with proxies and other intermediaries: Incomplete trace. Some intermediaries won't automatically propagate the distributed tracing header. In that case, you must configure that component to allow the header to be passed from source to destination. For instructions, consult the documentation for that intermediary component. Missing intermediary in trace. If the intermediary is New Relic-monitored, ensure that it propagates the newrelic header that is generated or updated by the New Relic agent running on that intermediary. This may manifest when an intermediary was previously visible in traces, but disappeared after distributed tracing was enabled for an upstream entity (for example, a browser-monitored application). Tip If some entities report trace data to another tracing system, you can use the trace ID from the New Relic UI to search other tracing systems for missing spans. Stitching together spans from mixed sources If each agent in a chain supports W3C Trace Context, then we can stitch the spans together into a complete trace. If part of the chain is from an agent, such as Zipkin, which doesn't support W3C Trace Context, then spans coming from that agent may not be included in the trace. Trace details are obfuscated If a trace contains data from applications monitored by multiple New Relic accounts, and your user permissions don't allow you to access those accounts, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. For example, you may see a series of asterisks ( * * * * * ) instead of the service name in your distributed tracing list if you don't have access to the account linked with the service. Trace list information and trace details don't match The trace list is generated by trace indexes, which are captured in a twenty minute window from when the first spans are received. Usually, this is due to late spans. Long traces with short backend times If you're seeing unusually short backend times for long traces, this is likely an issue with the timestamps being sent. For example, the root span might be reposting microseconds as milliseconds. This can also happen if the root span is a browser application. When using an external client like a web browser, you may experience clock skew (timing differences) more often. Problems with browser applications Missing spans and transactions after enabling for a browser application Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If the browser application makes an AJAX request to an APM application running an incompatible agent, then the APM agent may not record transaction and span data for that request. If distributed tracing is enabled for a browser application and you are not seeing transaction or span data for downstream APM requests, review the browser data in distributed tracing requirements, and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. Not seeing browser app end-user spans If traces seem to be missing end-user spans, be sure you've read and understand the browser distributed tracing requirements and enable procedures. On the AJAX UI page, there are links to the distributed tracing UI regardless of whether there are end-user spans present in that trace. For details about what data generates spans, see Requirements. Browser spans are not connected to other spans Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If APM spans are missing consistently from traces that include browser applications, please refer to the browser data in distributed tracing requirements and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. For other causes of orphaned browser spans, see Browser span reporting. Other problems Search by entity.name not finding associated app names Potential cause: For applications that have multiple app names, the entity.name attribute will be associated only with the primary app name. To search by other app names, search using the appName attribute. Supporting OpenTelemetry Questions about integrating with OpenTelemetry should be taken to the Explorers Hub.",

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in mobile, browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Problem You have enabled distributed tracing but data you expected to see does not appear in New Relic's distributed tracing UI. Solution Important Before performing troubleshooting, we recommend reading How distributed tracing works. Here are some causes and solutions when you have problems finding expected data in the distributed tracing UI: Problems with enabling or instrumenting Missing spans due to service not having distributed tracing enabled In order for distributed tracing to report details for all nodes in a trace, each application must be monitored by a New Relic agent that has had distributed tracing enabled. If an application's New Relic account has not had distributed tracing enabled, it will have these issues: Its distributed tracing UI page won't have data. It won't report data to other accounts' distributed traces. Missing apps/services may require manual instrumentation When you enable distributed tracing for applications and services that New Relic automatically instruments, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some services or applications are missing from traces, or that there are some internal spans you expect to see that are missing. If that's the case, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the New Relic agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the New Relic agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application. Problems with spans Infinite Tracing: missing spans If your APM agent can’t write data fast enough to the trace observer, queue_size is an additional APM agent configuration to limit the number of spans the agent will hold. See the following examples for your agent: .NET configuration method Example Configuration file <configuration . . . > <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer> <span_events queue_size=\"100000\" /> </trace_observer> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy Environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_EVENTS_QUEUE_SIZE=100000 Copy Python configuration method Example Configuration file infinite_tracing.span_queue_size = 100000 Environment Variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000 Missing span not getting exported Sometimes header propagation is successful, but the span information isn't getting sent to New Relic. For example, if OpenTelemetry is not instrumented with a New Relic exporter, the span details never make it to New Relic. In this diagram, notice that the header propagation is successful, but no exporter is set up in Service 2 to send the span to New Relic: The following diagram also shows successful header propagation, but it includes an exporter in Service 2 that sends the span details to New Relic (see Trace API): Missing spans due to sampling process Standard distributed tracing for APM uses adaptive sampling. This means that a percentage of calls to a service will be reported as part of a distributed trace. Specific calls to your service might not have been selected to be sampled. Missing spans due to span limits maxed out There are limits on the number of spans that can be collected and displayed. If an application generates a very large number of spans for a single call, it might exceed the APM agent's span-collection limit for that harvest cycle. This could result in missing spans and significantly limit the number of traces the agent can completely sample and report. We currently only show 10,000 spans at a time. Missing spans due to spans being sent late Spans must be sent within the last twenty minutes to be captured in a trace index. If you send any spans older than twenty minutes but newer than a day, the span data will still be written. However, it won't be rolled into the trace index, which controls the trace list in the distributed tracing UI. If a span has a timestamp older than a day, it will be dropped. This often occurs when there is clock skew (timing differences) between systems or long running background jobs. Problems with trace details Middleware doesn't recognize proprietary New Relic header If your transactions are only sending the proprietary New Relic header, some middleware might not recognize the format and then drop the information as shown in this diagram: One solution is to upgrade your New Relic agent to a version that supports W3C trace context. In the diagram below, the W3C-compliant New Relic agent passes the prior header along with two standardized headers: An intermediary is missing or isn't passing trace context Some potential problems with proxies and other intermediaries: Incomplete trace. Some intermediaries won't automatically propagate the distributed tracing header. In that case, you must configure that component to allow the header to be passed from source to destination. For instructions, consult the documentation for that intermediary component. Missing intermediary in trace. If the intermediary is New Relic-monitored, ensure that it propagates the newrelic header that is generated or updated by the New Relic agent running on that intermediary. This may manifest when an intermediary was previously visible in traces, but disappeared after distributed tracing was enabled for an upstream entity (for example, a browser-monitored application). Tip If some entities report trace data to another tracing system, you can use the trace ID from the New Relic UI to search other tracing systems for missing spans. Stitching together spans from mixed sources If each agent in a chain supports W3C Trace Context, then we can stitch the spans together into a complete trace. If part of the chain is from an agent, such as Zipkin, which doesn't support W3C Trace Context, then spans coming from that agent may not be included in the trace. Trace details are obfuscated If a trace contains data from applications monitored by multiple New Relic accounts, and your user permissions don't allow you to access those accounts, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. For example, you may see a series of asterisks ( * * * * * ) instead of the service name in your distributed tracing list if you don't have access to the account linked with the service. Trace list information and trace details don't match The trace list is generated by trace indexes, which are captured in a twenty minute window from when the first spans are received. Usually, this is due to late spans. Long traces with short backend times If you're seeing unusually short backend times for long traces, this is likely an issue with the timestamps being sent. For example, the root span might be reposting microseconds as milliseconds. This can also happen if the root span is a browser application. When using an external client like a web browser, you may experience clock skew (timing differences) more often. Problems with browser applications Missing spans and transactions after enabling for a browser application Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If the browser application makes an AJAX request to an APM application running an incompatible agent, then the APM agent may not record transaction and span data for that request. If distributed tracing is enabled for a browser application and you are not seeing transaction or span data for downstream APM requests, review the browser data in distributed tracing requirements, and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. Not seeing browser app end-user spans If traces seem to be missing end-user spans, be sure you've read and understand the browser distributed tracing requirements and enable procedures. On the AJAX UI page, there are links to the distributed tracing UI regardless of whether there are end-user spans present in that trace. For details about what data generates spans, see Requirements. Browser spans are not connected to other spans Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If APM spans are missing consistently from traces that include browser applications, please refer to the browser data in distributed tracing requirements and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. For other causes of orphaned browser spans, see Browser span reporting. Other problems Search by entity.name not finding associated app names Potential cause: For applications that have multiple app names, the entity.name attribute will be associated only with the primary app name. To search by other app names, search using the appName attribute. Supporting OpenTelemetry Questions about integrating with OpenTelemetry should be taken to the Explorers Hub.",

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in mobile, browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Problem You have enabled distributed tracing but data you expected to see does not appear in New Relic's distributed tracing UI. Solution Important Before performing troubleshooting, we recommend reading How distributed tracing works. Here are some causes and solutions when you have problems finding expected data in the distributed tracing UI: Problems with enabling or instrumenting Missing spans due to service not having distributed tracing enabled In order for distributed tracing to report details for all nodes in a trace, each application must be monitored by a New Relic agent that has had distributed tracing enabled. If an application's New Relic account has not had distributed tracing enabled, it will have these issues: Its distributed tracing UI page won't have data. It won't report data to other accounts' distributed traces. Missing apps/services may require manual instrumentation When you enable distributed tracing for applications and services that New Relic automatically instruments, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some services or applications are missing from traces, or that there are some internal spans you expect to see that are missing. If that's the case, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the New Relic agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the New Relic agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application. Problems with spans Infinite Tracing: missing spans If your APM agent can’t write data fast enough to the trace observer, queue_size is an additional APM agent configuration to limit the number of spans the agent will hold. See the following examples for your agent: .NET configuration method Example Configuration file <configuration . . . > <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer> <span_events queue_size=\"100000\" /> </trace_observer> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy Environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_EVENTS_QUEUE_SIZE=100000 Copy Python configuration method Example Configuration file infinite_tracing.span_queue_size = 100000 Environment Variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000 Missing span not getting exported Sometimes header propagation is successful, but the span information isn't getting sent to New Relic. For example, if OpenTelemetry is not instrumented with a New Relic exporter, the span details never make it to New Relic. In this diagram, notice that the header propagation is successful, but no exporter is set up in Service 2 to send the span to New Relic: The following diagram also shows successful header propagation, but it includes an exporter in Service 2 that sends the span details to New Relic (see Trace API): Missing spans due to sampling process Standard distributed tracing for APM uses adaptive sampling. This means that a percentage of calls to a service will be reported as part of a distributed trace. Specific calls to your service might not have been selected to be sampled. Missing spans due to span limits maxed out There are limits on the number of spans that can be collected and displayed. If an application generates a very large number of spans for a single call, it might exceed the APM agent's span-collection limit for that harvest cycle. This could result in missing spans and significantly limit the number of traces the agent can completely sample and report. We currently only show 10,000 spans at a time. Missing spans due to spans being sent late Spans must be sent within the last twenty minutes to be captured in a trace index. If you send any spans older than twenty minutes but newer than a day, the span data will still be written. However, it won't be rolled into the trace index, which controls the trace list in the distributed tracing UI. If a span has a timestamp older than a day, it will be dropped. This often occurs when there is clock skew (timing differences) between systems or long running background jobs. Problems with trace details Middleware doesn't recognize proprietary New Relic header If your transactions are only sending the proprietary New Relic header, some middleware might not recognize the format and then drop the information as shown in this diagram: One solution is to upgrade your New Relic agent to a version that supports W3C trace context. In the diagram below, the W3C-compliant New Relic agent passes the prior header along with two standardized headers: An intermediary is missing or isn't passing trace context Some potential problems with proxies and other intermediaries: Incomplete trace. Some intermediaries won't automatically propagate the distributed tracing header. In that case, you must configure that component to allow the header to be passed from source to destination. For instructions, consult the documentation for that intermediary component. Missing intermediary in trace. If the intermediary is New Relic-monitored, ensure that it propagates the newrelic header that is generated or updated by the New Relic agent running on that intermediary. This may manifest when an intermediary was previously visible in traces, but disappeared after distributed tracing was enabled for an upstream entity (for example, a browser-monitored application). Tip If some entities report trace data to another tracing system, you can use the trace ID from the New Relic UI to search other tracing systems for missing spans. Stitching together spans from mixed sources If each agent in a chain supports W3C Trace Context, then we can stitch the spans together into a complete trace. If part of the chain is from an agent, such as Zipkin, which doesn't support W3C Trace Context, then spans coming from that agent may not be included in the trace. Trace details are obfuscated If a trace contains data from applications monitored by multiple New Relic accounts, and your user permissions don't allow you to access those accounts, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. For example, you may see a series of asterisks ( * * * * * ) instead of the service name in your distributed tracing list if you don't have access to the account linked with the service. Trace list information and trace details don't match The trace list is generated by trace indexes, which are captured in a twenty minute window from when the first spans are received. Usually, this is due to late spans. Long traces with short backend times If you're seeing unusually short backend times for long traces, this is likely an issue with the timestamps being sent. For example, the root span might be reposting microseconds as milliseconds. This can also happen if the root span is a browser application. When using an external client like a web browser, you may experience clock skew (timing differences) more often. Problems with browser applications Missing spans and transactions after enabling for a browser application Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If the browser application makes an AJAX request to an APM application running an incompatible agent, then the APM agent may not record transaction and span data for that request. If distributed tracing is enabled for a browser application and you are not seeing transaction or span data for downstream APM requests, review the browser data in distributed tracing requirements, and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. Not seeing browser app end-user spans If traces seem to be missing end-user spans, be sure you've read and understand the browser distributed tracing requirements and enable procedures. On the AJAX UI page, there are links to the distributed tracing UI regardless of whether there are end-user spans present in that trace. For details about what data generates spans, see Requirements. Browser spans are not connected to other spans Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If APM spans are missing consistently from traces that include browser applications, please refer to the browser data in distributed tracing requirements and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. For other causes of orphaned browser spans, see Browser span reporting. Other problems Search by entity.name not finding associated app names Potential cause: For applications that have multiple app names, the entity.name attribute will be associated only with the primary app name. To search by other app names, search using the appName attribute. Supporting OpenTelemetry Questions about integrating with OpenTelemetry should be taken to the Explorers Hub.",

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in mobile, browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Problem You have enabled distributed tracing but data you expected to see does not appear in New Relic's distributed tracing UI. Solution Important Before performing troubleshooting, we recommend reading How distributed tracing works. Here are some causes and solutions when you have problems finding expected data in the distributed tracing UI: Problems with enabling or instrumenting Missing spans due to service not having distributed tracing enabled In order for distributed tracing to report details for all nodes in a trace, each application must be monitored by a New Relic agent that has had distributed tracing enabled. If an application's New Relic account has not had distributed tracing enabled, it will have these issues: Its distributed tracing UI page won't have data. It won't report data to other accounts' distributed traces. Missing apps/services may require manual instrumentation When you enable distributed tracing for applications and services that New Relic automatically instruments, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some services or applications are missing from traces, or that there are some internal spans you expect to see that are missing. If that's the case, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the New Relic agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the New Relic agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application. Problems with spans Infinite Tracing: missing spans If your APM agent can’t write data fast enough to the trace observer, queue_size is an additional APM agent configuration to limit the number of spans the agent will hold. See the following examples for your agent: .NET configuration method Example Configuration file <configuration . . . > <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer> <span_events queue_size=\"100000\" /> </trace_observer> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy Environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_EVENTS_QUEUE_SIZE=100000 Copy Python configuration method Example Configuration file infinite_tracing.span_queue_size = 100000 Environment Variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000 Missing span not getting exported Sometimes header propagation is successful, but the span information isn't getting sent to New Relic. For example, if OpenTelemetry is not instrumented with a New Relic exporter, the span details never make it to New Relic. In this diagram, notice that the header propagation is successful, but no exporter is set up in Service 2 to send the span to New Relic: The following diagram also shows successful header propagation, but it includes an exporter in Service 2 that sends the span details to New Relic (see Trace API): Missing spans due to sampling process Standard distributed tracing for APM uses adaptive sampling. This means that a percentage of calls to a service will be reported as part of a distributed trace. Specific calls to your service might not have been selected to be sampled. Missing spans due to span limits maxed out There are limits on the number of spans that can be collected and displayed. If an application generates a very large number of spans for a single call, it might exceed the APM agent's span-collection limit for that harvest cycle. This could result in missing spans and significantly limit the number of traces the agent can completely sample and report. We currently only show 10,000 spans at a time. Missing spans due to spans being sent late Spans must be sent within the last twenty minutes to be captured in a trace index. If you send any spans older than twenty minutes but newer than a day, the span data will still be written. However, it won't be rolled into the trace index, which controls the trace list in the distributed tracing UI. If a span has a timestamp older than a day, it will be dropped. This often occurs when there is clock skew (timing differences) between systems or long running background jobs. Problems with trace details Middleware doesn't recognize proprietary New Relic header If your transactions are only sending the proprietary New Relic header, some middleware might not recognize the format and then drop the information as shown in this diagram: One solution is to upgrade your New Relic agent to a version that supports W3C trace context. In the diagram below, the W3C-compliant New Relic agent passes the prior header along with two standardized headers: An intermediary is missing or isn't passing trace context Some potential problems with proxies and other intermediaries: Incomplete trace. Some intermediaries won't automatically propagate the distributed tracing header. In that case, you must configure that component to allow the header to be passed from source to destination. For instructions, consult the documentation for that intermediary component. Missing intermediary in trace. If the intermediary is New Relic-monitored, ensure that it propagates the newrelic header that is generated or updated by the New Relic agent running on that intermediary. This may manifest when an intermediary was previously visible in traces, but disappeared after distributed tracing was enabled for an upstream entity (for example, a browser-monitored application). Tip If some entities report trace data to another tracing system, you can use the trace ID from the New Relic UI to search other tracing systems for missing spans. Stitching together spans from mixed sources If each agent in a chain supports W3C Trace Context, then we can stitch the spans together into a complete trace. If part of the chain is from an agent, such as Zipkin, which doesn't support W3C Trace Context, then spans coming from that agent may not be included in the trace. Trace details are obfuscated If a trace contains data from applications monitored by multiple New Relic accounts, and your user permissions don't allow you to access those accounts, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. For example, you may see a series of asterisks ( * * * * * ) instead of the service name in your distributed tracing list if you don't have access to the account linked with the service. Trace list information and trace details don't match The trace list is generated by trace indexes, which are captured in a twenty minute window from when the first spans are received. Usually, this is due to late spans. Long traces with short backend times If you're seeing unusually short backend times for long traces, this is likely an issue with the timestamps being sent. For example, the root span might be reposting microseconds as milliseconds. This can also happen if the root span is a browser application. When using an external client like a web browser, you may experience clock skew (timing differences) more often. Problems with browser applications Missing spans and transactions after enabling for a browser application Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If the browser application makes an AJAX request to an APM application running an incompatible agent, then the APM agent may not record transaction and span data for that request. If distributed tracing is enabled for a browser application and you are not seeing transaction or span data for downstream APM requests, review the browser data in distributed tracing requirements, and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. Not seeing browser app end-user spans If traces seem to be missing end-user spans, be sure you've read and understand the browser distributed tracing requirements and enable procedures. On the AJAX UI page, there are links to the distributed tracing UI regardless of whether there are end-user spans present in that trace. For details about what data generates spans, see Requirements. Browser spans are not connected to other spans Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If APM spans are missing consistently from traces that include browser applications, please refer to the browser data in distributed tracing requirements and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. For other causes of orphaned browser spans, see Browser span reporting. Other problems Search by entity.name not finding associated app names Potential cause: For applications that have multiple app names, the entity.name attribute will be associated only with the primary app name. To search by other app names, search using the appName attribute. Supporting OpenTelemetry Questions about integrating with OpenTelemetry should be taken to the Explorers Hub.",

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in mobile, browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Problem You have enabled distributed tracing but data you expected to see does not appear in New Relic's distributed tracing UI. Solution Important Before performing troubleshooting, we recommend reading How distributed tracing works. Here are some causes and solutions when you have problems finding expected data in the distributed tracing UI: Problems with enabling or instrumenting Missing spans due to service not having distributed tracing enabled In order for distributed tracing to report details for all nodes in a trace, each application must be monitored by a New Relic agent that has had distributed tracing enabled. If an application's New Relic account has not had distributed tracing enabled, it will have these issues: Its distributed tracing UI page won't have data. It won't report data to other accounts' distributed traces. Missing apps/services may require manual instrumentation When you enable distributed tracing for applications and services that New Relic automatically instruments, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some services or applications are missing from traces, or that there are some internal spans you expect to see that are missing. If that's the case, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the New Relic agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the New Relic agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application. Problems with spans Infinite Tracing: missing spans If your APM agent can’t write data fast enough to the trace observer, queue_size is an additional APM agent configuration to limit the number of spans the agent will hold. See the following examples for your agent: .NET configuration method Example Configuration file <configuration . . . > <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer> <span_events queue_size=\"100000\" /> </trace_observer> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy Environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_EVENTS_QUEUE_SIZE=100000 Copy Python configuration method Example Configuration file infinite_tracing.span_queue_size = 100000 Environment Variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000 Missing span not getting exported Sometimes header propagation is successful, but the span information isn't getting sent to New Relic. For example, if OpenTelemetry is not instrumented with a New Relic exporter, the span details never make it to New Relic. In this diagram, notice that the header propagation is successful, but no exporter is set up in Service 2 to send the span to New Relic: The following diagram also shows successful header propagation, but it includes an exporter in Service 2 that sends the span details to New Relic (see Trace API): Missing spans due to sampling process Standard distributed tracing for APM uses adaptive sampling. This means that a percentage of calls to a service will be reported as part of a distributed trace. Specific calls to your service might not have been selected to be sampled. Missing spans due to span limits maxed out There are limits on the number of spans that can be collected and displayed. If an application generates a very large number of spans for a single call, it might exceed the APM agent's span-collection limit for that harvest cycle. This could result in missing spans and significantly limit the number of traces the agent can completely sample and report. We currently only show 10,000 spans at a time. Missing spans due to spans being sent late Spans must be sent within the last twenty minutes to be captured in a trace index. If you send any spans older than twenty minutes but newer than a day, the span data will still be written. However, it won't be rolled into the trace index, which controls the trace list in the distributed tracing UI. If a span has a timestamp older than a day, it will be dropped. This often occurs when there is clock skew (timing differences) between systems or long running background jobs. Problems with trace details Middleware doesn't recognize proprietary New Relic header If your transactions are only sending the proprietary New Relic header, some middleware might not recognize the format and then drop the information as shown in this diagram: One solution is to upgrade your New Relic agent to a version that supports W3C trace context. In the diagram below, the W3C-compliant New Relic agent passes the prior header along with two standardized headers: An intermediary is missing or isn't passing trace context Some potential problems with proxies and other intermediaries: Incomplete trace. Some intermediaries won't automatically propagate the distributed tracing header. In that case, you must configure that component to allow the header to be passed from source to destination. For instructions, consult the documentation for that intermediary component. Missing intermediary in trace. If the intermediary is New Relic-monitored, ensure that it propagates the newrelic header that is generated or updated by the New Relic agent running on that intermediary. This may manifest when an intermediary was previously visible in traces, but disappeared after distributed tracing was enabled for an upstream entity (for example, a browser-monitored application). Tip If some entities report trace data to another tracing system, you can use the trace ID from the New Relic UI to search other tracing systems for missing spans. Stitching together spans from mixed sources If each agent in a chain supports W3C Trace Context, then we can stitch the spans together into a complete trace. If part of the chain is from an agent, such as Zipkin, which doesn't support W3C Trace Context, then spans coming from that agent may not be included in the trace. Trace details are obfuscated If a trace contains data from applications monitored by multiple New Relic accounts, and your user permissions don't allow you to access those accounts, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. For example, you may see a series of asterisks ( * * * * * ) instead of the service name in your distributed tracing list if you don't have access to the account linked with the service. Trace list information and trace details don't match The trace list is generated by trace indexes, which are captured in a twenty minute window from when the first spans are received. Usually, this is due to late spans. Long traces with short backend times If you're seeing unusually short backend times for long traces, this is likely an issue with the timestamps being sent. For example, the root span might be reposting microseconds as milliseconds. This can also happen if the root span is a browser application. When using an external client like a web browser, you may experience clock skew (timing differences) more often. Problems with browser applications Missing spans and transactions after enabling for a browser application Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If the browser application makes an AJAX request to an APM application running an incompatible agent, then the APM agent may not record transaction and span data for that request. If distributed tracing is enabled for a browser application and you are not seeing transaction or span data for downstream APM requests, review the browser data in distributed tracing requirements, and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. Not seeing browser app end-user spans If traces seem to be missing end-user spans, be sure you've read and understand the browser distributed tracing requirements and enable procedures. On the AJAX UI page, there are links to the distributed tracing UI regardless of whether there are end-user spans present in that trace. For details about what data generates spans, see Requirements. Browser spans are not connected to other spans Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If APM spans are missing consistently from traces that include browser applications, please refer to the browser data in distributed tracing requirements and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. For other causes of orphaned browser spans, see Browser span reporting.

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in mobile, browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Problem You have enabled distributed tracing but data you expected to see does not appear in New Relic's distributed tracing UI. Solution Important Before performing troubleshooting, we recommend reading How distributed tracing works. Here are some causes and solutions when you have problems finding expected data in the distributed tracing UI: Problems with enabling or instrumenting Missing spans due to service not having distributed tracing enabled In order for distributed tracing to report details for all nodes in a trace, each application must be monitored by a New Relic agent that has had distributed tracing enabled. If an application's New Relic account has not had distributed tracing enabled, it will have these issues: Its distributed tracing UI page won't have data. It won't report data to other accounts' distributed traces. Missing apps/services may require manual instrumentation When you enable distributed tracing for applications and services that New Relic automatically instruments, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some services or applications are missing from traces, or that there are some internal spans you expect to see that are missing. If that's the case, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the New Relic agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the New Relic agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application. Problems with spans Infinite Tracing: missing spans If your APM agent can’t write data fast enough to the trace observer, queue_size is an additional APM agent configuration to limit the number of spans the agent will hold. See the following examples for your agent: .NET configuration method Example Configuration file <configuration . . . > <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer> <span_events queue_size=\"100000\" /> </trace_observer> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy Environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_EVENTS_QUEUE_SIZE=100000 Copy Python configuration method Example Configuration file infinite_tracing.span_queue_size = 100000 Environment Variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000 Missing span not getting exported Sometimes header propagation is successful, but the span information isn't getting sent to New Relic. For example, if OpenTelemetry is not instrumented with a New Relic exporter, the span details never make it to New Relic. In this diagram, notice that the header propagation is successful, but no exporter is set up in Service 2 to send the span to New Relic: The following diagram also shows successful header propagation, but it includes an exporter in Service 2 that sends the span details to New Relic (see Trace API): Missing spans due to sampling process Standard distributed tracing for APM uses adaptive sampling. This means that a percentage of calls to a service will be reported as part of a distributed trace. Specific calls to your service might not have been selected to be sampled. Missing spans due to span limits maxed out There are limits on the number of spans that can be collected and displayed. If an application generates a very large number of spans for a single call, it might exceed the APM agent's span-collection limit for that harvest cycle. This could result in missing spans and significantly limit the number of traces the agent can completely sample and report. We currently only show 10,000 spans at a time. Missing spans due to spans being sent late Spans must be sent within the last twenty minutes to be captured in a trace index. If you send any spans older than twenty minutes but newer than a day, the span data will still be written. However, it won't be rolled into the trace index, which controls the trace list in the distributed tracing UI. If a span has a timestamp older than a day, it will be dropped. This often occurs when there is clock skew (timing differences) between systems or long running background jobs. Problems with trace details Middleware doesn't recognize proprietary New Relic header If your transactions are only sending the proprietary New Relic header, some middleware might not recognize the format and then drop the information as shown in this diagram: One solution is to upgrade your New Relic agent to a version that supports W3C trace context. In the diagram below, the W3C-compliant New Relic agent passes the prior header along with two standardized headers: An intermediary is missing or isn't passing trace context Some potential problems with proxies and other intermediaries: Incomplete trace. Some intermediaries won't automatically propagate the distributed tracing header. In that case, you must configure that component to allow the header to be passed from source to destination. For instructions, consult the documentation for that intermediary component. Missing intermediary in trace. If the intermediary is New Relic-monitored, ensure that it propagates the newrelic header that is generated or updated by the New Relic agent running on that intermediary. This may manifest when an intermediary was previously visible in traces, but disappeared after distributed tracing was enabled for an upstream entity (for example, a browser-monitored application). Tip If some entities report trace data to another tracing system, you can use the trace ID from the New Relic UI to search other tracing systems for missing spans. Stitching together spans from mixed sources If each agent in a chain supports W3C Trace Context, then we can stitch the spans together into a complete trace. If part of the chain is from an agent, such as Zipkin, which doesn't support W3C Trace Context, then spans coming from that agent may not be included in the trace. Trace details are obfuscated If a trace contains data from applications monitored by multiple New Relic accounts, and your user permissions don't allow you to access those accounts, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. For example, you may see a series of asterisks ( * * * * * ) instead of the service name in your distributed tracing list if you don't have access to the account linked with the service. Trace list information and trace details don't match The trace list is generated by trace indexes, which are captured in a twenty minute window from when the first spans are received. Usually, this is due to late spans. Long traces with short backend times If you're seeing unusually short backend times for long traces, this is likely an issue with the timestamps being sent. For example, the root span might be reposting microseconds as milliseconds. This can also happen if the root span is a browser application. When using an external client like a web browser, you may experience clock skew (timing differences) more often. Problems with browser applications Missing spans and transactions after enabling for a browser application Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If the browser application makes an AJAX request to an APM application running an incompatible agent, then the APM agent may not record transaction and span data for that request. If distributed tracing is enabled for a browser application and you are not seeing transaction or span data for downstream APM requests, review the browser data in distributed tracing requirements, and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. Not seeing browser app end-user spans If traces seem to be missing end-user spans, be sure you've read and understand the browser distributed tracing requirements and enable procedures. On the AJAX UI page, there are links to the distributed tracing UI regardless of whether there are end-user spans present in that trace. For details about what data generates spans, see Requirements. Browser spans are not connected to other spans Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If APM spans are missing consistently from traces that include browser applications, please refer to the browser data in distributed tracing requirements and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. For other causes of orphaned browser spans, see Browser span reporting.

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in mobile, browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Problem You have enabled distributed tracing but data you expected to see does not appear in New Relic's distributed tracing UI. Solution Important Before performing troubleshooting, we recommend reading How distributed tracing works. Here are some causes and solutions when you have problems finding expected data in the distributed tracing UI: Problems with enabling or instrumenting Missing spans due to service not having distributed tracing enabled In order for distributed tracing to report details for all nodes in a trace, each application must be monitored by a New Relic agent that has had distributed tracing enabled. If an application's New Relic account has not had distributed tracing enabled, it will have these issues: Its distributed tracing UI page won't have data. It won't report data to other accounts' distributed traces. Missing apps/services may require manual instrumentation When you enable distributed tracing for applications and services that New Relic automatically instruments, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some services or applications are missing from traces, or that there are some internal spans you expect to see that are missing. If that's the case, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the New Relic agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the New Relic agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application. Problems with spans Infinite Tracing: missing spans If your APM agent can’t write data fast enough to the trace observer, queue_size is an additional APM agent configuration to limit the number of spans the agent will hold. See the following examples for your agent: .NET configuration method Example Configuration file <configuration . . . > <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer> <span_events queue_size=\"100000\" /> </trace_observer> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy Environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_EVENTS_QUEUE_SIZE=100000 Copy Python configuration method Example Configuration file infinite_tracing.span_queue_size = 100000 Environment Variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000 Missing span not getting exported Sometimes header propagation is successful, but the span information isn't getting sent to New Relic. For example, if OpenTelemetry is not instrumented with a New Relic exporter, the span details never make it to New Relic. In this diagram, notice that the header propagation is successful, but no exporter is set up in Service 2 to send the span to New Relic: The following diagram also shows successful header propagation, but it includes an exporter in Service 2 that sends the span details to New Relic (see Trace API): Missing spans due to sampling process Standard distributed tracing for APM uses adaptive sampling. This means that a percentage of calls to a service will be reported as part of a distributed trace. Specific calls to your service might not have been selected to be sampled. Missing spans due to span limits maxed out There are limits on the number of spans that can be collected and displayed. If an application generates a very large number of spans for a single call, it might exceed the APM agent's span-collection limit for that harvest cycle. This could result in missing spans and significantly limit the number of traces the agent can completely sample and report. We currently only show 10,000 spans at a time. Missing spans due to spans being sent late Spans must be sent within the last twenty minutes to be captured in a trace index. If you send any spans older than twenty minutes but newer than a day, the span data will still be written. However, it won't be rolled into the trace index, which controls the trace list in the distributed tracing UI. If a span has a timestamp older than a day, it will be dropped. This often occurs when there is clock skew (timing differences) between systems or long running background jobs. Problems with trace details Middleware doesn't recognize proprietary New Relic header If your transactions are only sending the proprietary New Relic header, some middleware might not recognize the format and then drop the information as shown in this diagram: One solution is to upgrade your New Relic agent to a version that supports W3C trace context. In the diagram below, the W3C-compliant New Relic agent passes the prior header along with two standardized headers: An intermediary is missing or isn't passing trace context Some potential problems with proxies and other intermediaries: Incomplete trace. Some intermediaries won't automatically propagate the distributed tracing header. In that case, you must configure that component to allow the header to be passed from source to destination. For instructions, consult the documentation for that intermediary component. Missing intermediary in trace. If the intermediary is New Relic-monitored, ensure that it propagates the newrelic header that is generated or updated by the New Relic agent running on that intermediary. This may manifest when an intermediary was previously visible in traces, but disappeared after distributed tracing was enabled for an upstream entity (for example, a browser-monitored application). Tip If some entities report trace data to another tracing system, you can use the trace ID from the New Relic UI to search other tracing systems for missing spans. Stitching together spans from mixed sources If each agent in a chain supports W3C Trace Context, then we can stitch the spans together into a complete trace. If part of the chain is from an agent, such as Zipkin, which doesn't support W3C Trace Context, then spans coming from that agent may not be included in the trace. Trace details are obfuscated If a trace contains data from applications monitored by multiple New Relic accounts, and your user permissions don't allow you to access those accounts, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. For example, you may see a series of asterisks ( * * * * * ) instead of the service name in your distributed tracing list if you don't have access to the account linked with the service. Trace list information and trace details don't match The trace list is generated by trace indexes, which are captured in a twenty minute window from when the first spans are received. Usually, this is due to late spans. Long traces with short backend times If you're seeing unusually short backend times for long traces, this is likely an issue with the timestamps being sent. For example, the root span might be reposting microseconds as milliseconds. This can also happen if the root span is a browser application. When using an external client like a web browser, you may experience clock skew (timing differences) more often. Problems with browser applications Missing spans and transactions after enabling for a browser application Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If the browser application makes an AJAX request to an APM application running an incompatible agent, then the APM agent may not record transaction and span data for that request. If distributed tracing is enabled for a browser application and you are not seeing transaction or span data for downstream APM requests, review the browser data in distributed tracing requirements, and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. Not seeing browser app end-user spans If traces seem to be missing end-user spans, be sure you've read and understand the browser distributed tracing requirements and enable procedures. On the AJAX UI page, there are links to the distributed tracing UI regardless of whether there are end-user spans present in that trace. For details about what data generates spans, see Requirements. Browser spans are not connected to other spans Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If APM spans are missing consistently from traces that include browser applications, please refer to the browser data in distributed tracing requirements and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. For other causes of orphaned browser spans, see Browser span reporting. Other problems Search by entity.name not finding associated app names Potential cause: For applications that have multiple app names, the entity.name attribute will be associated only with the primary app name. To search by other app names, search using the appName attribute. Supporting OpenTelemetry Questions about integrating with OpenTelemetry should be taken to the Explorers Hub.",

      "body": "Here is information about using the legacy APM service maps feature to create, customize, and use service maps. For help using the current service maps feature, see How to use service maps. Requirements The legacy service map features in APM depend on your New Relic agent version: Feature Requirements App visibility For your app to appear in service maps, one of the following must be true: Your app must have the minimum agent version required for distributed tracing and have distributed tracing enabled. Note: Mobile monitoring doesn't support distributed tracing yet and will not show relationships to apps that have distributed tracing enabled. Your app must have the minimum APM agent version required for cross app tracing and have cross app tracing enabled. Host and instance visibility To view specific hosts, instances, and types of database information, your agent must meet the same minimum agent versions as the APM database and instance feature and use any of the compatible database drivers. Database-only visibility APM's service maps feature includes the ability to opt out of the deeper, host and instance level view. However, to view databases in service maps without the instance-level details, you must still meet the same minimum agent versions as the Database and slow queries features. Create maps The APM service maps feature helps you create your first map by providing default map or architecture suggestions that automatically build a default map (if you have more than ten reporting apps). To view these suggested maps, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service Maps > Suggested maps. To create a new map: Do one of the following: Start from scratch: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Create new map . Copy an existing map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > Save as new. Name your map. Rearrange, group, or add nodes on the map as needed. Important Previously, you could have private service maps. Now, all users can view, edit, and delete all existing or new service maps in the account. Save and rename maps Here are some tips about saving and renaming maps: Save To save changes to a map, select Save. To create a copy of the current map, select Save as new. Rename To rename a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the pencil icon next to the map name. Change the name, then select Save. Add or remove nodes on maps After you create or save a map, build out your map by adding nodes to it. Nodes are added to the map differently based on the node type. To remove any node from the map, mouse over the node, then select the remove X icon. Applications and mobile apps Nodes for applications or mobile apps need to be added to the map in order to add any other nodes. Nodes are added and connected into the map as you select them. The check mark icon means that node is already on the map. To add New Relic monitored apps or plugins to maps: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. Select any applications from the App/Service list. Rearrange or group together as needed. Browser, databases, external services, connected apps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. To add browser apps, databases, external services, or other connected apps to the map: Select an incoming or outgoing connection widget. From the list of connections, mouse over an app or service, then select the plus icon. Rearrange as needed. Custom nodes To add a custom node to the map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. From the App/Service list, select Create custom node. Name the node. Add connections: Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. Then select the plus icon on your target node. Select Save. Rearrange as needed. To add or remove custom node connections: Mouse over the custom node and select the pencil icon. Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. To add a connection, select the plus icon. To remove a connection, select the minus icon. Select Save. Move around the map Move around the map by panning or zooming in and out. If you want to... Do this... Pan the map In pan mode, click and drag. In drag-select mode, hold the Alt key, then click and drag. Zoom in and out In either mode, zoom in and out by scrolling the mouse wheel. View your entire map in traffic light mode Zoom out until node details fade out and are replaced by health status colors. Toggle the traffic light view on and off Select Views, then select Traffic light mode. View all the nodes and their dependencies Select Discover your environment. Drill down into more detail from a node Use standard UI functions. Select, arrange, group nodes Click on a node to select it and view its performance summary. You can also select multiple nodes at once, to group and ungroup them: Select nodes To select one node, click on the node. To select multiple nodes: Click the drag-select icon to switch to drag-select mode. Click and drag the mouse to draw a square around the nodes you want to select. OR Hold the Shift key and click on each node you want to select. Arrange nodes Caution Auto-arrange cannot be undone. Consider saving a copy of your map first. To arrange nodes on the map, select one or more node, then drag to a snap point on the map. To automatically organize all your nodes and connections, select Auto-arrange map. Group and ungroup nodes If you want to... Do this... Group nodes together on the map Select two or more nodes, then select Create group. Name your new group Mouse over the group, then select the pencil icon. Rename an existing group Select the pencil icon. Remove nodes from a group Select the group, then select the minus icon for each item you want to remove. Delete maps To delete a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the map name's pencil icon. Select Delete map. Identify issues with external services If your app connects to an external service that New Relic does not monitor (for example, a third-party API), New Relic watches the service for a week in order to baseline its response time. If New Relic can collect a statistically significant number of data points (more than 100), New Relic compares the current response time to this baseline and uses this to set the health status indicator: Green: Response time from the service is less than 1.75 times the baseline. Yellow: Response time from the service is longer than 1.75 times the baseline. Red: Response time from the service is longer than 2.5 times the baseline. Gray: Alerts concluded it does not have enough data to determine the health status. Purple: Alerts cannot yet conclude if it has enough data to determine the health status. Visualize and monitor complex architectures Use service maps to visualize and monitor complex architectures. For a tutorial introducing the latest features, select the service map's question icon. Nodes Nodes are the basic building blocks for your map. You can add a variety of node types including: Node type Description New Relic APM-monitored app Add your app to the map to view their connections to databases, browser apps, out-of-process services, and other instrumented apps. (In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are also referred to as web external or background external data.) Browser apps Automatically detected for each app and added via the incoming connections widget. Only displays browser apps linked to an APM app (standalone browser apps are not supported). New Relic mobile monitoring apps Automatically detected and added via the app/service list panel. Plugins, including Databases Automatically detected for each app and added via the connections widget. Databases in service maps require the same agent versions as the new Database page features. External services Service maps automatically detects external services (visible in the connections widget), to track your app's external dependencies and monitor the health of those connections. Custom nodes Add custom nodes via the app/service list panel to include apps and services not automatically instrumented by New Relic (for example, load balancers, implementation planning, and so on). Group nodes A group node contains multiple other nodes. For apps, group nodes include a summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. Node arrangement and grouping Click and drag a node to move it around the map, for a customizable view of your architecture. App nodes can also be grouped together into a single node to better organize related apps and services. Grouped nodes include summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. To remove items from a group, mouse over the group and select the pencil pencil icon, then select the minus minus-circle icon to remove the item from the group. Incoming and outgoing connections Service maps automatically detects incoming and outgoing connections based on HTTP calls between entities. Mouse over a node to highlight the node's connections. Widgets at the end of each node display a count of that node's connections, and you can click on those widgets to add related entities to the map: View performance summary Click on an app to view its performance over the last 30 minutes. The chart defaults to Response time, but you can view other metrics by selecting any of the available Apdex, Throughput, or Error rate links. While charts use the last 30 minutes of performance data, the service map as a whole is based on the last five minutes. View the app in APM or browser and view its labels by selecting the overflow ellipsis-v icon. Click the app name again to hide the summary charts, and select the overflow ellipsis-h icon again to hide other details. Map list and app/service list panels Select the Map list panel to: Search for and view your maps, and access other users' shared maps. Create a new map. Select the App/Service List panel to: Add new apps, mobile apps, and plugins to your map. Create custom nodes and add them to the map. Health status and performance metrics You can see health status indicators for most nodes. Except for out-of-process services (external services or background services), entities use the health status indicators used by New Relic Alerts. For out-of-process (external) services, the health status indicator measures the health of the connection to the external service. View all connected apps and services The Discover your environment feature allows you to view all of your apps, services, and dependencies together with a single click. This feature detects all connected applications and services (including externals and databases) to give you a comprehensive view of your overall software architecture environment. To view all connected apps and services: In APM, select Service maps. From your Map list, select Discover your environment to display all of your nodes. Hover over any node to view its dependencies and how it connects to other parts of your service map. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view their details. The Discover your environment feature may not be available if you are using an older New Relic agent version. See Troubleshooting cross application tracing for version information. This feature may also not be available for highly complex service maps with many elements. Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Discover your environment: Use this option to view all of your nodes and their dependencies in one place. Traffic light mode Traffic light mode lets you view the health status of your entire architecture at a glance. This feature helps you quickly find service and app problems, even within a complex environment with many nodes. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Traffic light mode. When traffic lights mode is On, zooming out far enough on a service map eventually causes the nodes to switch from displaying textual information, to only health status colors. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view more details. Traffic light mode is on by default. When traffic lights mode is Off, service map nodes retain their textual information and do not switch to health status colors, No matter how far you zoom out. one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Views > Traffic light mode: When traffic light mode is enabled, zooming out of your service map displays nodes in health status colors. Midnight mode Midnight mode inverts the screen's colors, going from a white background to a dark background. Midnight mode reduces eye strain, especially in low light environments. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Midnight mode.",

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

If New Relic can collect a statistically significant number of data points (more than 100), New Relic compares the current response time to this baseline and uses this to set the health status indicator: Green: Response time from the service is less than 1.75 times the baseline. Yellow: Response time from the service is longer than 1.75 times the baseline. Red: Response time from the service is longer than 2.5 times the baseline. Gray: Alerts concluded it does not have enough data to determine the health status. Purple: Alerts cannot yet conclude if it has enough data to determine the health status. Visualize and monitor complex architectures Use service maps to visualize and monitor complex architectures. For a tutorial introducing the latest features, select the service map's question icon. Nodes Nodes are the basic building blocks for your map. You can add a variety of node types including: Node type Description New Relic APM-monitored app Add your app to the map to view their connections to databases, browser apps, out-of-process services, and other instrumented apps. (In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are also referred to as web external or background external data.) Browser apps Automatically detected for each app and added via the incoming connections widget. Only displays browser apps linked to an APM app (standalone browser apps are not supported). New Relic mobile monitoring apps Automatically detected and added via the app/service list panel. Plugins, including Databases Automatically detected for each app and added via the connections widget. Databases in service maps require the same agent versions as the new Database page features. External services Service maps automatically detects external services (visible in the connections widget), to track your app's external dependencies and monitor the health of those connections. Custom nodes Add custom nodes via the app/service list panel to include apps and services not automatically instrumented by New Relic (for example, load balancers, implementation planning, and so on). Group nodes A group node contains multiple other nodes. For apps, group nodes include a summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. Node arrangement and grouping Click and drag a node to move it around the map, for a customizable view of your architecture. App nodes can also be grouped together into a single node to better organize related apps and services. Grouped nodes include summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. To remove items from a group, mouse over the group and select the pencil pencil icon, then select the minus minus-circle icon to remove the item from the group. Incoming and outgoing connections Service maps automatically detects incoming and outgoing connections based on HTTP calls between entities. Mouse over a node to highlight the node's connections. Widgets at the end of each node display a count of that node's connections, and you can click on those widgets to add related entities to the map: View performance summary Click on an app to view its performance over the last 30 minutes. The chart defaults to Response time, but you can view other metrics by selecting any of the available Apdex, Throughput, or Error rate links. While charts use the last 30 minutes of performance data, the service map as a whole is based on the last five minutes. View the app in APM or browser and view its labels by selecting the overflow ellipsis-v icon. Click the app name again to hide the summary charts, and select the overflow ellipsis-h icon again to hide other details. Map list and app/service list panels Select the Map list panel to: Search for and view your maps, and access other users' shared maps. Create a new map. Select the App/Service List panel to: Add new apps, mobile apps, and plugins to your map. Create custom nodes and add them to the map. Health status and performance metrics You can see health status indicators for most nodes. Except for out-of-process services (external services or background services), entities use the health status indicators used by New Relic Alerts. For out-of-process (external) services, the health status indicator measures the health of the connection to the external service. View all connected apps and services The Discover your environment feature allows you to view all of your apps, services, and dependencies together with a single click. This feature detects all connected applications and services (including externals and databases) to give you a comprehensive view of your overall software architecture environment. To view all connected apps and services: In APM, select Service maps. From your Map list, select Discover your environment to display all of your nodes. Hover over any node to view its dependencies and how it connects to other parts of your service map. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view their details. The Discover your environment feature may not be available if you are using an older New Relic agent version. See Troubleshooting cross application tracing for version information. This feature may also not be available for highly complex service maps with many elements. Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Discover your environment: Use this option to view all of your nodes and their dependencies in one place. Traffic light mode Traffic light mode lets you view the health status of your entire architecture at a glance. This feature helps you quickly find service and app problems, even within a complex environment with many nodes. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Traffic light mode. When traffic lights mode is On, zooming out far enough on a service map eventually causes the nodes to switch from displaying textual information, to only health status colors. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view more details. Traffic light mode is on by default. When traffic lights mode is Off, service map nodes retain their textual information and do not switch to health status colors, No matter how far you zoom out. one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Views > Traffic light mode: When traffic light mode is enabled, zooming out of your service map displays nodes in health status colors. Midnight mode Midnight mode inverts the screen's colors, going from a white background to a dark background. Midnight mode reduces eye strain, especially in low light environments. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Midnight mode.",

      "body": "Here are some technical details about how New Relic distributed tracing works: How trace sampling works How we structure trace data How we store trace data How trace context is passed between applications Tip For instructions about setting up distributed tracing, see Overview: Enable distributed tracing. Trace sampling How your traces are sampled will depend on your setup and the New Relic tracing tool you're using. For example, you may be using a third-party telemetry service (like OpenTelemetry) to implement sampling of traces before your data gets to us or, if you're using Infinite Tracing, you'd probably send us all your trace data and use our sampling. We have a few sampling strategies available: Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) No sampling Head-based sampling (standard distributed tracing) With the exception of our Infinite Tracing feature, most of our tracing tools use a head-based sampling approach. This applies filters to individual spans before all spans in a trace arrive, which means decisions about whether to accept spans is made at the beginning (the \"head\") of the filtering process. We use this sampling strategy to capture a representative sample of activity while avoiding storage and performance issues. Here are some details about how head-based sampling is implemented in our standard distributed tracing tools: Language agents: adaptive sampling Our APM language agents use adaptive sampling to capture a representative sample of system activity. The following is an explanation of how adaptive sampling works. For the first service in a distributed trace, 10 requests are chosen to be sampled. The throughput to that service is used to adjust how frequently requests are sampled. This is explained in more detail below. The first service we monitor in a distributed trace is called the trace origin. The trace origin chooses requests at random to be traced. That decision propagates to the downstream services touched by that request. When the request has completed, all of the spans touched by that request that we've detected are made available in the UI as a complete trace (though agent limits may result in fragmented traces). APM agents have a limit on the number of transactions collected per minute (this can vary, depending on agent) and a limit on the number of spans collected per minute (1000 per agent instance). To adhere to these limits, the default number of traces at the trace origin is 10 traces per minute. An APM agent spreads out the collection of these 10 traces over a minute in order to get a representative sample over time. The exact sampling rate depends on the number of transactions in the previous minute. The rate responds to changes in transaction throughput, going up or down. For example, if the previous minute had 100 transactions, the agent would anticipate a similar number of transactions and select 1 out of every 10 transactions to be traced. Language agents: limits and sampling An APM language agent instance using head-based sampling has a limit of 1000 spans per minute. The agent attempts to keep all spans that are marked to be sampled as part of a distributed trace. In many distributed systems, the average microservice may generate 10 to 20 spans per request. In those cases, the agent span limit can accommodate all spans chosen, and that service will have full detail in a trace. However, some requests to services will generate many spans, and the agent span limit will be reached. As a result, some traces will not have full detail for that service. One solution to this would be to custom instrument an agent to report less activity and therefore report fewer spans. To read about how browser monitoring of trace data may vary from our language agents, see Browser traces. Trace rate limiting If the above sampling methods still result in too much trace data, we may limit incoming data by sampling traces after they're received. By making this decision at the trace level, it avoids fragmenting traces (accepting only part of a trace). This process works similarly to adaptive sampling. The total spans received in a minute are totaled. If too many spans are received, fewer spans may be accepted in the following minute, in order to achieve a floating-average throughput rate. Lambda trace sampling Our AWS Lambda monitoring uses its own sampling process. Tail-based sampling (Infinite Tracing) Our Infinite Tracing feature uses a tail-based sampling approach. \"Tail-based sampling\" means that trace-retention decisions are done at the tail end of processing after all the spans in a trace have arrived. With Infinite Tracing, you can send us 100% of your trace data from your application or third-party telemetry service, and Infinite Tracing will figure out which trace data is most important. And you can configure the sampling to ensure the traces important to you are retained. Architecture For Infinite Tracing, agents or integrations send 100% of all instrumented spans to a trace observer. The trace observer is a distributed tracing service residing in a cluster of services on AWS called New Relic Edge. Tip Only your spans go to the trace observer—all other data such as metrics, custom events, and transaction traces are sent the normal route to New Relic and are subject to local sampling. You configure a unique trace observer endpoint for the AWS region you want to send data to. You can request multiple endpoints, one per AWS region. The endpoint represents a trace observer for a particular workload. For example, all spans from a single trace (request) must go to that endpoint. Here are two architectural diagrams: one showing how data flows if you use APM agents and another if you use New Relic integrations like OpenTelemetry exporters: The trace observer holds traces open while spans for that trace arrive. Once the first span in a trace arrives, a session is kept open for 10 seconds. Each time a new span for that trace arrives, the expiration time is reset to 10 seconds. Traces that haven't seen a span arrive within the last 10 seconds will automatically expire. Tail-based sampling algorithms By default, each trace observer offers traces to three samplers: one looking for duration outliers, one looking for traces with errors, and one trying to randomly sample across all trace types. Each sampler keeps a target percentage of traces that match their criteria. Here are details about each sampler: Sampler Matching criteria Target percent Duration Traces with an outlier duration, using two algorithms: Gaussian (Assumes a normal distribution and a threshold at the 99th percentile) Eccentricity (Assumes no distribution and a threshold based on cluster) 100% Error Traces having at least one span with an error 100% Random All traces 1% (This is configurable. See Infinite Tracing: Random trace filter) If the matching criteria matches the trace, each sampler looks at the trace’s shape. A trace’s shape is the unique combination of the root span’s entity name and span name. This is a simple way to separate traces using the entry point of the request. Once the shape is determined, the sampler makes a decision to keep or reject the trace based on its target sampling percent. If it’s 100%, the trace is automatically kept. If it’s anything less, the probability the sampler keeps a given trace is determined by the target percent. For example, the default target percent is 1 for random traces, so 1% of those traces are kept. If you prefer, you can change the random filter percentage. Because the trace observer uses percentages of throughput, the number of traces selected will vary with that throughput. No sampling Some of our tools don't use sampling. Sampling details for these tools: Browser and mobile trace reporting Browser monitoring distributed tracing and mobile monitoring report all spans. Our APM language agents are often used in conjunction with browser and mobile monitoring, and our language agents use sampling. This means that there will likely be many more browser and mobile spans than back-end spans, which can result in browser and mobile app spans disconnected from back-end spans. For tips on querying for traces that contain front and back-end spans, see Find browser span data. Trace API If you don't have Infinite Tracing enabled, our Trace API does no sampling (unless the default data limits are exceeded). It's expected that you set up the Trace API to send us the traces you think are important. How trace data is structured Understanding the structure of a distributed trace can help you: Understand how traces are displayed in our UI Help you query trace data A distributed trace has a tree-like structure, with \"child\" spans that refer to one \"parent\" span. This diagram shows some important span relationships in a trace: This diagram shows how spans in a distributed trace relate to each other. This diagram shows several important concepts: Trace root. The first service or process in a trace is referred to as the root service or process. Process boundaries. A process represents the execution of a logical piece of code. Examples of a process include a backend service or Lambda function. Spans within a process are categorized as one of the following: Entry span: the first span in a process. Exit span: a span is a considered an exit span if it a) is the parent of an entry span, or b) has http. or db. attributes and therefore represents an external call. In-process span: a span that represents an internal method call or function and that is not an exit or entry span. Client spans. A client span represents a call to another entity or external dependency. Currently, there are two client span types: Datastore. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with db. (like db.statement), it's categorized as a datastore span. External. If a client span has any attributes prefixed with http. (like http.url) or has a child span in another process, it's categorized as an external span. This is a general category for any external calls that are not datastore queries. Trace duration. A trace's total duration is determined by the length of time from the start of the earliest span to the completion of the last span. You can query span relationship data with the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. How trace data is stored Understanding how we store trace data can help you query your trace data. We save trace data as: Span: A span represents operations that are part of a distributed trace. The operations that a span can represent include browser-side interactions, datastore queries, calls to other services, method-level timing, and Lambda functions. One example: in an HTTP service, a span is created at the start of an HTTP request and completed when the HTTP server returns a response. Span attributes contain important information about that operation (such as duration, host data, etc.), including trace-relationship details (such as traceId, guid). For span-related data, see span attributes. Transaction: If an entity in a trace is monitored by an agent, a request to that entity generates a single Transaction event. Transactions allow trace data to be tied to other New Relic features. For transaction-related data, see transaction attributes. Contextual metadata. We store metadata that shows calculations about a trace and the relationships between its spans. To query this data, use the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. How trace context is passed between applications We support the W3C Trace Context standard, which makes it easier to trace transactions across networks and services. When you enable distributed tracing, New Relic agents add HTTP headers to a service's outbound requests. HTTP headers act like passports on an international trip: They identify your software traces and carry important information as they travel through various networks, processes, and security systems. The headers also contain information that helps us link the spans together later: metadata like the trace ID, span ID, the New Relic account ID, and sampling information. See the table below for more details on the header: Item Description accountId This is your New Relic account ID. However, only those on your account and New Relic Admins can associate this Id with your account information in any way. appId This is the application ID of the application generating the trace header. Much like accountId, this identifier is not going to provide any information unless you're a user on the account. guid With Distributed Tracing, each segment of work in a trace is represented by a span, and each span has a guid attribute. The guid of the last span within the process is sent with the outgoing request so that the first segment of work in the receiving service can add this guid as the parentId attribute which connects data within the trace. Parent type The source of the trace header, as in mobile, browser, Ruby app, etc. This becomes the parent.type attribute on the transaction triggered by the request this header is attached to. Priority A randomly generated priority ranking value that helps determine which data is sampled when sampling limits are reached. This is a float value set by the first New Relic agent that’s part of the request so all data in the trace will have the same priority value. Sampled A boolean value that tells the agent if traced data should be collected for the request. This is also added as an attribute on any span and transaction data collected. If you want to read more about this sampling process, this guide goes into more detail. Timestamp Unix timestamp in milliseconds when the payload was created. traceId The unique ID (a randomly generated string) used to identify a single request as it crosses inter- and intra- process boundaries. This ID allows the linking of spans in a distributed trace. This also is added as an attribute on the span and transaction data. transactionId The unique identifier for the transaction event. Trusted acount key This is a key that helps identify any other accounts associated with your account. So if you have multiple sub-accounts that the trace crosses, we can confirm that any data included in the trace is coming from a trusted source, and tells us what users should have access to the data. Version and data key This identifies major/minor versions, so if an agent receives a trace header from a version with breaking changes from the one it is on, it can reject that header and report the rejection and reason. This header information is passed along each span of a trace, unless the progress is stopped by something like middleware or agents that don't recognize the header format (see Figure 1). Figure 1 To address the problem of header propagation, we support the W3C Trace Context specification that requires two standardized headers. Our latest W3C New Relic agents send and receive these two required headers, and by default, they also send and receive the header of the prior New Relic agent: W3C (traceparent): The primary header that identifies the entire trace (trace ID) and the calling service (span id). W3C (tracestate): A required header that carries vendor-specific information and tracks where a trace has been. New Relic (newrelic): The original, proprietary header that is still sent to maintain backward compatibility with prior New Relic agents. This combination of three headers allows traces to be propagated across services instrumented with these types of agents: W3C New Relic agents Non-W3C New Relic agents W3C Trace Context-compatible agents Important If your requests only touch W3C Trace Context-compatible agents, you can opt to turn off the New Relic header. See the agent configuration documentation for details about turning off the newrelic header. The scenarios below show various types of successful header propagation. Scenario 1: Trace touching three agent types This shows the flow of headers when a request touches three different agent types: Scenario 2: Trace with W3C New Relic and middleware This shows the combination of headers sent by a W3C New Relic agent to some middleware. Scenario 3: Trace with any W3C-compliant agent and a New Relic agent. This shows the two required W3C headers from another vendor accepted by a W3C New Relic agent.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see that trace's timeline and spans: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Monitor > Distributed tracing > (select a trace) > (select a span): See the spans in a trace. Examine individual span details and see notifications for spans with anomalous behavior. The UI indicates some span properties with icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an exception is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span exception This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in exceptions An exception that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the exception is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an exception is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

      "body": "Problem You have enabled distributed tracing but data you expected to see does not appear in New Relic's distributed tracing UI. Solution Important Before performing troubleshooting, we recommend reading How distributed tracing works. Here are some causes and solutions when you have problems finding expected data in the distributed tracing UI: Problems with enabling or instrumenting Missing spans due to service not having distributed tracing enabled In order for distributed tracing to report details for all nodes in a trace, each application must be monitored by a New Relic agent that has had distributed tracing enabled. If an application's New Relic account has not had distributed tracing enabled, it will have these issues: Its distributed tracing UI page won't have data. It won't report data to other accounts' distributed traces. Missing apps/services may require manual instrumentation When you enable distributed tracing for applications and services that New Relic automatically instruments, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some services or applications are missing from traces, or that there are some internal spans you expect to see that are missing. If that's the case, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the New Relic agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the New Relic agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application. Problems with spans Infinite Tracing: missing spans If your APM agent can’t write data fast enough to the trace observer, queue_size is an additional APM agent configuration to limit the number of spans the agent will hold. See the following examples for your agent: .NET configuration method Example Configuration file <configuration . . . > <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer> <span_events queue_size=\"100000\" /> </trace_observer> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy Environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_EVENTS_QUEUE_SIZE=100000 Copy Python configuration method Example Configuration file infinite_tracing.span_queue_size = 100000 Environment Variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000 Missing span not getting exported Sometimes header propagation is successful, but the span information isn't getting sent to New Relic. For example, if OpenTelemetry is not instrumented with a New Relic exporter, the span details never make it to New Relic. In this diagram, notice that the header propagation is successful, but no exporter is set up in Service 2 to send the span to New Relic: The following diagram also shows successful header propagation, but it includes an exporter in Service 2 that sends the span details to New Relic (see Trace API): Missing spans due to sampling process Standard distributed tracing for APM uses adaptive sampling. This means that a percentage of calls to a service will be reported as part of a distributed trace. Specific calls to your service might not have been selected to be sampled. Missing spans due to span limits maxed out There are limits on the number of spans that can be collected and displayed. If an application generates a very large number of spans for a single call, it might exceed the APM agent's span-collection limit for that harvest cycle. This could result in missing spans and significantly limit the number of traces the agent can completely sample and report. We currently only show 10,000 spans at a time. Missing spans due to spans being sent late Spans must be sent within the last twenty minutes to be captured in a trace index. If you send any spans older than twenty minutes but newer than a day, the span data will still be written. However, it won't be rolled into the trace index, which controls the trace list in the distributed tracing UI. If a span has a timestamp older than a day, it will be dropped. This often occurs when there is clock skew (timing differences) between systems or long running background jobs. Problems with trace details Middleware doesn't recognize proprietary New Relic header If your transactions are only sending the proprietary New Relic header, some middleware might not recognize the format and then drop the information as shown in this diagram: One solution is to upgrade your New Relic agent to a version that supports W3C trace context. In the diagram below, the W3C-compliant New Relic agent passes the prior header along with two standardized headers: An intermediary is missing or isn't passing trace context Some potential problems with proxies and other intermediaries: Incomplete trace. Some intermediaries won't automatically propagate the distributed tracing header. In that case, you must configure that component to allow the header to be passed from source to destination. For instructions, consult the documentation for that intermediary component. Missing intermediary in trace. If the intermediary is New Relic-monitored, ensure that it propagates the newrelic header that is generated or updated by the New Relic agent running on that intermediary. This may manifest when an intermediary was previously visible in traces, but disappeared after distributed tracing was enabled for an upstream entity (for example, a browser-monitored application). Tip If some entities report trace data to another tracing system, you can use the trace ID from the New Relic UI to search other tracing systems for missing spans. Stitching together spans from mixed sources If each agent in a chain supports W3C Trace Context, then we can stitch the spans together into a complete trace. If part of the chain is from an agent, such as Zipkin, which doesn't support W3C Trace Context, then spans coming from that agent may not be included in the trace. Trace details are obfuscated If a trace contains data from applications monitored by multiple New Relic accounts, and your user permissions don't allow you to access those accounts, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. For example, you may see a series of asterisks ( * * * * * ) instead of the service name in your distributed tracing list if you don't have access to the account linked with the service. Trace list information and trace details don't match The trace list is generated by trace indexes, which are captured in a twenty minute window from when the first spans are received. Usually, this is due to late spans. Long traces with short backend times If you're seeing unusually short backend times for long traces, this is likely an issue with the timestamps being sent. For example, the root span might be reposting microseconds as milliseconds. This can also happen if the root span is a browser application. When using an external client like a web browser, you may experience clock skew (timing differences) more often. Problems with browser applications Missing spans and transactions after enabling for a browser application Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If the browser application makes an AJAX request to an APM application running an incompatible agent, then the APM agent may not record transaction and span data for that request. If distributed tracing is enabled for a browser application and you are not seeing transaction or span data for downstream APM requests, review the browser data in distributed tracing requirements, and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. Not seeing browser app end-user spans If traces seem to be missing end-user spans, be sure you've read and understand the browser distributed tracing requirements and enable procedures. On the AJAX UI page, there are links to the distributed tracing UI regardless of whether there are end-user spans present in that trace. For details about what data generates spans, see Requirements. Browser spans are not connected to other spans Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If APM spans are missing consistently from traces that include browser applications, please refer to the browser data in distributed tracing requirements and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. For other causes of orphaned browser spans, see Browser span reporting.

      "body": "If you are new to New Relic distributed tracing, we recommend you read the following before you enable distributed tracing. Impact to APM features Our distributed tracing improves on APM's previous cross application tracing feature. Here are some key benefits: See more cross-service activity details and more complete end-to-end traces. Filter and query traces, as well as make custom charts. See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Distributed tracing helps you monitor and analyze the behavior of your distributed system. After you enable distributed tracing, you can use our UI tools to search for traces and analyze them. For example, let's say you are an engineer troubleshooting errors in a complex transaction spanning many services. Here's what you can do in our UI: Open the distributed tracing UI page. Sort through your traces using a filter to find that specific request and show only traces containing errors. On the trace details page, you review the span along the request route that originated the error. Noting the error class and message, navigate to the service from its span in the trace so you can see that the error is occurring at a high rate. Read on to explore the options in the distributed tracing UI. Open the distributed tracing UI Here's how you can access the distributed tracing UI, depending on the type of search you want to do: View traces for a specific service The New Relic Explorer and APM are two menu options that help you navigate to a specific service so you can see traces that include that service. Go to one.newrelic.com. Click Explorer or APM in the top menu bar. Filter to the service you enabled for distributed tracing by typing the service name, and then press Enter. In the left navigation's Monitor section, click Distributed tracing. View traces across all accounts If you want to view traces from across all accounts you have access to, go to one.newrelic.com, click Browse data, and then Traces. Tip If you don't have access to accounts for some services in a trace, we'll obfuscate some details for those services. Find traces that are useful We have a variety of tools to help you find traces and spans so you can resolve issues. The opening distributed tracing page is populated with a default list of traces, and you can quickly refine this list using these tools: Query bar Trace groups Scatter plot chart Filters Interactive histograms Tip In addition to these tools, you can also use other options mentioned in Query distributed trace data. Filter using the query bar The Find traces query bar is a quick way to narrow your search for traces. You can either start typing in the query bar or use the dropdown to create a compound query. Query returns are based on span attributes, not on trace attributes. You define spans that have certain criteria, and the search displays traces that contain those spans. If you use a multi-attribute filter, it is affected by first attribute selected. Distributed tracing reports on two types of data: transaction events and spans. When you select an attribute in the filter, the data type that attribute is attached to dictates the available attributes. For example, if you filter on an attribute that is attached to a transaction event, only transaction event attributes are available when you attempt to add filter on additional attribute values. Queries for traces are similar to NRQL (our query language). Here are the main exceptions: String values don't require quote marks (for example, you can use either appName = MyApp or appName = 'MyApp') The like operator doesn’t require % (for example, you can use either appName like product or appName like %product%). Tip Some queries that return a large number of results may return false positives. The trace list limits these incorrect results to 10% of the returned results. False positives may also result in histogram chart results that are not displayed in the trace list. Here are two query bar examples: Find traces that touch two services The query in the image below finds traces that: Pass through both WebPortal and Inventory Service applications Have an Inventory Service datastore call that takes longer than 500 ms Contains an error in any span. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Find error spans using the like operator The query in the image below finds traces that: Contain spans that pass through the WebPortal application and where an error occurred on any span in the WebPortal application Contain spans where the customer_user_email attribute contains a value ending with hotmail.com anywhere in the trace. Go to one.newrelic.com > Apps > Distributed tracing Trace groups The default view of distributed tracing shows traces grouped by the same root entry span. In other words, traces are grouped by the span where New Relic began recording the request. You can slide the toggle Group similar traces to turn this on and off. With trace groups you get a high-level view of traces so you can understand request behavior for groups of similar traces. This helps you understand dips or spikes in trace count, duration, and errors. When you click on one of the trace groups, you get all the standard details in context of the specific trace group you selected. Filter using the scatter plot The trace scatter plot is a quick way to search for outlying traces. This is available on the opening page of distributed tracing if you turn off the Group similar traces toggle at the top of the page. In the scatter plot, you can move the cursor across the chart to view trace details and you can click individual points to get details: Here's how you can control what's displayed in the scatter plot: In the View by dropdown, select the duration type: Back-end duration Root span duration Trace duration In Group traces by, select one of these options: Errors: Group by whether or not traces contain errors. Root service: Group by the name of the first service in traces. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root service would be Service A. Root entry span: Group by the root transaction, which is the root service's endpoint. In a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, the root entry span is Service A's endpoint. For example: \"Service A - GET /user/%\". Service entry span: Group by the span name of the service currently being viewed in APM. For example, for a trace where Service A calls Service B and Service B calls Service C, if you're viewing Service B in APM and select this grouping, the traces will be represented by their Service B span names. If a service has multiple spans in a trace, this grouping option will use that service's first entry point. Filters In the left pane, you can filter traces by multi-span traces, specific entities, or error types. Once you select a filter, only traces associated with that specific type are displayed. This makes it much easier to view the traces you're most interested in so you can find and fix issues faster. Trace histograms The histogram charts give you a quick understanding of trace distribution for important values, such as duration. Click Show filters at the bottom of the left pane to display the histograms. When you move the histogram sliders, they change the data displayed in the scatterplot or the trace group charts. For example, you can drag the Trace duration chart slider to show only traces over 500 ms, as shown in the histogram example below. Important Some queries that produce many results may result in false positives in histograms. This could manifest as histograms showing trace results that are not in the trace list. Trace details UI page When you select a trace from the trace list, you see that trace's timeline and spans: one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Monitor > Distributed tracing > (select a trace) > (select a span): See the spans in a trace. Examine individual span details and see notifications for spans with anomalous behavior. The UI indicates some span properties with icons: Span property Indicator Description Service This icon represents a span that's a service's entry point. In-process This icon represents an in-process span, which is a span that takes place within a process (as opposed to a cross-process span). Examples: middleware instrumentation, user-created spans. Datastore This icon represents a span call to a datastore. External This icon represents category representing a call to an external service made via HTTP. Browser app This icon represents a browser application span. Lambda This icon represents a span from a Lambda function. Some spans will have additional indicators: Span property Indicator Description Type of connection Solid lines indicate a direct parent-child relationship; in other words, one process or function directly calling another. A dotted line indicates a non-direct relationship. For more on relationships between spans, see Trace structure. Errors A span with an error. See How to understand span errors. Anomalous This icon represents the detection of an anomalous span. Orphaned spans Some spans may be \"orphaned,\" or separated, from the trace. These spans will appear at the bottom of the trace. For more details, see Fragmented traces. Multiple app names When beside a span name, this represents an entity that has had multiple app names set. Select this to see all app names it reports to. To search trace data by alternate app names, use the appName attribute. Client/server time difference If a span's duration indicator is not completely colored in (like in this example), it means that there is a time discrepancy between the server-side duration and the client-side duration for that activity. For details on this, see Client/server time difference. For more on the trace structure and how span properties are determined, see Trace structure. Span details pane When you select a span, a pane opens up with span details. These details can be helpful for troubleshooting performance issues. Details include: Performance charts Span attributes The span's data source Anomalous span details The span's full name What a span displays is based on its span type. For example, a datastore span's name attribute will contain the datastore query. View related logs If you are using our logs in context feature together with our log management, you can see any logs that are linked to your traces: Go to the trace details page by clicking on a trace. Click See logs in the upper-right corner. For details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message. Additional UI details Here are some additional distributed tracing UI details, rules, and limits: How to understand span errors Span-level errors show you where errors originated in a process, how they bubbled up, and where they were handled. Every span that ends with an exception is shown with an error in the UI and contributes to the total error count for that trace. Here are some general tips about understanding span errors: Spans with errors are highlighted red in the distributed tracing UI. You can see more information on the Error Details pane for each span. All spans that exit with errors are counted in the span error count. When multiple errors occur on the same span, only one is written to the span in this order of precedence: A noticeError The most recent span exception This table describes how different span errors are handled: Error type Description Spans ending in exceptions An exception that leaves the boundary of a span results in an error on that span and on any ancestor spans that also exit with an error, until the exception is caught or exits the transaction. You can see if an exception is caught in an ancestor span. Notice errors Errors noticed by calls to the agent noticeError API or by the automatic agent instrumentation are attached to the currently executing span. Response code errors Response code errors are attached to the associated span, such as: Client span: External transactions prefixed with http or db. Entry span: In the case of a transaction ending in a response code error. The response code for these spans is captured as an attribute httpResponseCode and attached to that span. Anomalous spans If a span is displayed as anomalous in the UI, it means that the following are both true: The span is more than two standard deviations slower than the average of all spans with the same name from the same service over the last six hours. The span's duration is more than 10% of the trace's duration. Client span duration: time differences between client and server spans When a process calls another process, and both processes are instrumented by New Relic, the trace contains both a client-side representation of the call and a server-side representation. The client span (calling process) can have time-related differences when compared to the server span (called process). These differences could be due to: Clock skew, due to system clock time differences Differences in duration, due to things like network latency or DNS resolution delay The UI shows these time-related differences by displaying an outline of the client span in the same space as the server span. This span represents the duration of the client span. It isn't possible to determine every factor contributing to these time-related discrepancies, but here are some common span patterns and tips for understanding them: When a client span is longer than the server span, this could be due to latency in a number of areas, such as: network time, queue time, DNS resolution time, or from a load balancer that we cannot see. When a client span starts and ends before a server span begins, this could be due to clock skew, or due to the server doing asynchronous work that continues after sending the response. When a client span starts after a server span, this is most likely clock skew. Fragmented traces Fragmented traces are traces with missing spans. When a span is missing or has invalid parent span IDs, its children spans become separated from the rest of the trace, which we refer to as \"orphaned.\" Orphaned spans appear at the bottom of the trace, and they will lack connecting lines to the rest of the trace. Types of orphaned span properties indicated in the UI: No root span. Missing the root span, which is the first operation in the request. When this happens, the span with the earliest timestamp is displayed as the root. Orphaned span. A single span with a missing parent span. This could be due to the parent span having an ID that doesn't match its child span. Orphaned trace fragment. A group of connected spans where the first span in the group is an orphan span. This can happen for a number of reasons, including: Collection limits. Some high-throughput applications may exceed collection limits (for example, APM agent collection limits, or API limits). When this happens, it may result in traces having missing spans. One way to remedy this is to turn off some reporting, so that the limit is not reached. Incorrect instrumentation. If an application is instrumented incorrectly, it won't pass trace context correctly and this will result in fragmented traces. To remedy this, examine the data source that is generating orphan spans to ensure instrumentation is done correctly. To discover a span's data source, select it and examine its span details. Spans still arriving. If some parent spans haven't been collected yet, this can result in temporary gaps until the entire trace has reported. UI display limits. Orphaned spans may result if a trace exceeds the 10K span display limit. Trace details obfuscated based on account access If you don’t have access to the New Relic accounts that monitor other services, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. Obfuscation can include: Span name concealed by asterisks Service name replaced with New Relic account ID and app ID For more information on the factors affecting your access to accounts, see Account access. Span limits and sampling See Sampling. Incomplete span names in waterfall view When viewing the span waterfall, span names may be displayed in an incomplete form that is more human-readable than the complete span name. To find the complete name, select that span and look for the Full span name. Knowing the complete name can be valuable for querying that data with NRQL. Missing spans and span/service count discrepancies A trace may sometimes have (or seem to have) missing spans or services. This can manifest as a discrepancy between the count of a trace's spans or services displayed in the trace list and the count displayed on the trace details page. Reasons for missing spans and count discrepancies include: An APM agent may have hit its 1K span collection limit. A span may be initially counted but not make it into a trace display, for reasons such as network latency or a query issue. The UI may have hit its 10K span display limit. All spans collected, including those not displayed, can be queried with NRQL.",

      "body": "Problem You have enabled distributed tracing but data you expected to see does not appear in New Relic's distributed tracing UI. Solution Important Before performing troubleshooting, we recommend reading How distributed tracing works. Here are some causes and solutions when you have problems finding expected data in the distributed tracing UI: Problems with enabling or instrumenting Missing spans due to service not having distributed tracing enabled In order for distributed tracing to report details for all nodes in a trace, each application must be monitored by a New Relic agent that has had distributed tracing enabled. If an application's New Relic account has not had distributed tracing enabled, it will have these issues: Its distributed tracing UI page won't have data. It won't report data to other accounts' distributed traces. Missing apps/services may require manual instrumentation When you enable distributed tracing for applications and services that New Relic automatically instruments, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some services or applications are missing from traces, or that there are some internal spans you expect to see that are missing. If that's the case, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the New Relic agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the New Relic agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application. Problems with spans Infinite Tracing: missing spans If your APM agent can’t write data fast enough to the trace observer, queue_size is an additional APM agent configuration to limit the number of spans the agent will hold. See the following examples for your agent: .NET configuration method Example Configuration file <configuration . . . > <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer> <span_events queue_size=\"100000\" /> </trace_observer> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy Environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_EVENTS_QUEUE_SIZE=100000 Copy Python configuration method Example Configuration file infinite_tracing.span_queue_size = 100000 Environment Variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000 Missing span not getting exported Sometimes header propagation is successful, but the span information isn't getting sent to New Relic. For example, if OpenTelemetry is not instrumented with a New Relic exporter, the span details never make it to New Relic. In this diagram, notice that the header propagation is successful, but no exporter is set up in Service 2 to send the span to New Relic: The following diagram also shows successful header propagation, but it includes an exporter in Service 2 that sends the span details to New Relic (see Trace API): Missing spans due to sampling process Standard distributed tracing for APM uses adaptive sampling. This means that a percentage of calls to a service will be reported as part of a distributed trace. Specific calls to your service might not have been selected to be sampled. Missing spans due to span limits maxed out There are limits on the number of spans that can be collected and displayed. If an application generates a very large number of spans for a single call, it might exceed the APM agent's span-collection limit for that harvest cycle. This could result in missing spans and significantly limit the number of traces the agent can completely sample and report. We currently only show 10,000 spans at a time. Missing spans due to spans being sent late Spans must be sent within the last twenty minutes to be captured in a trace index. If you send any spans older than twenty minutes but newer than a day, the span data will still be written. However, it won't be rolled into the trace index, which controls the trace list in the distributed tracing UI. If a span has a timestamp older than a day, it will be dropped. This often occurs when there is clock skew (timing differences) between systems or long running background jobs. Problems with trace details Middleware doesn't recognize proprietary New Relic header If your transactions are only sending the proprietary New Relic header, some middleware might not recognize the format and then drop the information as shown in this diagram: One solution is to upgrade your New Relic agent to a version that supports W3C trace context. In the diagram below, the W3C-compliant New Relic agent passes the prior header along with two standardized headers: An intermediary is missing or isn't passing trace context Some potential problems with proxies and other intermediaries: Incomplete trace. Some intermediaries won't automatically propagate the distributed tracing header. In that case, you must configure that component to allow the header to be passed from source to destination. For instructions, consult the documentation for that intermediary component. Missing intermediary in trace. If the intermediary is New Relic-monitored, ensure that it propagates the newrelic header that is generated or updated by the New Relic agent running on that intermediary. This may manifest when an intermediary was previously visible in traces, but disappeared after distributed tracing was enabled for an upstream entity (for example, a browser-monitored application). Tip If some entities report trace data to another tracing system, you can use the trace ID from the New Relic UI to search other tracing systems for missing spans. Stitching together spans from mixed sources If each agent in a chain supports W3C Trace Context, then we can stitch the spans together into a complete trace. If part of the chain is from an agent, such as Zipkin, which doesn't support W3C Trace Context, then spans coming from that agent may not be included in the trace. Trace details are obfuscated If a trace contains data from applications monitored by multiple New Relic accounts, and your user permissions don't allow you to access those accounts, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. For example, you may see a series of asterisks ( * * * * * ) instead of the service name in your distributed tracing list if you don't have access to the account linked with the service. Trace list information and trace details don't match The trace list is generated by trace indexes, which are captured in a twenty minute window from when the first spans are received. Usually, this is due to late spans. Long traces with short backend times If you're seeing unusually short backend times for long traces, this is likely an issue with the timestamps being sent. For example, the root span might be reposting microseconds as milliseconds. This can also happen if the root span is a browser application. When using an external client like a web browser, you may experience clock skew (timing differences) more often. Problems with browser applications Missing spans and transactions after enabling for a browser application Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If the browser application makes an AJAX request to an APM application running an incompatible agent, then the APM agent may not record transaction and span data for that request. If distributed tracing is enabled for a browser application and you are not seeing transaction or span data for downstream APM requests, review the browser data in distributed tracing requirements, and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. Not seeing browser app end-user spans If traces seem to be missing end-user spans, be sure you've read and understand the browser distributed tracing requirements and enable procedures. On the AJAX UI page, there are links to the distributed tracing UI regardless of whether there are end-user spans present in that trace. For details about what data generates spans, see Requirements. Browser spans are not connected to other spans Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If APM spans are missing consistently from traces that include browser applications, please refer to the browser data in distributed tracing requirements and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. For other causes of orphaned browser spans, see Browser span reporting. Other problems Search by entity.name not finding associated app names Potential cause: For applications that have multiple app names, the entity.name attribute will be associated only with the primary app name. To search by other app names, search using the appName attribute. Supporting OpenTelemetry Questions about integrating with OpenTelemetry should be taken to the Explorers Hub.",

See the complete trace even when calls cross an organization's account boundaries. See Introduction to distributed tracing for more features. Enabling distributed tracing may affect some APM features you currently use. These changes affect only applications monitored by agents that have distributed tracing enabled—they don't apply on an account-level. We may provide backward compatibility with some or all of the affected features in future releases. For now, you should understand the following changes before enabling distributed tracing: External services page has less detail When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, external calls do not have internal transaction details at one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > External services > (select external service). To find that information, you would instead go to the Distributed tracing UI page, find the external call URLs, and see what their child spans are. Transaction trace UI displays service URLs, not transaction links When distributed tracing is enabled for an application, the transaction trace UI will no longer have the transaction name and link for the called service (see screenshot below). This will be replaced with the called service's URL. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace): This shows the transaction trace UI before distributed tracing is enabled, with a link to the associated transaction. With distributed tracing enabled, it will display the service's URL. If you wanted to get more detail about trace activity, you would go to the Distributed tracing UI page and examine that trace. Cross-application tracing will be disabled Enabling distributed tracing will disable the cross application tracing feature. Distributed tracing is an improved version of cross-application tracing and only one can be enabled at a time. Impacts related to mobile monitoring APM-related impacts include: When distributed tracing is enabled for an APM-monitored entity, legacy service maps will not show applications monitored by mobile. The App server drill-down feature of the legacy mobile HTTP requests UI page is not available. Plan your rollout If you're enabling distributed tracing for a large, distributed system, here are some tips: If you are a current APM user, see Impact to APM features. Determine the requests that are the most important for your business, or the most likely to require analysis and troubleshooting, and enable distributed tracing for those services. Enable tracing for services at roughly the same time so you can more easily gauge how complete your end-to-end traces are. When you look at traces in the distributed tracing UI, you'll see spans in the trace for external calls to other services. Then, you can enable distributed tracing for any of those services you want. If a service is fairly standalone and not often used in context with other services, you may not want to enable distributed tracing for it. Here's a visual representation of such a phased roll-out: If you are using APM for a large, monolithic service, there may be many sub-process spans per trace and APM limits may result in fewer traces than expected. You can solve this by using APM agent instrumentation to disable the reporting of unimportant data. Distributed tracing works by propagating header information from service to service in a request path. Some services may communicate through a proxy or other intermediary service that does not automatically propagate the header. In that case, you will need to configure that proxy so that it allows the newrelic header value to be propagated from source to destination. Enable distributed tracing If you are aware of the impact to APM features and have thought about your rollout, you are ready to set up distributed tracing. See Overview: Enable distributed tracing.",

      "body": "Problem You have enabled distributed tracing but data you expected to see does not appear in New Relic's distributed tracing UI. Solution Important Before performing troubleshooting, we recommend reading How distributed tracing works. Here are some causes and solutions when you have problems finding expected data in the distributed tracing UI: Problems with enabling or instrumenting Missing spans due to service not having distributed tracing enabled In order for distributed tracing to report details for all nodes in a trace, each application must be monitored by a New Relic agent that has had distributed tracing enabled. If an application's New Relic account has not had distributed tracing enabled, it will have these issues: Its distributed tracing UI page won't have data. It won't report data to other accounts' distributed traces. Missing apps/services may require manual instrumentation When you enable distributed tracing for applications and services that New Relic automatically instruments, you'll usually see complete and detailed data for those nodes in the distributed tracing UI. However, you may notice that some services or applications are missing from traces, or that there are some internal spans you expect to see that are missing. If that's the case, you may want to implement custom instrumentation of applications or specific transactions to see more detail in traces. Some examples of when you may need to do this: Transactions not automatically instrumented. To ensure your application is automatically instrumented, read the compatibility and requirements documentation for the New Relic agent you're using. If an application isn't automatically instrumented, or if you'd like to add instrumentation of specific activity, see Custom instrumentation. All Go applications. The Go agent, unlike other agents, requires manual instrumentation of your code. For instructions, see Instrument a Go application. A service doesn't use HTTP. If a service doesn't communicate via HTTP, the New Relic agent won't send distributed tracing headers. This may be the case for some non-web applications or message queues. To remedy this, use the distributed tracing APIs to instrument either the calling or called application. Problems with spans Infinite Tracing: missing spans If your APM agent can’t write data fast enough to the trace observer, queue_size is an additional APM agent configuration to limit the number of spans the agent will hold. See the following examples for your agent: .NET configuration method Example Configuration file <configuration . . . > <infiniteTracing> <trace_observer> <span_events queue_size=\"100000\" /> </trace_observer> </infiniteTracing> </configuration> Copy Environment variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_EVENTS_QUEUE_SIZE=100000 Copy Python configuration method Example Configuration file infinite_tracing.span_queue_size = 100000 Environment Variable NEW_RELIC_INFINITE_TRACING_SPAN_QUEUE_SIZE = 100000 Missing span not getting exported Sometimes header propagation is successful, but the span information isn't getting sent to New Relic. For example, if OpenTelemetry is not instrumented with a New Relic exporter, the span details never make it to New Relic. In this diagram, notice that the header propagation is successful, but no exporter is set up in Service 2 to send the span to New Relic: The following diagram also shows successful header propagation, but it includes an exporter in Service 2 that sends the span details to New Relic (see Trace API): Missing spans due to sampling process Standard distributed tracing for APM uses adaptive sampling. This means that a percentage of calls to a service will be reported as part of a distributed trace. Specific calls to your service might not have been selected to be sampled. Missing spans due to span limits maxed out There are limits on the number of spans that can be collected and displayed. If an application generates a very large number of spans for a single call, it might exceed the APM agent's span-collection limit for that harvest cycle. This could result in missing spans and significantly limit the number of traces the agent can completely sample and report. We currently only show 10,000 spans at a time. Missing spans due to spans being sent late Spans must be sent within the last twenty minutes to be captured in a trace index. If you send any spans older than twenty minutes but newer than a day, the span data will still be written. However, it won't be rolled into the trace index, which controls the trace list in the distributed tracing UI. If a span has a timestamp older than a day, it will be dropped. This often occurs when there is clock skew (timing differences) between systems or long running background jobs. Problems with trace details Middleware doesn't recognize proprietary New Relic header If your transactions are only sending the proprietary New Relic header, some middleware might not recognize the format and then drop the information as shown in this diagram: One solution is to upgrade your New Relic agent to a version that supports W3C trace context. In the diagram below, the W3C-compliant New Relic agent passes the prior header along with two standardized headers: An intermediary is missing or isn't passing trace context Some potential problems with proxies and other intermediaries: Incomplete trace. Some intermediaries won't automatically propagate the distributed tracing header. In that case, you must configure that component to allow the header to be passed from source to destination. For instructions, consult the documentation for that intermediary component. Missing intermediary in trace. If the intermediary is New Relic-monitored, ensure that it propagates the newrelic header that is generated or updated by the New Relic agent running on that intermediary. This may manifest when an intermediary was previously visible in traces, but disappeared after distributed tracing was enabled for an upstream entity (for example, a browser-monitored application). Tip If some entities report trace data to another tracing system, you can use the trace ID from the New Relic UI to search other tracing systems for missing spans. Stitching together spans from mixed sources If each agent in a chain supports W3C Trace Context, then we can stitch the spans together into a complete trace. If part of the chain is from an agent, such as Zipkin, which doesn't support W3C Trace Context, then spans coming from that agent may not be included in the trace. Trace details are obfuscated If a trace contains data from applications monitored by multiple New Relic accounts, and your user permissions don't allow you to access those accounts, some of the span and service details will be obfuscated in the UI. For example, you may see a series of asterisks ( * * * * * ) instead of the service name in your distributed tracing list if you don't have access to the account linked with the service. Trace list information and trace details don't match The trace list is generated by trace indexes, which are captured in a twenty minute window from when the first spans are received. Usually, this is due to late spans. Long traces with short backend times If you're seeing unusually short backend times for long traces, this is likely an issue with the timestamps being sent. For example, the root span might be reposting microseconds as milliseconds. This can also happen if the root span is a browser application. When using an external client like a web browser, you may experience clock skew (timing differences) more often. Problems with browser applications Missing spans and transactions after enabling for a browser application Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If the browser application makes an AJAX request to an APM application running an incompatible agent, then the APM agent may not record transaction and span data for that request. If distributed tracing is enabled for a browser application and you are not seeing transaction or span data for downstream APM requests, review the browser data in distributed tracing requirements, and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. Not seeing browser app end-user spans If traces seem to be missing end-user spans, be sure you've read and understand the browser distributed tracing requirements and enable procedures. On the AJAX UI page, there are links to the distributed tracing UI regardless of whether there are end-user spans present in that trace. For details about what data generates spans, see Requirements. Browser spans are not connected to other spans Older versions of some APM agents are incompatible with distributed tracing for browser applications. If APM spans are missing consistently from traces that include browser applications, please refer to the browser data in distributed tracing requirements and confirm that all applications are running supported versions of the APM agent. For other causes of orphaned browser spans, see Browser span reporting. Other problems Search by entity.name not finding associated app names Potential cause: For applications that have multiple app names, the entity.name attribute will be associated only with the primary app name. To search by other app names, search using the appName attribute. Supporting OpenTelemetry Questions about integrating with OpenTelemetry should be taken to the Explorers Hub.",

      "body": "Here is information about using the legacy APM service maps feature to create, customize, and use service maps. For help using the current service maps feature, see How to use service maps. Requirements The legacy service map features in APM depend on your New Relic agent version: Feature Requirements App visibility For your app to appear in service maps, one of the following must be true: Your app must have the minimum agent version required for distributed tracing and have distributed tracing enabled. Note: Mobile monitoring doesn't support distributed tracing yet and will not show relationships to apps that have distributed tracing enabled. Your app must have the minimum APM agent version required for cross app tracing and have cross app tracing enabled. Host and instance visibility To view specific hosts, instances, and types of database information, your agent must meet the same minimum agent versions as the APM database and instance feature and use any of the compatible database drivers. Database-only visibility APM's service maps feature includes the ability to opt out of the deeper, host and instance level view. However, to view databases in service maps without the instance-level details, you must still meet the same minimum agent versions as the Database and slow queries features. Create maps The APM service maps feature helps you create your first map by providing default map or architecture suggestions that automatically build a default map (if you have more than ten reporting apps). To view these suggested maps, go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service Maps > Suggested maps. To create a new map: Do one of the following: Start from scratch: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Create new map . Copy an existing map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > Save as new. Name your map. Rearrange, group, or add nodes on the map as needed. Important Previously, you could have private service maps. Now, all users can view, edit, and delete all existing or new service maps in the account. Save and rename maps Here are some tips about saving and renaming maps: Save To save changes to a map, select Save. To create a copy of the current map, select Save as new. Rename To rename a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the pencil icon next to the map name. Change the name, then select Save. Add or remove nodes on maps After you create or save a map, build out your map by adding nodes to it. Nodes are added to the map differently based on the node type. To remove any node from the map, mouse over the node, then select the remove X icon. Applications and mobile apps Nodes for applications or mobile apps need to be added to the map in order to add any other nodes. Nodes are added and connected into the map as you select them. The check mark icon means that node is already on the map. To add New Relic monitored apps or plugins to maps: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. Select any applications from the App/Service list. Rearrange or group together as needed. Browser, databases, external services, connected apps In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are referred to as web external or background external data. To add browser apps, databases, external services, or other connected apps to the map: Select an incoming or outgoing connection widget. From the list of connections, mouse over an app or service, then select the plus icon. Rearrange as needed. Custom nodes To add a custom node to the map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map) > App/Service. From the App/Service list, select Create custom node. Name the node. Add connections: Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. Then select the plus icon on your target node. Select Save. Rearrange as needed. To add or remove custom node connections: Mouse over the custom node and select the pencil icon. Select the left (for incoming) or right (for outgoing) arrow icons. To add a connection, select the plus icon. To remove a connection, select the minus icon. Select Save. Move around the map Move around the map by panning or zooming in and out. If you want to... Do this... Pan the map In pan mode, click and drag. In drag-select mode, hold the Alt key, then click and drag. Zoom in and out In either mode, zoom in and out by scrolling the mouse wheel. View your entire map in traffic light mode Zoom out until node details fade out and are replaced by health status colors. Toggle the traffic light view on and off Select Views, then select Traffic light mode. View all the nodes and their dependencies Select Discover your environment. Drill down into more detail from a node Use standard UI functions. Select, arrange, group nodes Click on a node to select it and view its performance summary. You can also select multiple nodes at once, to group and ungroup them: Select nodes To select one node, click on the node. To select multiple nodes: Click the drag-select icon to switch to drag-select mode. Click and drag the mouse to draw a square around the nodes you want to select. OR Hold the Shift key and click on each node you want to select. Arrange nodes Caution Auto-arrange cannot be undone. Consider saving a copy of your map first. To arrange nodes on the map, select one or more node, then drag to a snap point on the map. To automatically organize all your nodes and connections, select Auto-arrange map. Group and ungroup nodes If you want to... Do this... Group nodes together on the map Select two or more nodes, then select Create group. Name your new group Mouse over the group, then select the pencil icon. Rename an existing group Select the pencil icon. Remove nodes from a group Select the group, then select the minus icon for each item you want to remove. Delete maps To delete a map: Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > (select a map). Select the map name's pencil icon. Select Delete map. Identify issues with external services If your app connects to an external service that New Relic does not monitor (for example, a third-party API), New Relic watches the service for a week in order to baseline its response time. If New Relic can collect a statistically significant number of data points (more than 100), New Relic compares the current response time to this baseline and uses this to set the health status indicator: Green: Response time from the service is less than 1.75 times the baseline. Yellow: Response time from the service is longer than 1.75 times the baseline. Red: Response time from the service is longer than 2.5 times the baseline. Gray: Alerts concluded it does not have enough data to determine the health status. Purple: Alerts cannot yet conclude if it has enough data to determine the health status. Visualize and monitor complex architectures Use service maps to visualize and monitor complex architectures. For a tutorial introducing the latest features, select the service map's question icon. Nodes Nodes are the basic building blocks for your map. You can add a variety of node types including: Node type Description New Relic APM-monitored app Add your app to the map to view their connections to databases, browser apps, out-of-process services, and other instrumented apps. (In the New Relic UI, your out-of-process services are also referred to as web external or background external data.) Browser apps Automatically detected for each app and added via the incoming connections widget. Only displays browser apps linked to an APM app (standalone browser apps are not supported). New Relic mobile monitoring apps Automatically detected and added via the app/service list panel. Plugins, including Databases Automatically detected for each app and added via the connections widget. Databases in service maps require the same agent versions as the new Database page features. External services Service maps automatically detects external services (visible in the connections widget), to track your app's external dependencies and monitor the health of those connections. Custom nodes Add custom nodes via the app/service list panel to include apps and services not automatically instrumented by New Relic (for example, load balancers, implementation planning, and so on). Group nodes A group node contains multiple other nodes. For apps, group nodes include a summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. Node arrangement and grouping Click and drag a node to move it around the map, for a customizable view of your architecture. App nodes can also be grouped together into a single node to better organize related apps and services. Grouped nodes include summarized health status indicator for all nodes in the group. To remove items from a group, mouse over the group and select the pencil pencil icon, then select the minus minus-circle icon to remove the item from the group. Incoming and outgoing connections Service maps automatically detects incoming and outgoing connections based on HTTP calls between entities. Mouse over a node to highlight the node's connections. Widgets at the end of each node display a count of that node's connections, and you can click on those widgets to add related entities to the map: View performance summary Click on an app to view its performance over the last 30 minutes. The chart defaults to Response time, but you can view other metrics by selecting any of the available Apdex, Throughput, or Error rate links. While charts use the last 30 minutes of performance data, the service map as a whole is based on the last five minutes. View the app in APM or browser and view its labels by selecting the overflow ellipsis-v icon. Click the app name again to hide the summary charts, and select the overflow ellipsis-h icon again to hide other details. Map list and app/service list panels Select the Map list panel to: Search for and view your maps, and access other users' shared maps. Create a new map. Select the App/Service List panel to: Add new apps, mobile apps, and plugins to your map. Create custom nodes and add them to the map. Health status and performance metrics You can see health status indicators for most nodes. Except for out-of-process services (external services or background services), entities use the health status indicators used by New Relic Alerts. For out-of-process (external) services, the health status indicator measures the health of the connection to the external service. View all connected apps and services The Discover your environment feature allows you to view all of your apps, services, and dependencies together with a single click. This feature detects all connected applications and services (including externals and databases) to give you a comprehensive view of your overall software architecture environment. To view all connected apps and services: In APM, select Service maps. From your Map list, select Discover your environment to display all of your nodes. Hover over any node to view its dependencies and how it connects to other parts of your service map. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view their details. The Discover your environment feature may not be available if you are using an older New Relic agent version. See Troubleshooting cross application tracing for version information. This feature may also not be available for highly complex service maps with many elements. Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Map list > Discover your environment: Use this option to view all of your nodes and their dependencies in one place. Traffic light mode Traffic light mode lets you view the health status of your entire architecture at a glance. This feature helps you quickly find service and app problems, even within a complex environment with many nodes. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Traffic light mode. When traffic lights mode is On, zooming out far enough on a service map eventually causes the nodes to switch from displaying textual information, to only health status colors. Click on individual nodes to zoom in and view more details. Traffic light mode is on by default. When traffic lights mode is Off, service map nodes retain their textual information and do not switch to health status colors, No matter how far you zoom out. one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps > Views > Traffic light mode: When traffic light mode is enabled, zooming out of your service map displays nodes in health status colors. Midnight mode Midnight mode inverts the screen's colors, going from a white background to a dark background. Midnight mode reduces eye strain, especially in low light environments. To toggle this mode, select the Views tab, then select Midnight mode.",

      "body": "Browser monitoring tips & tricks that every user should know Get more out of browser monitoring, with deeper visibility into your websites and your users. Here are 10 best practices to help you find problems faster and deliver a better experience to your customers with real user monitoring. 1. Use browser SPA agent Use the browser SPA agent for deeper visibility Modern websites are complex, with dynamic content and sophisticated logic. See deeper into your user interactions, enable the single-page application (SPA) agent for browser and gain visibility into your user actions and the underlying webpage events behind them. This framework-agnostic agent is not only for single-page application frameworks like React, Angular, Ember, or Backbone, but also for custom frameworks and any other pages with dynamic content. Advanced timing analytics provide more granularity into Navigation Timing Specification API sub-timings beyond page rendering or DOM processing, with detailed performance data filtering useful for understanding all page lifecycles. How to do it From the browser app list, select an app, then select Settings > Application Settings. Select Pro + SPA. Click Save application settings Change your browser monitoring settings to switch to SPA. 2. Use APM auto-instrumentation Use APM automatic instrumentation over copy/paste If you’re also a APM customer, we recommend enabling automatic instrumentation where possible, as this will automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript agent into your frontend for you. Not only will the browser agent remain automatically up to date with this approach, using these products together helps unify frontend to backend visibility. For example, you’d be able to link frontend AJAX calls to their corresponding backend transaction, and to align your frontend and backend data together in an Insights dashboard. Tip Depending on your backend framework or CDN strategy, a copy/paste approach may be the better strategy. Just remember that it’ll require periodic updating. How to do it Select Settings > Application Settings. Select Enable via New Relic APM. Select Pro + SPA agent. Click Save application settings. one.newrelic.com > Browser > Settings > Application Settings 3. Customize Apdex Customize your Apdex threshold New Relic uses Apdex, an industry-standard metric, to measure users’ satisfaction with the response time of your applications. Apdex converts many measurements into one number on a uniform scale of 0 to 1 (0 = no users satisfied, 1 = all users satisfied). Apdex T is the central value for Apdex—it is the response time below which a transaction is considered “Satisfactory.” You can define Apdex T values for each application, with separate values for app server and end-user browser performance. (Note that many modern websites are bottlenecked primarily in the frontend browser, accounting for 90% or more of pageload times.) While a suggested T-value threshold is 5 seconds, we encourage you to customize your Apdex T value to fit the needs of your users and application. For example, an ecommerce site may want to have a lower T value to reduce bounce rates from potential buyers frustrated by a slow experience, compared to an internal employee application. However, the goal is to continually lower T-values over time to improve your digital customer experience. How to do it From the browser app list, select an app, then select Settings > Application settings. Set the Apdex T value (in seconds) for this application. Click Save application settings. one.newrelic.com > Browser > Settings > Application 4. Create alerts Create and evaluate alert policies What happens if your Apdex score exceeds your threshold? You want to be alerted whenever this happens, so that you can investigate what is causing the issue before you lose any customers. New Relic provides unified alerting across all our products, including browser monitoring, so that you’ll always be in the know. We recommend setting up alerts to monitor your Apdex score, along with these sample alerts to get you started: Apdex score: Alert if score is below 0.8 for 5 minutes. (If the Apdex score is below 0.8, that means 20% or more of your users are not “satisfied” with their experience on your website.) Page load time: Alert if median page load time is above 10 seconds for 5 minutes. (If the median page load time begins to spike, that suggest that something may be wrong with your web page causing it to significantly slow down. This complements alerting on your Apdex score.) JS errors: Alert if error rate is above 5% for 5 minutes. (If your frontend error rate starts spiking, particularly after a deployment, you may have introduced bad JavaScript into your frontend that should be fixed.) How to do it From Alerts & AI, select Go to Alerts, and click on Policies on the left column. Select (+) New alert policy to create a new alert policy, and give it a meaningful name. Click on Create a condition to create your first condition, then select Browser for your product and the Metric for the condition (which should be the default). Then click Next, select entities. Click the checkbox for the applications you want to alert on, and click Next, define thresholds. Pick the metrics of interest and their thresholds that determine when to trigger an alert. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Policies > New alert policy 5. Use baseline alerts Alert on anomalous behaviors and events While some metrics can be easily tracked against specific thresholds, other types of data can be more cyclical or have variable ranges for what’s considered healthy. Traffic throughput is a good example of this; it can have significantly cycles, but large traffic drops or spikes may be important indicators of a breakage preventing user traffic or a DDoS attack spiking traffic. Baseline alerts can be helpful for creating an expected \"band\" of normal activity to create more signal to noise in your alerting. How to do it From Alerts & AI, select Go to Alerts, and click on Policies on the left column. Select (+) New alert policy to create a new alert policy, and give it a meaningful name. Click on Create a condition to create your first condition, select Browser for your product and the Metric Baseline for the condition (which should be the default). Then click Next, select entities. Click the checkbox for the applications you want to alert on, and click Next, define thresholds. Pick the Page view throughput and use the slider to define the normal range you want to trigger the alert. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Policies > New alert policy 6. Add alerts to workflows Integrate your alerts into your workflows With the different alerting policies that you’re setting up, you’ll want to make sure to take advantage of the different alert notification channels available so that they’re integrated into team workflows. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can route alerts through Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks, email, and more. You also have the opportunity to align alert notifications with your response processes, such as integrating with ChatOps or linking runbooks to your alerts. Be sure to evaluate alert policies on a regular basis to ensure that they are always valid. How to do it From Alerts & AI, click on Notification channels. Set up different notification channels, which can then be used within different alerting policies. 7. Create dashboards Create your own dashboards using New Relic Insights Browser automatically provides a curated experience to quickly triage issues, but you can also create bespoke dashboards with your frontend data with the query builder. Build unique real-time overviews of what’s going on in your frontend, and see how it fits with the rest of your technology stack. For example, you can: Create a browser-specific breakdown of percentiles, durations, and page views: SELECT average(duration),percentile(duration,50,75,95) as 'Percentile', count(*) as 'Pageviews' FROM PageView WHERE userAgentName='Chrome' SINCE 1 week ago Copy Break down route change performance into percentiles: SELECT count(*) as 'Route Change', average(duration) as 'Avg PageLoad',percentile(duration,50,75) as '%' ,average(jsDuration) as 'JS Duration' FROM BrowserInteraction FACET targetUrl where category = 'Route change' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Compare frontend performance to backend performance in APM: SELECT average(duration) as 'Avg Frontend Duration', average(backendDuration) FROM PageView SINCE 2 minutes ago UNTIL 10 seconds ago TIMESERIES Copy These individual widgets can be added together to create a team dashboard that’s shared across different engineering teams and the company. You can bring together web and mobile application data, backend data, infrastructure data, synthetic monitoring data, and more, all on a single custom dashboard across New Relic One. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards How to do it Go to one.newrelic.com, then click Query your data to access the query builder. In the NRQL tab of the query builder, paste the query into the NRQL> query bar and click Run. Type in a widget title, and add to either an existing or a new dashboard. Go to Dashboards to see your new dashboard. For more information, see our docs on data querying and dashboards. 8. Group your data Group your data into meaningful categories Different websites have different URL architectures, which can vary depending on content structure, technology framework, or SEO strategy. For example: website.com/product/widget-name website.com/gallery?product=109832 website.com/gallery/housewares/lamps/widget-name website.com/product#widget-name URL structure possibilities are endless, so browser includes an automatic grouping algorithm to set categories for that data into different URL groups. We recommend using URL grouping allowed lists to customize how your data is grouped together, which makes the corresponding performance information more useful and aligned to your website architecture. If the data generated by this default grouping is too high level, creating a URL grouping will disaggregate the data and give you greater granularity to make it more useful. For example, you could group by: Different page types: product pages vs. search pages Different forms, APIs, or user groupings Mobile vs. non-mobile Authenticated vs. non-authenticated Different content delivery networks (CDNs) How to do it In the browser monitoring UI, select Settings > Segment allow lists. In the Allow listed segments section, click on the + icon. Type in the URL segments you want to appear in groupings on the page views and AJAX pages. one.newrelic.com > Browser > Settings > Segment allow lists. 9. Get the right data Make sure you get data only from the right sources Browser data is generated from wherever your JavaScript agent is instrumented, though copies of your agent might become duplicated, such as through development, staging, or other environments, resulting in additional data being included from these sources that you would not want mixed with your production data. You can use domain conditions to allow or deny data from the different website domains you want monitored. How to do it In the browser monitoring UI, select Settings > Domain conditions. If there are no domain conditions in place, select Enable domain conditions. If conditions exist, select Next, Choose your setting. Select Deny only or Allow only to identify the data you want collected from the domains you want monitored. Then select Next, Create conditions. Enter the domain string conditions that you want to deny or allow data collection (maximum 10 conditions). Review and confirm your domain condition settings. one.newrelic.com > Browser > Settings > Domain conditions. 10. Break down performance data Break down performance across your users, business, and more By leveraging New Relic APIs, you can add vital context to your performance data as it relates to your technology, users, and your business. All our monitoring tools send their data to New Relic One, which enables plenty of customization and extensibility in your dashboarding. Just be sure to standardize naming for custom events and attributes across different data sources (such as between browser and mobile) for omnichannel engagement. Here are some examples of what you can measure: Build id: Pass in a build number to A/B test differences between versions User id: Manage your VIP customers and track their experience Cart value: Understand how much revenue is at risk when errors occur during checkout Content type: Track the type of content your users are viewing Video playback: See how users are consuming your media content The possibilities are endless. And as you can see, this type of reporting creates context around how your application performance impacts the rest of the business. How to do it Use our APIs to pass custom data about people, things, money, and more into New Relic One. Visit one.newrelic.com, and query on the custom data that is now available. For more information, see our docs on data querying and dashboards. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > (selected dashboard). Want more user tips? View training videos at New Relic University.

For information on how to set up browser monitoring for your Java app, see Browser monitoring and the Java agent. Ensure you are using the Apache Jasper compiler. The New Relic Java agent only auto-instruments pages compiled with the Apache Jasper compiler. The following application servers use the Jasper compiler by default: Tomcat Jetty Glassfish JBoss 4 Place meta tags immediately after the initial head tag. Recommendation: Place all <meta> tags immediately after the initial <head> tag. Some meta tags have requirements on how close they need to be to the beginning of an HTML document. The character encoding must be declared within the first 512 bytes of the HTML document. If the New Relic header is placed before the character encoding, it is possible for the character encoding to then be outside that 512 byte limit. Placing the character encoding meta tag immediately after the <head> tag will ensure that the New Relic header is positioned after the character encoding. <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta charset=\"utf-8\"> <%= com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() %> . . . </head> Copy The X-UA-Compatible meta tag should be within the meta tags immediately after the <head> tag. This tag allows page authors to set the document mode used for rending the page in Internet Explorer. This tag should be placed before any script tags. If the New Relic header is positioned before the X-UA-Compatible meta tag, the page might display incorrectly in Internet Explorer. <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=9\"> <%= com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() %> . . . </head> Copy Avoid if ... else statements in the head section. The auto instrumentation script does not recognize if ... else statements within a JSP page. If you have an if ... else block before your first non-meta, non-title tag, the New Relic header might be placed in the incorrect position in the page. For example, this code could potentially cause the auto instrumentation script to be inserted before the meta tags: if (expression) { <nonmeta tag> } <meta tag> <meta tag> Copy Avoid expressions with the less than sign in the head section. The New Relic Java agent looks for the open angle bracket < to mark the beginning of an HTML tag. This means if you have an expression using a less than sign, then you will either need to change your expression to use a greater than sign or use manual instrumentation. For example: <head> <% for (i = 0; i < variable; i++) . . . %> Copy",

      "body": "Application Monitoring Tips You Need To Know It's one thing to know how to use APM, but it's another thing to know how to use New Relic's application performance monitoring software well. Here are some best practices designed to help you become an APM master—and a key asset to your team! Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. 1. Standardize application names Most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as \"My Application\" or \"PHP Application,\" if you don't specify one in your New Relic configuration file. You don't want to end up with 20 identically named applications, be sure to select a descriptive identifier for your apps as soon you deploy them. To keep things consistent and easy to navigate, New Relic recommends standardizing your application naming (for example, all apps in Staging append [ Staging] or the like at the end of their names). Ideally, you want your new Java applications to be named automatically to reduce the chances of typographical errors and misnaming. How to do it For Java applications, automatic application naming can come from the following sources: Request attribute Servlet init parameter Filter init parameter Web app context parameter Web app context name (display name) Web app context path Choose the method that fits best your needs and follow these steps. For non-Java applications, there are no automatic naming methods, so refer to the documentation for your APM agent. 2. Add tags to your applications When several different applications use the same account, and each application spans multiple environments (for example, development, test, pre-production, production), it can be hard to find a specific application in your overview dashboard. That's why we recommend adding tags to your apps so that you can segment them into logical groups. The two most common tags that mature APM customers use are application name and environment. So, for example, if you wanted to view the billing application in Test, you could simply filter by \"billing app\" (name tag) and \"test\" (environment tag). Caution In the APM agent configuration settings files, use the labels field to add tags to your data. For example, see this description of the Python labels setting. APM is designed so that apps can roll up into an unlimited number of meaningful tag categories. How to do it Learn about tags. Learn how to add tags.. Learn how to query tags. 3. Create and evaluate alert policies When key performance indicators spike or drop, individuals and teams in your organization need to be notified. Alerting in New Relic provides a set of tools including dynamic baselines that allow you to detect problems before they impact your end users. Alert policies can be set up in two primary ways: Static threshold alerts are great when you already know the nature of an application and its normal behaviors aren't likely to change anytime soon. Apdex score, response time, error rate, throughput are some of the static thresholds you can create alert policies on. Dynamic baseline alerts make it easy to determine and set dynamic alert thresholds for applications with varying seasonal patterns and growth trends (which make it difficult to set thresholds that define normal behavior). These alerts use baselines modeled from your application’s historical metric data. Each alert policy can contain as many conditions as you need, and each alert condition includes three components: Type of condition (metric, external service, and so on) Entities that the policy targets (for example, APM apps, browser monitoring apps, or hosts) Thresholds that escalate into alerting situations with increasing severity Once you have your alerting set up, you then want to make sure you're taking advantage of all viable notification channels. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can manage alerts by creating specific user groups and by leveraging New Relic's integrated alert channels, including Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks, and email. Be sure to evaluate alert policies on a regular basis to ensure that they are always valid. How to do it See the detailed documentation: To set up dynamic baseline alerts and choose an application, follow standard procedures. You will see a preview of the metric with the predicted baseline You can select a metric for that application and see the corresponding baseline. Then, using the threshold sliders, you can set how closely you want your threshold to follow the baseline prediction. To set up static threshold alerts for your Apdex settings, follow standard procedures. To set up your alert notification channels, follow standard procedures. 4. Identify and set up key transactions Depending on the nature of your application, some transactions may be more important to you than others. New Relic's key transactions feature is designed to help you closely monitor what you consider to be your app's most business-critical transactions, whether that's end-user or app response time, call counts, error rates, or something else. You can also set alert threshold levels for notifications when your key transactions are performing poorly. How to do it In the menu bar, select More > Key transactions, and then select Add more. Then select the app and web transaction or, from the selected transaction, select Track as key transaction. Type a name for the key transaction, and select Track key transaction. Optional: If the agent for the selected app supports custom alerting, use the default values that New Relic automatically fills, or select Edit key alert transaction policy to set the Apdex and alert threshold values. To view the key transactions dashboard details, select View new key transaction. 5. Track deployment history When development teams are pushing new code out as frequently as possible, it can be hard to measure the impact that each deployment is having on performance. One way to stay in tune with how these changes are affecting your application is with deployment reports. These reports list recent deployments and their impact on end-users and app servers' Apdex scores, along with response times, throughput, and errors. You can also view and drill down into the details to catch errors related to recent deployments, or file a ticket and share details with your team. How to do it From the New Relic menu bar, select APM > (selected app) > Events > Deployments. To view performance after a deployment, go to the selected app's Overview dashboard in the Recent events section. A blue vertical bar on a chart indicates a deployment. To view summary information about the deployment, point to the blue bar. 6. Review APM reports From SLA, deployment, and capacity to scalability, host usage reports, and more, New Relic APM offers a variety of downloadable reporting tools surfacing historical trends—all great ways to report to senior executive teams or customers. Take a look at the full list of reports and use them to your advantage. How to do it From the New Relic APM menu bar, select Applications > (selected app) > Reports. Select the report you'd like to see. If you want to save or export a report to share, select Download this report as .csv, which will create a report with comma-separated values. 7. Review your environment with service maps Use New Relic service maps, a feature included in APM, to understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and talk to each other. Service maps are visual, customizable representations of your application architecture. Maps automatically show you your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. How to do it Go to one.newrelic.com > More > service maps. To get started, read the instructions in Introduction to service maps. 8. Keep current With New Relic’s SaaS platform, getting new features is as easy as updating your agent. Most likely your organization already has a set of scripts for deploying application upgrades into your environment. In a similar fashion, you can also automate your New Relic agent deployment to ensure that your systems are up to date. Both Puppet and Chef scripts are great examples of deployment frameworks that make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. How to do it Regularly review which version of the agent you're using so that you know when an update is needed. If the latest agent release contains a needed fix or added functionality, download it. To deploy the agent automatically (preferred as a method to avoid errors): Use existing deployment scripts, provided they can be adapted to handle the deployment. OR Create and maintain a script that specifically deploys and configures the New Relic agent. Ideally, the script would pull the agent files from a repository where the files are versioned (for rollback purposes). Once the script has been created, shut down the application (unless script handles this). Run the deployment script. Start the application (unless script handles this). If problems arise, run the script to roll back to the previous version. To deploy the agent manually: Back up the current agent directory. Deploy the updated agent into the existing agent directory. Modify configuration files by comparing new files with existing files. In particular, make sure things like license key and custom extensions are copied over to the new configuration. Restart the application. If problems arise, restore the old agent using the backup and restart. 9. Manage user access Important This is available only for accounts on our original product-based pricing plan. Enable role-based access control (RBAC) and single sign-on (SSO) New Relic allows authorized individuals to access the broadest possible amount of data, regardless of their assigned role. As an Owner or Administrator of your New Relic account, you can control the permissions of individual users or entire roles with RBAC. To find out what is possible and how to make changes, see Users and roles. Security is no doubt of utmost concern to your organization. To simplify password management for your employees and strengthen security, you may already be using SSO with your other systems. You should do the same with New Relic. Using New Relic's SSO integration feature, account administrators will be able to enforce strong passwords and restrict login via a corporate authentication mechanism. This way, New Relic users who have already authenticated using a corporate SSO system will be able to bypass the New Relic login prompt. How to do it Log in to New Relic as an admin and go to the SSO configuration page. From the New Relic title bar, select (your account name) > Account Settings > Integrations > Single Sign On. From the SAML Single Sign On page, review your New Relic SAML Service Provider details. To upload your SAML Identity Provider certificate, select Choose File, and then follow standard procedures to select and save the file. Copy and paste in (or type) the Remove login URL that your users will use for Single Sign-On. If your organization’s SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, copy and paste in (or type) the Logout landing URL; otherwise leave blank. Save, test, and enable.",

      "body": "New Relic provides integrations for many popular services and frameworks. If you have New Relic and want to report data from a service we don't have an integration for, there are several ways New Relic lets you create your own integration: With New Relic infrastructure monitoring, you can use our lightweight Flex tool (recommended, documented below) or, to build a complete on-host integration, see our Integrations SDK. Telemetry (metrics, traces) monitoring solutions: Use our Telemetry SDKs. Build a custom New Relic One application that uses your own JavaScript UI functionality. What is Flex? New Relic Flex is an application-agnostic, all-in-one tool that allows you to collect metric data from a wide variety of services. It comes bundled with our infrastructure agent. You can instrument any app that exposes metrics over a standard protocol (HTTP, file, shell) in a standard format (for example, JSON or plain text): you create a YAML config file, start the Infrastructure agent, and your data is reported to New Relic. Flex can send event and metric data to New Relic from a wide range of sources. Using a simple YAML config file, you can run HTTP/HTTPS requests, run shell commands, and parse file content. You can also use standard regex expressions to customize and control the data gathered from those inputs. See an example config. After collecting and cleaning up the data, you can then query Flex data in New Relic, create custom charts for it, and use that data in your dashboards. Requirements Flex comes bundled with our infrastructure agent. To use Flex, you need: Infrastructure agent version 1.10.7 or higher (update | check version) running on Linux, Windows, or Kubernetes. How does Flex work? Flex uses our infrastructure agent to execute commands that generate the data you want to report. Here's a brief overview of how Flex works to report data: You define the data you want to report in a YAML configuration file, located in the infrastructure agent package. See an example configuration: Example config The following is an example of a Flex configuration for monitoring the uptime of a Linux server. This configuration is placed in a file named flex-uptime.yml. This would be placed in the infrastructure agent's integration configuration section, located at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/flex-uptime.yml. integrations: - name: nri-flex config: name: linuxUptimeIntegration apis: - name: Uptime commands: - run: 'cat /proc/uptime' split: horizontal split_by: \\s+ set_header: [uptimeSeconds,idletimeSeconds] Copy Some notes on what this configuration does: run defines the command to execute. The name indicated by name: Uptime is appended with Sample to generate an event called UptimeSample. The name should not start with the ESX or PCF prefix. The split_by: \\s+ splits the fields based on the space character. The command generates attributes attached to the UptimeSample event. The attributes are named uptimeSeconds and idletimeSeconds. The infrastructure agent runs Flex at a frequency based on its own configuration (default: every 30 seconds) and sends the data to New Relic. You can then query your data, create custom charts with it, and add it to dashboards. Learn more The Flex integration comes bundled with the infrastructure agent. Learn more about requirements.

      "body": "With New Relic APM's PHP agent, you can monitor applications that reside in the Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment. Adding New Relic to your GAE flex app gives you insight into the health and performance of your app and extends GAE with metrics you can view in APM, browser monitoring, and dashboards. This document explains how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by configuring a custom runtime, and gives an example of deploying a PHP app with Docker. Important The New Relic PHP agent can run in a GAE flexible environment using a custom runtime. Due to limitations of other environments, do not use the GAE standard environment or Google App Engine's \"native mode\" installation. Build a custom runtime using Docker See Google's documentation for building custom runtimes. This example describes how to add New Relic to your GAE flex app by installing the New Relic PHP agent, building a custom runtime, and deploying a single PHP application via Debian. For best results with the GAE flex environment, always use Debian. For more information about deploying and configuring your PHP app in the GAE flexible environment, see: Google App Engine's documentation for PHP Google App Engine's tutorials to deploy a PHP app 1. Set up the GAE project and install dependencies Follow standard procedures to install the New Relic PHP agent for your specific app server, and obtain your license key. Follow Google App Engine procedures for PHP to create a new Cloud Platform project, create an App Engine application, and complete other prerequisites for the Google Cloud SDK. The Google Cloud SDK provides the gcloud command line tool to manage and deploy GAE apps. 2. Extend the GAE image for PHP In this example, the Dockerfile extends the generic PHP image with application files for a single application in Debian. You can add your New Relic license key directly to your Dockerfile, or use an environment variable in your docker run command. FROM gcr.io/google-appengine/php:latest ENV DOCUMENT_ROOT /app RUN DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get update; DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get -y install wget sudo RUN wget -O - https://download.newrelic.com/548C16BF.gpg | sudo apt-key add - RUN echo 'deb http://apt.newrelic.com/debian/ newrelic non-free' | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/newrelic.list RUN DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get -y install newrelic-php5 RUN NR_INSTALL_KEY=\"new-relic-license-key\" NR_INSTALL_SILENT=true newrelic-install install Copy 3. Configure your app.yaml The app.yaml configuration file is required for a GAE flexible environment app with a custom runtime. At a minimum, make sure it contains: env: flex runtime: custom runtime_config: document_root: . Copy 4. Build a Docker image The Dockerfile defines the Docker image to be built and is required for a GAE flexible environment app. When building the Docker image, use the PHP image from Google App Engine. Standard Docker images from other providers may cause problems with GAE. To build the Docker image, run the following command. Be sure to include the period at the end of the code, to indicate the current directory contains the build files. docker build --rm -t Docker-image-name . Copy 5. Deploy Docker image to initialized GAE flexible environment To deploy your Docker image to your initialized GAE flexible environment, run the following command: gcloud app deploy --project php-app-name Copy Wait until the deployment completes. To view your GAE flex app data in New Relic, go to the New Relic APM Overview page. Optional: Disable health checks Google App Engine sends periodic health check requests to confirm that an instance has been successfully deployed, and to check that a running instance maintains a healthy status. A health check is an HTTP request to the URL /_ah/health. If you create a custom runtime, your app must be able to handle a large number of health check requests. Otherwise, your app data may not display correctly in New Relic APM. If you notice performance issues, disable GAE health checks. In your app.yaml, add: health_check: enable_health_check: False Copy Get New Relic agent troubleshooting logs from GAE Use these resources to troubleshoot your GAE flex environment app: To connect to the GAE instance and start a shell in the Docker container running your code, see Debugging an instance. To redirect New Relic PHP agent logs to the Stackdriver in the Cloud Platform Console, change the newrelic.yml file to: log_file_name: STDOUT Copy To view the logs, use the Cloud Platform Console's Log Viewer.

      "body": "Application Monitoring Tips You Need To Know It's one thing to know how to use APM, but it's another thing to know how to use New Relic's application performance monitoring software well. Here are some best practices designed to help you become an APM master—and a key asset to your team! Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. 1. Standardize application names Most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as \"My Application\" or \"PHP Application,\" if you don't specify one in your New Relic configuration file. You don't want to end up with 20 identically named applications, be sure to select a descriptive identifier for your apps as soon you deploy them. To keep things consistent and easy to navigate, New Relic recommends standardizing your application naming (for example, all apps in Staging append [ Staging] or the like at the end of their names). Ideally, you want your new Java applications to be named automatically to reduce the chances of typographical errors and misnaming. How to do it For Java applications, automatic application naming can come from the following sources: Request attribute Servlet init parameter Filter init parameter Web app context parameter Web app context name (display name) Web app context path Choose the method that fits best your needs and follow these steps. For non-Java applications, there are no automatic naming methods, so refer to the documentation for your APM agent. 2. Add tags to your applications When several different applications use the same account, and each application spans multiple environments (for example, development, test, pre-production, production), it can be hard to find a specific application in your overview dashboard. That's why we recommend adding tags to your apps so that you can segment them into logical groups. The two most common tags that mature APM customers use are application name and environment. So, for example, if you wanted to view the billing application in Test, you could simply filter by \"billing app\" (name tag) and \"test\" (environment tag). Caution In the APM agent configuration settings files, use the labels field to add tags to your data. For example, see this description of the Python labels setting. APM is designed so that apps can roll up into an unlimited number of meaningful tag categories. How to do it Learn about tags. Learn how to add tags.. Learn how to query tags. 3. Create and evaluate alert policies When key performance indicators spike or drop, individuals and teams in your organization need to be notified. Alerting in New Relic provides a set of tools including dynamic baselines that allow you to detect problems before they impact your end users. Alert policies can be set up in two primary ways: Static threshold alerts are great when you already know the nature of an application and its normal behaviors aren't likely to change anytime soon. Apdex score, response time, error rate, throughput are some of the static thresholds you can create alert policies on. Dynamic baseline alerts make it easy to determine and set dynamic alert thresholds for applications with varying seasonal patterns and growth trends (which make it difficult to set thresholds that define normal behavior). These alerts use baselines modeled from your application’s historical metric data. Each alert policy can contain as many conditions as you need, and each alert condition includes three components: Type of condition (metric, external service, and so on) Entities that the policy targets (for example, APM apps, browser monitoring apps, or hosts) Thresholds that escalate into alerting situations with increasing severity Once you have your alerting set up, you then want to make sure you're taking advantage of all viable notification channels. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can manage alerts by creating specific user groups and by leveraging New Relic's integrated alert channels, including Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks, and email. Be sure to evaluate alert policies on a regular basis to ensure that they are always valid. How to do it See the detailed documentation: To set up dynamic baseline alerts and choose an application, follow standard procedures. You will see a preview of the metric with the predicted baseline You can select a metric for that application and see the corresponding baseline. Then, using the threshold sliders, you can set how closely you want your threshold to follow the baseline prediction. To set up static threshold alerts for your Apdex settings, follow standard procedures. To set up your alert notification channels, follow standard procedures. 4. Identify and set up key transactions Depending on the nature of your application, some transactions may be more important to you than others. New Relic's key transactions feature is designed to help you closely monitor what you consider to be your app's most business-critical transactions, whether that's end-user or app response time, call counts, error rates, or something else. You can also set alert threshold levels for notifications when your key transactions are performing poorly. How to do it In the menu bar, select More > Key transactions, and then select Add more. Then select the app and web transaction or, from the selected transaction, select Track as key transaction. Type a name for the key transaction, and select Track key transaction. Optional: If the agent for the selected app supports custom alerting, use the default values that New Relic automatically fills, or select Edit key alert transaction policy to set the Apdex and alert threshold values. To view the key transactions dashboard details, select View new key transaction. 5. Track deployment history When development teams are pushing new code out as frequently as possible, it can be hard to measure the impact that each deployment is having on performance. One way to stay in tune with how these changes are affecting your application is with deployment reports. These reports list recent deployments and their impact on end-users and app servers' Apdex scores, along with response times, throughput, and errors. You can also view and drill down into the details to catch errors related to recent deployments, or file a ticket and share details with your team. How to do it From the New Relic menu bar, select APM > (selected app) > Events > Deployments. To view performance after a deployment, go to the selected app's Overview dashboard in the Recent events section. A blue vertical bar on a chart indicates a deployment. To view summary information about the deployment, point to the blue bar. 6. Review APM reports From SLA, deployment, and capacity to scalability, host usage reports, and more, New Relic APM offers a variety of downloadable reporting tools surfacing historical trends—all great ways to report to senior executive teams or customers. Take a look at the full list of reports and use them to your advantage. How to do it From the New Relic APM menu bar, select Applications > (selected app) > Reports. Select the report you'd like to see. If you want to save or export a report to share, select Download this report as .csv, which will create a report with comma-separated values. 7. Review your environment with service maps Use New Relic service maps, a feature included in APM, to understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and talk to each other. Service maps are visual, customizable representations of your application architecture. Maps automatically show you your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. How to do it Go to one.newrelic.com > More > service maps. To get started, read the instructions in Introduction to service maps. 8. Keep current With New Relic’s SaaS platform, getting new features is as easy as updating your agent. Most likely your organization already has a set of scripts for deploying application upgrades into your environment. In a similar fashion, you can also automate your New Relic agent deployment to ensure that your systems are up to date. Both Puppet and Chef scripts are great examples of deployment frameworks that make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. How to do it Regularly review which version of the agent you're using so that you know when an update is needed. If the latest agent release contains a needed fix or added functionality, download it. To deploy the agent automatically (preferred as a method to avoid errors): Use existing deployment scripts, provided they can be adapted to handle the deployment. OR Create and maintain a script that specifically deploys and configures the New Relic agent. Ideally, the script would pull the agent files from a repository where the files are versioned (for rollback purposes). Once the script has been created, shut down the application (unless script handles this). Run the deployment script. Start the application (unless script handles this). If problems arise, run the script to roll back to the previous version. To deploy the agent manually: Back up the current agent directory. Deploy the updated agent into the existing agent directory. Modify configuration files by comparing new files with existing files. In particular, make sure things like license key and custom extensions are copied over to the new configuration. Restart the application. If problems arise, restore the old agent using the backup and restart. 9. Manage user access Important This is available only for accounts on our original product-based pricing plan. Enable role-based access control (RBAC) and single sign-on (SSO) New Relic allows authorized individuals to access the broadest possible amount of data, regardless of their assigned role. As an Owner or Administrator of your New Relic account, you can control the permissions of individual users or entire roles with RBAC. To find out what is possible and how to make changes, see Users and roles. Security is no doubt of utmost concern to your organization. To simplify password management for your employees and strengthen security, you may already be using SSO with your other systems. You should do the same with New Relic. Using New Relic's SSO integration feature, account administrators will be able to enforce strong passwords and restrict login via a corporate authentication mechanism. This way, New Relic users who have already authenticated using a corporate SSO system will be able to bypass the New Relic login prompt. How to do it Log in to New Relic as an admin and go to the SSO configuration page. From the New Relic title bar, select (your account name) > Account Settings > Integrations > Single Sign On. From the SAML Single Sign On page, review your New Relic SAML Service Provider details. To upload your SAML Identity Provider certificate, select Choose File, and then follow standard procedures to select and save the file. Copy and paste in (or type) the Remove login URL that your users will use for Single Sign-On. If your organization’s SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, copy and paste in (or type) the Logout landing URL; otherwise leave blank. Save, test, and enable.",

      "body": "By eliminating crashes and increasing speed across the stack, you can build better performance into every mobile app release. Here are some best practices to take full advantage of mobile monitoring with New Relic. 1. Start collecting data Start collecting data in production. You'll see immediate value by adding our mobile monitoring SDK to your app for its next release to the app store. We recommend installing the iOS or Android agent to your production release even if you're simply testing New Relic's capabilities. This will ensure you'll get an adequate amount of data to really understand all of our mobile monitoring capabilities and your end users' experience. How to do it Add your mobile app to New Relic First, add a new app in New Relic's user interface (full steps): Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. From the list of monitored apps, select Add more. Select the relevant platform. Type a name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Use one app and the associated app token for the development releases of your iOS app, another app and its associated app token for the production releases of that iOS app, and another pair of app tokens for development and production releases of your Android app. You'll be able to compare data from across the four app tokens using our query builder. Install and configure our mobile SDK Next, install and configure the mobile agent: Download the latest version of New Relic's SDK for iOS or Android, and add it to your mobile app. (Full steps for iOS and Android) Configure your installation as needed. For example: Enable the feature flag to capture MobileRequest events to use our full network analysis capabilities for iOS or Android. Automate dSYM uploads for your production builds. To avoid surprises, follow the standard pattern of where you start our mobile agent. In addition, start our agent before you initiate any other SDKs. For more information, see our documentation for Android installation and configuration and for iOS installation and configuration. Deploy a new release of your application. 2. Explore your data Immediately be able to explore your data. As soon as New Relic starts reporting data, take the time to explore the wealth of information about your mobile apps. To get started, go to one.newrelic.com and select Mobile. How to do it Analyze, resolve, and prevent crashes Find the cause of crashes so you can fix them. Then, uncover trends behind crashes so you can prevent them: From the summary UI page for a monitored mobile app, click Crash analysis. Analyze crash data so you can see and fix the most impactful crashes. Follow the breadcrumbs in the crash event trail to fix crashes and resolve critical errors more easily: From your mobile app's Crash analysis page in the UI, select a Crash type. From the crash type's Summary page, select the Crash trail tab. For more information, see our blog post about crash analysis. Monitor your key workflows Create custom breadcrumbs to monitor key workflows (such as your app's login or checkout process), track user clicks, optimize timing, and identify crash locations for faster MTTR. Get actionable session data Borrow from our example queries to: See how much of your user base has upgraded to your latest app version. Track adoption over time. Get a count of new installs as compared to upgrades from an earlier version. See the distribution of usage across geographical locations, carriers, ASN owners (wi-fi providers), devices, connection types, and more. 3. Take preventive steps Use alert notifications to help uncover the causes behind crashes and errors. Once you are running our mobile monitoring capabilities in production and have explored some of the key features, you can use New Relic to uncover critical issues with your mobile application. In particular, focus on crashes and errors. Use metric-based alerts as a starting point to gain high-level visibility into problems. Then, as new services or functionalities are added, use New Relic’s more targeted, event-based (NRQL) alerts to make sure that the most critical issues are handled swiftly. Use these alerts to determine whether a crash is impacting a large number of users. If it is, the relevant people (for example, both the mobile app team’s on-call member and the owner of the related back-end service) will be alerted. Make sure that your team knows how to respond to changes in crash rate (crashes per sessions) and the percentage of users impacted by crashes of your mobile app. How to do it Metric-based alerts Use our metric-based alerts and mobile monitoring UI: Ensure that key members of your mobile team have opted in to receive emails for new crashes. These emails will take you to the crash type in the UI page for your mobile app. Create an alert for your crash rate threshold that key members of your team can view in Slack or any other Alerts notification channel you choose. Your alert notification will include a link to our UI, where you can examine a chart with the exceeded threshold. From there, a link will take you to the relevant mobile monitoring page, where you can get additional details. Event-based alerts Combine the metric-based workflow with event-based alerts and dashboards specific to your mobile app and system. Create your NRQL alert that focuses on crashes of your most recently released production version. Create an additional NRQL alert that focuses on the percentage of users impacted by crashes in your latest app version (to check the overall impact on your user base). 4. Dig deeper into crashes Take your crash reporting to the next level. Now it’s time to tackle some of those harder-to-reproduce crashes by: Applying additional instrumentation to your application. Leveraging crash event trails, NRQL queries, and dashboards to visualize your data. How to do it Crash analysis Crashes are an inevitable part of running mobile applications at scale. We provide tools to help you understand your highest-impact crashes. Use the Crash analysis UI to see which crashes are occurring most often, the percentage of crash-free users, which files and methods are associated with perhaps 80 percent of your crashes, which crashes a particular user just experienced, and more. Go after high-impact crashes with crash analysis: Add custom attributes to categorize the highest-value customers, and then use them to segment crashes according to your most valuable audiences. Add breadcrumbs and custom events to produce a detailed trail of events leading up to every crash occurrence (over the last 90 days). Then, view this crash event trail in our mobile monitoring UI. Use our mobile monitoring's Versions trends page to make sure you’re improving the crash rate over subsequent releases and avoiding regressions. Breadcrumbs Use breadcrumbs and custom attributes to better reproduce and debug crashes. For example, use our recordBreadrumb API for Android or iOS to track mid-session changes in state that can help debug crashes, such as: Change of connection type Change of orientation CPU and memory state at key points in the app code Custom attributes Add custom attributes to existing events, so you can ask even more precise questions of your mobile app. Add dimensions such as: User ID: Use to react to specific user concerns and to better understand which customers and segments are most impacted. Store ID: Use to address problems with out-of-date devices, bad wi-fi, and so on. User segments: Use to better understand which customers and segments are most impacted; for example, logged in vs. non-logged in. Money in the cart at session end Origin or attribution of entry into the app Standardize custom attribute names across your mobile apps, and align with your website (if you're using our browser monitoring), so that you can compare and contrast performance across end-user channels. The mobile agents track the last interaction of crashed and non-crashed sessions to provide visibility into what the user viewed before exiting your app (either intentionally or due to a crash). 5. Focus on KPIs Bring your key performance indicators to life. Create custom interactions and events to hone in on the most important signals, including user activity for the business-critical aspects of your app. Using these powerful APIs, you can add custom instrumentation to just about anything. The following are some example use cases. How to do it Track and query feature use Use custom events to track feature use. For example: Use custom events to track user flow between app and website. Use custom events or mobile breadcrumbs to optimize the performance of key user flows (log in, shopping cart, etc.). use custom events to provide faster, contextualized support experiences for your digital customers. Use the recordCustomEvent API. Then compare the use of different features using: SELECT count(*) FROM MyNewMobileEventType FACET name Copy Measure page load times Use custom events to measure page load time: Create an app-launch timer to measure the time that elapses between a user-tap to launch your app and the point in your app code where the first screen is available. Record the timer value in New Relic using something like the following: recordCustomEvent(<myMobileTimers>, <appLaunch>, {attributes}) Copy Define start and stop timers to measure spinner durations, and then record this time in New Relic using something like the following: recordCustomEvent(<myMobileTimers>, <spinnerOnScreenA>, {attributes}) Copy Track specific user actions or funnel steps in the app (like \"add to cart\"), and include the price as an attribute on that event. Measure flows through the application by viewing the related funnel steps with custom events in Insights. For example, create a timer to track the start and end times of a subflow or an entire flow across multiple funnel steps to understand how long it took users to get through the process. Examine data about webpage interactions Use custom interactions to see traces associated with the same webpages. Use the agent API to disable default interactions, and focus on custom interactions so that you can review the page loads that are most crucial to your primary funnel. Define the start and stop times of these custom interactions to trace activities associated with individual steps of that funnel (for example, a specific user action or a page load). Track the last interactions of crashed and non-crashed sessions so that you can see what the user viewed before exiting your app (either intentionally or from a crash). Example query for non-crashed sessions: SELECT count(*) FROM Mobile WHERE sessionCrashed is null FACET lastInteraction SINCE 90 days ago Copy Example query for crashed sessions: SELECT count(*) FROM Mobile WHERE sessionCrashed is true FACET lastInteraction SINCE 90 days ago Copy",

      "body": "Browser monitoring tips & tricks that every user should know Get more out of browser monitoring, with deeper visibility into your websites and your users. Here are 10 best practices to help you find problems faster and deliver a better experience to your customers with real user monitoring. 1. Use browser SPA agent Use the browser SPA agent for deeper visibility Modern websites are complex, with dynamic content and sophisticated logic. See deeper into your user interactions, enable the single-page application (SPA) agent for browser and gain visibility into your user actions and the underlying webpage events behind them. This framework-agnostic agent is not only for single-page application frameworks like React, Angular, Ember, or Backbone, but also for custom frameworks and any other pages with dynamic content. Advanced timing analytics provide more granularity into Navigation Timing Specification API sub-timings beyond page rendering or DOM processing, with detailed performance data filtering useful for understanding all page lifecycles. How to do it From the browser app list, select an app, then select Settings > Application Settings. Select Pro + SPA. Click Save application settings Change your browser monitoring settings to switch to SPA. 2. Use APM auto-instrumentation Use APM automatic instrumentation over copy/paste If you’re also a APM customer, we recommend enabling automatic instrumentation where possible, as this will automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript agent into your frontend for you. Not only will the browser agent remain automatically up to date with this approach, using these products together helps unify frontend to backend visibility. For example, you’d be able to link frontend AJAX calls to their corresponding backend transaction, and to align your frontend and backend data together in an Insights dashboard. Tip Depending on your backend framework or CDN strategy, a copy/paste approach may be the better strategy. Just remember that it’ll require periodic updating. How to do it Select Settings > Application Settings. Select Enable via New Relic APM. Select Pro + SPA agent. Click Save application settings. one.newrelic.com > Browser > Settings > Application Settings 3. Customize Apdex Customize your Apdex threshold New Relic uses Apdex, an industry-standard metric, to measure users’ satisfaction with the response time of your applications. Apdex converts many measurements into one number on a uniform scale of 0 to 1 (0 = no users satisfied, 1 = all users satisfied). Apdex T is the central value for Apdex—it is the response time below which a transaction is considered “Satisfactory.” You can define Apdex T values for each application, with separate values for app server and end-user browser performance. (Note that many modern websites are bottlenecked primarily in the frontend browser, accounting for 90% or more of pageload times.) While a suggested T-value threshold is 5 seconds, we encourage you to customize your Apdex T value to fit the needs of your users and application. For example, an ecommerce site may want to have a lower T value to reduce bounce rates from potential buyers frustrated by a slow experience, compared to an internal employee application. However, the goal is to continually lower T-values over time to improve your digital customer experience. How to do it From the browser app list, select an app, then select Settings > Application settings. Set the Apdex T value (in seconds) for this application. Click Save application settings. one.newrelic.com > Browser > Settings > Application 4. Create alerts Create and evaluate alert policies What happens if your Apdex score exceeds your threshold? You want to be alerted whenever this happens, so that you can investigate what is causing the issue before you lose any customers. New Relic provides unified alerting across all our products, including browser monitoring, so that you’ll always be in the know. We recommend setting up alerts to monitor your Apdex score, along with these sample alerts to get you started: Apdex score: Alert if score is below 0.8 for 5 minutes. (If the Apdex score is below 0.8, that means 20% or more of your users are not “satisfied” with their experience on your website.) Page load time: Alert if median page load time is above 10 seconds for 5 minutes. (If the median page load time begins to spike, that suggest that something may be wrong with your web page causing it to significantly slow down. This complements alerting on your Apdex score.) JS errors: Alert if error rate is above 5% for 5 minutes. (If your frontend error rate starts spiking, particularly after a deployment, you may have introduced bad JavaScript into your frontend that should be fixed.) How to do it From Alerts & AI, select Go to Alerts, and click on Policies on the left column. Select (+) New alert policy to create a new alert policy, and give it a meaningful name. Click on Create a condition to create your first condition, then select Browser for your product and the Metric for the condition (which should be the default). Then click Next, select entities. Click the checkbox for the applications you want to alert on, and click Next, define thresholds. Pick the metrics of interest and their thresholds that determine when to trigger an alert. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Policies > New alert policy 5. Use baseline alerts Alert on anomalous behaviors and events While some metrics can be easily tracked against specific thresholds, other types of data can be more cyclical or have variable ranges for what’s considered healthy. Traffic throughput is a good example of this; it can have significantly cycles, but large traffic drops or spikes may be important indicators of a breakage preventing user traffic or a DDoS attack spiking traffic. Baseline alerts can be helpful for creating an expected \"band\" of normal activity to create more signal to noise in your alerting. How to do it From Alerts & AI, select Go to Alerts, and click on Policies on the left column. Select (+) New alert policy to create a new alert policy, and give it a meaningful name. Click on Create a condition to create your first condition, select Browser for your product and the Metric Baseline for the condition (which should be the default). Then click Next, select entities. Click the checkbox for the applications you want to alert on, and click Next, define thresholds. Pick the Page view throughput and use the slider to define the normal range you want to trigger the alert. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Policies > New alert policy 6. Add alerts to workflows Integrate your alerts into your workflows With the different alerting policies that you’re setting up, you’ll want to make sure to take advantage of the different alert notification channels available so that they’re integrated into team workflows. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can route alerts through Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks, email, and more. You also have the opportunity to align alert notifications with your response processes, such as integrating with ChatOps or linking runbooks to your alerts. Be sure to evaluate alert policies on a regular basis to ensure that they are always valid. How to do it From Alerts & AI, click on Notification channels. Set up different notification channels, which can then be used within different alerting policies. 7. Create dashboards Create your own dashboards using New Relic Insights Browser automatically provides a curated experience to quickly triage issues, but you can also create bespoke dashboards with your frontend data with the query builder. Build unique real-time overviews of what’s going on in your frontend, and see how it fits with the rest of your technology stack. For example, you can: Create a browser-specific breakdown of percentiles, durations, and page views: SELECT average(duration),percentile(duration,50,75,95) as 'Percentile', count(*) as 'Pageviews' FROM PageView WHERE userAgentName='Chrome' SINCE 1 week ago Copy Break down route change performance into percentiles: SELECT count(*) as 'Route Change', average(duration) as 'Avg PageLoad',percentile(duration,50,75) as '%' ,average(jsDuration) as 'JS Duration' FROM BrowserInteraction FACET targetUrl where category = 'Route change' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Compare frontend performance to backend performance in APM: SELECT average(duration) as 'Avg Frontend Duration', average(backendDuration) FROM PageView SINCE 2 minutes ago UNTIL 10 seconds ago TIMESERIES Copy These individual widgets can be added together to create a team dashboard that’s shared across different engineering teams and the company. You can bring together web and mobile application data, backend data, infrastructure data, synthetic monitoring data, and more, all on a single custom dashboard across New Relic One. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards How to do it Go to one.newrelic.com, then click Query your data to access the query builder. In the NRQL tab of the query builder, paste the query into the NRQL> query bar and click Run. Type in a widget title, and add to either an existing or a new dashboard. Go to Dashboards to see your new dashboard. For more information, see our docs on data querying and dashboards. 8. Group your data Group your data into meaningful categories Different websites have different URL architectures, which can vary depending on content structure, technology framework, or SEO strategy. For example: website.com/product/widget-name website.com/gallery?product=109832 website.com/gallery/housewares/lamps/widget-name website.com/product#widget-name URL structure possibilities are endless, so browser includes an automatic grouping algorithm to set categories for that data into different URL groups. We recommend using URL grouping allowed lists to customize how your data is grouped together, which makes the corresponding performance information more useful and aligned to your website architecture. If the data generated by this default grouping is too high level, creating a URL grouping will disaggregate the data and give you greater granularity to make it more useful. For example, you could group by: Different page types: product pages vs. search pages Different forms, APIs, or user groupings Mobile vs. non-mobile Authenticated vs. non-authenticated Different content delivery networks (CDNs) How to do it In the browser monitoring UI, select Settings > Segment allow lists. In the Allow listed segments section, click on the + icon. Type in the URL segments you want to appear in groupings on the page views and AJAX pages. one.newrelic.com > Browser > Settings > Segment allow lists. 9. Get the right data Make sure you get data only from the right sources Browser data is generated from wherever your JavaScript agent is instrumented, though copies of your agent might become duplicated, such as through development, staging, or other environments, resulting in additional data being included from these sources that you would not want mixed with your production data. You can use domain conditions to allow or deny data from the different website domains you want monitored. How to do it In the browser monitoring UI, select Settings > Domain conditions. If there are no domain conditions in place, select Enable domain conditions. If conditions exist, select Next, Choose your setting. Select Deny only or Allow only to identify the data you want collected from the domains you want monitored. Then select Next, Create conditions. Enter the domain string conditions that you want to deny or allow data collection (maximum 10 conditions). Review and confirm your domain condition settings. one.newrelic.com > Browser > Settings > Domain conditions. 10. Break down performance data Break down performance across your users, business, and more By leveraging New Relic APIs, you can add vital context to your performance data as it relates to your technology, users, and your business. All our monitoring tools send their data to New Relic One, which enables plenty of customization and extensibility in your dashboarding. Just be sure to standardize naming for custom events and attributes across different data sources (such as between browser and mobile) for omnichannel engagement. Here are some examples of what you can measure: Build id: Pass in a build number to A/B test differences between versions User id: Manage your VIP customers and track their experience Cart value: Understand how much revenue is at risk when errors occur during checkout Content type: Track the type of content your users are viewing Video playback: See how users are consuming your media content The possibilities are endless.

      "body": "Browser monitoring tips & tricks that every user should know Get more out of browser monitoring, with deeper visibility into your websites and your users. Here are 10 best practices to help you find problems faster and deliver a better experience to your customers with real user monitoring. 1. Use browser SPA agent Use the browser SPA agent for deeper visibility Modern websites are complex, with dynamic content and sophisticated logic. See deeper into your user interactions, enable the single-page application (SPA) agent for browser and gain visibility into your user actions and the underlying webpage events behind them. This framework-agnostic agent is not only for single-page application frameworks like React, Angular, Ember, or Backbone, but also for custom frameworks and any other pages with dynamic content. Advanced timing analytics provide more granularity into Navigation Timing Specification API sub-timings beyond page rendering or DOM processing, with detailed performance data filtering useful for understanding all page lifecycles. How to do it From the browser app list, select an app, then select Settings > Application Settings. Select Pro + SPA. Click Save application settings Change your browser monitoring settings to switch to SPA. 2. Use APM auto-instrumentation Use APM automatic instrumentation over copy/paste If you’re also a APM customer, we recommend enabling automatic instrumentation where possible, as this will automatically inject the browser monitoring JavaScript agent into your frontend for you. Not only will the browser agent remain automatically up to date with this approach, using these products together helps unify frontend to backend visibility. For example, you’d be able to link frontend AJAX calls to their corresponding backend transaction, and to align your frontend and backend data together in an Insights dashboard. Tip Depending on your backend framework or CDN strategy, a copy/paste approach may be the better strategy. Just remember that it’ll require periodic updating. How to do it Select Settings > Application Settings. Select Enable via New Relic APM. Select Pro + SPA agent. Click Save application settings. one.newrelic.com > Browser > Settings > Application Settings 3. Customize Apdex Customize your Apdex threshold New Relic uses Apdex, an industry-standard metric, to measure users’ satisfaction with the response time of your applications. Apdex converts many measurements into one number on a uniform scale of 0 to 1 (0 = no users satisfied, 1 = all users satisfied). Apdex T is the central value for Apdex—it is the response time below which a transaction is considered “Satisfactory.” You can define Apdex T values for each application, with separate values for app server and end-user browser performance. (Note that many modern websites are bottlenecked primarily in the frontend browser, accounting for 90% or more of pageload times.) While a suggested T-value threshold is 5 seconds, we encourage you to customize your Apdex T value to fit the needs of your users and application. For example, an ecommerce site may want to have a lower T value to reduce bounce rates from potential buyers frustrated by a slow experience, compared to an internal employee application. However, the goal is to continually lower T-values over time to improve your digital customer experience. How to do it From the browser app list, select an app, then select Settings > Application settings. Set the Apdex T value (in seconds) for this application. Click Save application settings. one.newrelic.com > Browser > Settings > Application 4. Create alerts Create and evaluate alert policies What happens if your Apdex score exceeds your threshold? You want to be alerted whenever this happens, so that you can investigate what is causing the issue before you lose any customers. New Relic provides unified alerting across all our products, including browser monitoring, so that you’ll always be in the know. We recommend setting up alerts to monitor your Apdex score, along with these sample alerts to get you started: Apdex score: Alert if score is below 0.8 for 5 minutes. (If the Apdex score is below 0.8, that means 20% or more of your users are not “satisfied” with their experience on your website.) Page load time: Alert if median page load time is above 10 seconds for 5 minutes. (If the median page load time begins to spike, that suggest that something may be wrong with your web page causing it to significantly slow down. This complements alerting on your Apdex score.) JS errors: Alert if error rate is above 5% for 5 minutes. (If your frontend error rate starts spiking, particularly after a deployment, you may have introduced bad JavaScript into your frontend that should be fixed.) How to do it From Alerts & AI, select Go to Alerts, and click on Policies on the left column. Select (+) New alert policy to create a new alert policy, and give it a meaningful name. Click on Create a condition to create your first condition, then select Browser for your product and the Metric for the condition (which should be the default). Then click Next, select entities. Click the checkbox for the applications you want to alert on, and click Next, define thresholds. Pick the metrics of interest and their thresholds that determine when to trigger an alert. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Policies > New alert policy 5. Use baseline alerts Alert on anomalous behaviors and events While some metrics can be easily tracked against specific thresholds, other types of data can be more cyclical or have variable ranges for what’s considered healthy. Traffic throughput is a good example of this; it can have significantly cycles, but large traffic drops or spikes may be important indicators of a breakage preventing user traffic or a DDoS attack spiking traffic. Baseline alerts can be helpful for creating an expected \"band\" of normal activity to create more signal to noise in your alerting. How to do it From Alerts & AI, select Go to Alerts, and click on Policies on the left column. Select (+) New alert policy to create a new alert policy, and give it a meaningful name. Click on Create a condition to create your first condition, select Browser for your product and the Metric Baseline for the condition (which should be the default). Then click Next, select entities. Click the checkbox for the applications you want to alert on, and click Next, define thresholds. Pick the Page view throughput and use the slider to define the normal range you want to trigger the alert. one.newrelic.com > Alerts & AI > Policies > New alert policy 6. Add alerts to workflows Integrate your alerts into your workflows With the different alerting policies that you’re setting up, you’ll want to make sure to take advantage of the different alert notification channels available so that they’re integrated into team workflows. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can route alerts through Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks, email, and more. You also have the opportunity to align alert notifications with your response processes, such as integrating with ChatOps or linking runbooks to your alerts. Be sure to evaluate alert policies on a regular basis to ensure that they are always valid. How to do it From Alerts & AI, click on Notification channels. Set up different notification channels, which can then be used within different alerting policies. 7. Create dashboards Create your own dashboards using New Relic Insights Browser automatically provides a curated experience to quickly triage issues, but you can also create bespoke dashboards with your frontend data with the query builder. Build unique real-time overviews of what’s going on in your frontend, and see how it fits with the rest of your technology stack. For example, you can: Create a browser-specific breakdown of percentiles, durations, and page views: SELECT average(duration),percentile(duration,50,75,95) as 'Percentile', count(*) as 'Pageviews' FROM PageView WHERE userAgentName='Chrome' SINCE 1 week ago Copy Break down route change performance into percentiles: SELECT count(*) as 'Route Change', average(duration) as 'Avg PageLoad',percentile(duration,50,75) as '%' ,average(jsDuration) as 'JS Duration' FROM BrowserInteraction FACET targetUrl where category = 'Route change' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Compare frontend performance to backend performance in APM: SELECT average(duration) as 'Avg Frontend Duration', average(backendDuration) FROM PageView SINCE 2 minutes ago UNTIL 10 seconds ago TIMESERIES Copy These individual widgets can be added together to create a team dashboard that’s shared across different engineering teams and the company. You can bring together web and mobile application data, backend data, infrastructure data, synthetic monitoring data, and more, all on a single custom dashboard across New Relic One. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards How to do it Go to one.newrelic.com, then click Query your data to access the query builder. In the NRQL tab of the query builder, paste the query into the NRQL> query bar and click Run. Type in a widget title, and add to either an existing or a new dashboard. Go to Dashboards to see your new dashboard. For more information, see our docs on data querying and dashboards. 8. Group your data Group your data into meaningful categories Different websites have different URL architectures, which can vary depending on content structure, technology framework, or SEO strategy. For example: website.com/product/widget-name website.com/gallery?product=109832 website.com/gallery/housewares/lamps/widget-name website.com/product#widget-name URL structure possibilities are endless, so browser includes an automatic grouping algorithm to set categories for that data into different URL groups. We recommend using URL grouping allowed lists to customize how your data is grouped together, which makes the corresponding performance information more useful and aligned to your website architecture. If the data generated by this default grouping is too high level, creating a URL grouping will disaggregate the data and give you greater granularity to make it more useful. For example, you could group by: Different page types: product pages vs. search pages Different forms, APIs, or user groupings Mobile vs. non-mobile Authenticated vs. non-authenticated Different content delivery networks (CDNs) How to do it In the browser monitoring UI, select Settings > Segment allow lists. In the Allow listed segments section, click on the + icon. Type in the URL segments you want to appear in groupings on the page views and AJAX pages. one.newrelic.com > Browser > Settings > Segment allow lists. 9. Get the right data Make sure you get data only from the right sources Browser data is generated from wherever your JavaScript agent is instrumented, though copies of your agent might become duplicated, such as through development, staging, or other environments, resulting in additional data being included from these sources that you would not want mixed with your production data. You can use domain conditions to allow or deny data from the different website domains you want monitored. How to do it In the browser monitoring UI, select Settings > Domain conditions. If there are no domain conditions in place, select Enable domain conditions. If conditions exist, select Next, Choose your setting. Select Deny only or Allow only to identify the data you want collected from the domains you want monitored. Then select Next, Create conditions. Enter the domain string conditions that you want to deny or allow data collection (maximum 10 conditions). Review and confirm your domain condition settings. one.newrelic.com > Browser > Settings > Domain conditions. 10. Break down performance data Break down performance across your users, business, and more By leveraging New Relic APIs, you can add vital context to your performance data as it relates to your technology, users, and your business. All our monitoring tools send their data to New Relic One, which enables plenty of customization and extensibility in your dashboarding. Just be sure to standardize naming for custom events and attributes across different data sources (such as between browser and mobile) for omnichannel engagement. Here are some examples of what you can measure: Build id: Pass in a build number to A/B test differences between versions User id: Manage your VIP customers and track their experience Cart value: Understand how much revenue is at risk when errors occur during checkout Content type: Track the type of content your users are viewing Video playback: See how users are consuming your media content The possibilities are endless. And as you can see, this type of reporting creates context around how your application performance impacts the rest of the business. How to do it Use our APIs to pass custom data about people, things, money, and more into New Relic One. Visit one.newrelic.com, and query on the custom data that is now available.

For information on how to set up browser monitoring for your Java app, see Browser monitoring and the Java agent. Ensure you are using the Apache Jasper compiler. The New Relic Java agent only auto-instruments pages compiled with the Apache Jasper compiler. The following application servers use the Jasper compiler by default: Tomcat Jetty Glassfish JBoss 4 Place meta tags immediately after the initial head tag. Recommendation: Place all <meta> tags immediately after the initial <head> tag. Some meta tags have requirements on how close they need to be to the beginning of an HTML document. The character encoding must be declared within the first 512 bytes of the HTML document. If the New Relic header is placed before the character encoding, it is possible for the character encoding to then be outside that 512 byte limit. Placing the character encoding meta tag immediately after the <head> tag will ensure that the New Relic header is positioned after the character encoding. <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta charset=\"utf-8\"> <%= com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() %> . . . </head> Copy The X-UA-Compatible meta tag should be within the meta tags immediately after the <head> tag. This tag allows page authors to set the document mode used for rending the page in Internet Explorer. This tag should be placed before any script tags. If the New Relic header is positioned before the X-UA-Compatible meta tag, the page might display incorrectly in Internet Explorer. <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=9\"> <%= com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic.getBrowserTimingHeader() %> . . . </head> Copy Avoid if ... else statements in the head section. The auto instrumentation script does not recognize if ... else statements within a JSP page. If you have an if ... else block before your first non-meta, non-title tag, the New Relic header might be placed in the incorrect position in the page. For example, this code could potentially cause the auto instrumentation script to be inserted before the meta tags: if (expression) { <nonmeta tag> } <meta tag> <meta tag> Copy Avoid expressions with the less than sign in the head section. The New Relic Java agent looks for the open angle bracket < to mark the beginning of an HTML tag. This means if you have an expression using a less than sign, then you will either need to change your expression to use a greater than sign or use manual instrumentation. For example: <head> <% for (i = 0; i < variable; i++) . . . %> Copy",

Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click the Guided install button. If your account reports data through our EU datacenter, click EU Guided install. Guided install EU Guided install Our infrastructure agent discovers the applications and infrastructure and log sources running in your environment, and recommends which ones should be instrumented. The install automates the configuration and deployment of each system you choose to instrument. Supported APM agents If you have a .NET Windows application on IIS, the guided install configures and enables an APM agent. Guided install for .NET EU Guided install for .NET Why it matters With our guided install, you can instrument your applications and infrastructure and start seeing your data in New Relic in minutes. The guided install uses our command line interface (CLI), the infrastructure agent for your host environment, and a library of installation recipes to instrument your applications and infrastructure for you. That means less toil for you. Because our instrumentation recipes are open source, you can modify existing recipes, or build new ones, to suit your needs. Some technical detail The New Relic guided install uses open source installation recipes to instrument on-host integrations. These recipes include installation and setup commands, information about logs, and metadata related to what’s being installed. They're collected in a YAML file for each type of system and have all of the installation details necessary to install the infrastructure agent for a specific integration. Important On Windows, our guided install only supports Microsoft SQL Server, logs, and the infrastructure agent. All other integrations are only supported on Linux. On-host integration (OHI) recipes The guided install automates the discovery, configuration, and installation of OHIs. However, there may be times when you want to instrument them one-by-one using the CLI install command. To install any individual on-host integration, run this command: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=API_KEY NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=ACCOUNT_ID /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n INTEGRATION-FLAG Copy For example: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=<API_KEY> NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=<ACCOUNT_ID> /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n apache-open-source-integration Copy The table lists the integrations supported by the guided install CLI command. The specific on-host integration commands are provided for your reference. Our open source integrations send performance metrics and inventory data from your servers and applications to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts.

      "body": "Application Monitoring Tips You Need To Know It's one thing to know how to use APM, but it's another thing to know how to use New Relic's application performance monitoring software well. Here are some best practices designed to help you become an APM master—and a key asset to your team! Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. 1. Standardize application names Most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as \"My Application\" or \"PHP Application,\" if you don't specify one in your New Relic configuration file. You don't want to end up with 20 identically named applications, be sure to select a descriptive identifier for your apps as soon you deploy them. To keep things consistent and easy to navigate, New Relic recommends standardizing your application naming (for example, all apps in Staging append [ Staging] or the like at the end of their names). Ideally, you want your new Java applications to be named automatically to reduce the chances of typographical errors and misnaming. How to do it For Java applications, automatic application naming can come from the following sources: Request attribute Servlet init parameter Filter init parameter Web app context parameter Web app context name (display name) Web app context path Choose the method that fits best your needs and follow these steps. For non-Java applications, there are no automatic naming methods, so refer to the documentation for your APM agent. 2. Add tags to your applications When several different applications use the same account, and each application spans multiple environments (for example, development, test, pre-production, production), it can be hard to find a specific application in your overview dashboard. That's why we recommend adding tags to your apps so that you can segment them into logical groups. The two most common tags that mature APM customers use are application name and environment. So, for example, if you wanted to view the billing application in Test, you could simply filter by \"billing app\" (name tag) and \"test\" (environment tag). Caution In the APM agent configuration settings files, use the labels field to add tags to your data. For example, see this description of the Python labels setting. APM is designed so that apps can roll up into an unlimited number of meaningful tag categories. How to do it Learn about tags. Learn how to add tags.. Learn how to query tags. 3. Create and evaluate alert policies When key performance indicators spike or drop, individuals and teams in your organization need to be notified. Alerting in New Relic provides a set of tools including dynamic baselines that allow you to detect problems before they impact your end users. Alert policies can be set up in two primary ways: Static threshold alerts are great when you already know the nature of an application and its normal behaviors aren't likely to change anytime soon. Apdex score, response time, error rate, throughput are some of the static thresholds you can create alert policies on. Dynamic baseline alerts make it easy to determine and set dynamic alert thresholds for applications with varying seasonal patterns and growth trends (which make it difficult to set thresholds that define normal behavior). These alerts use baselines modeled from your application’s historical metric data. Each alert policy can contain as many conditions as you need, and each alert condition includes three components: Type of condition (metric, external service, and so on) Entities that the policy targets (for example, APM apps, browser monitoring apps, or hosts) Thresholds that escalate into alerting situations with increasing severity Once you have your alerting set up, you then want to make sure you're taking advantage of all viable notification channels. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can manage alerts by creating specific user groups and by leveraging New Relic's integrated alert channels, including Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks, and email. Be sure to evaluate alert policies on a regular basis to ensure that they are always valid. How to do it See the detailed documentation: To set up dynamic baseline alerts and choose an application, follow standard procedures. You will see a preview of the metric with the predicted baseline You can select a metric for that application and see the corresponding baseline. Then, using the threshold sliders, you can set how closely you want your threshold to follow the baseline prediction. To set up static threshold alerts for your Apdex settings, follow standard procedures. To set up your alert notification channels, follow standard procedures. 4. Identify and set up key transactions Depending on the nature of your application, some transactions may be more important to you than others. New Relic's key transactions feature is designed to help you closely monitor what you consider to be your app's most business-critical transactions, whether that's end-user or app response time, call counts, error rates, or something else. You can also set alert threshold levels for notifications when your key transactions are performing poorly. How to do it In the menu bar, select More > Key transactions, and then select Add more. Then select the app and web transaction or, from the selected transaction, select Track as key transaction. Type a name for the key transaction, and select Track key transaction. Optional: If the agent for the selected app supports custom alerting, use the default values that New Relic automatically fills, or select Edit key alert transaction policy to set the Apdex and alert threshold values. To view the key transactions dashboard details, select View new key transaction. 5. Track deployment history When development teams are pushing new code out as frequently as possible, it can be hard to measure the impact that each deployment is having on performance. One way to stay in tune with how these changes are affecting your application is with deployment reports. These reports list recent deployments and their impact on end-users and app servers' Apdex scores, along with response times, throughput, and errors. You can also view and drill down into the details to catch errors related to recent deployments, or file a ticket and share details with your team. How to do it From the New Relic menu bar, select APM > (selected app) > Events > Deployments. To view performance after a deployment, go to the selected app's Overview dashboard in the Recent events section. A blue vertical bar on a chart indicates a deployment. To view summary information about the deployment, point to the blue bar. 6. Review APM reports From SLA, deployment, and capacity to scalability, host usage reports, and more, New Relic APM offers a variety of downloadable reporting tools surfacing historical trends—all great ways to report to senior executive teams or customers. Take a look at the full list of reports and use them to your advantage. How to do it From the New Relic APM menu bar, select Applications > (selected app) > Reports. Select the report you'd like to see. If you want to save or export a report to share, select Download this report as .csv, which will create a report with comma-separated values. 7. Review your environment with service maps Use New Relic service maps, a feature included in APM, to understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and talk to each other. Service maps are visual, customizable representations of your application architecture. Maps automatically show you your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. How to do it Go to one.newrelic.com > More > service maps. To get started, read the instructions in Introduction to service maps. 8. Keep current With New Relic’s SaaS platform, getting new features is as easy as updating your agent. Most likely your organization already has a set of scripts for deploying application upgrades into your environment. In a similar fashion, you can also automate your New Relic agent deployment to ensure that your systems are up to date. Both Puppet and Chef scripts are great examples of deployment frameworks that make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. How to do it Regularly review which version of the agent you're using so that you know when an update is needed. If the latest agent release contains a needed fix or added functionality, download it. To deploy the agent automatically (preferred as a method to avoid errors): Use existing deployment scripts, provided they can be adapted to handle the deployment. OR Create and maintain a script that specifically deploys and configures the New Relic agent. Ideally, the script would pull the agent files from a repository where the files are versioned (for rollback purposes). Once the script has been created, shut down the application (unless script handles this). Run the deployment script. Start the application (unless script handles this). If problems arise, run the script to roll back to the previous version. To deploy the agent manually: Back up the current agent directory. Deploy the updated agent into the existing agent directory. Modify configuration files by comparing new files with existing files. In particular, make sure things like license key and custom extensions are copied over to the new configuration. Restart the application. If problems arise, restore the old agent using the backup and restart. 9. Manage user access Important This is available only for accounts on our original product-based pricing plan. Enable role-based access control (RBAC) and single sign-on (SSO) New Relic allows authorized individuals to access the broadest possible amount of data, regardless of their assigned role. As an Owner or Administrator of your New Relic account, you can control the permissions of individual users or entire roles with RBAC. To find out what is possible and how to make changes, see Users and roles. Security is no doubt of utmost concern to your organization. To simplify password management for your employees and strengthen security, you may already be using SSO with your other systems. You should do the same with New Relic. Using New Relic's SSO integration feature, account administrators will be able to enforce strong passwords and restrict login via a corporate authentication mechanism. This way, New Relic users who have already authenticated using a corporate SSO system will be able to bypass the New Relic login prompt. How to do it Log in to New Relic as an admin and go to the SSO configuration page. From the New Relic title bar, select (your account name) > Account Settings > Integrations > Single Sign On. From the SAML Single Sign On page, review your New Relic SAML Service Provider details. To upload your SAML Identity Provider certificate, select Choose File, and then follow standard procedures to select and save the file. Copy and paste in (or type) the Remove login URL that your users will use for Single Sign-On. If your organization’s SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, copy and paste in (or type) the Logout landing URL; otherwise leave blank. Save, test, and enable.",

      "body": "By eliminating crashes and increasing speed across the stack, you can build better performance into every mobile app release. Here are some best practices to take full advantage of mobile monitoring with New Relic. 1. Start collecting data Start collecting data in production. You'll see immediate value by adding our mobile monitoring SDK to your app for its next release to the app store. We recommend installing the iOS or Android agent to your production release even if you're simply testing New Relic's capabilities. This will ensure you'll get an adequate amount of data to really understand all of our mobile monitoring capabilities and your end users' experience. How to do it Add your mobile app to New Relic First, add a new app in New Relic's user interface (full steps): Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. From the list of monitored apps, select Add more. Select the relevant platform. Type a name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Use one app and the associated app token for the development releases of your iOS app, another app and its associated app token for the production releases of that iOS app, and another pair of app tokens for development and production releases of your Android app. You'll be able to compare data from across the four app tokens using our query builder. Install and configure our mobile SDK Next, install and configure the mobile agent: Download the latest version of New Relic's SDK for iOS or Android, and add it to your mobile app. (Full steps for iOS and Android) Configure your installation as needed. For example: Enable the feature flag to capture MobileRequest events to use our full network analysis capabilities for iOS or Android. Automate dSYM uploads for your production builds. To avoid surprises, follow the standard pattern of where you start our mobile agent. In addition, start our agent before you initiate any other SDKs. For more information, see our documentation for Android installation and configuration and for iOS installation and configuration. Deploy a new release of your application. 2. Explore your data Immediately be able to explore your data. As soon as New Relic starts reporting data, take the time to explore the wealth of information about your mobile apps. To get started, go to one.newrelic.com and select Mobile. How to do it Analyze, resolve, and prevent crashes Find the cause of crashes so you can fix them. Then, uncover trends behind crashes so you can prevent them: From the summary UI page for a monitored mobile app, click Crash analysis. Analyze crash data so you can see and fix the most impactful crashes. Follow the breadcrumbs in the crash event trail to fix crashes and resolve critical errors more easily: From your mobile app's Crash analysis page in the UI, select a Crash type. From the crash type's Summary page, select the Crash trail tab. For more information, see our blog post about crash analysis. Monitor your key workflows Create custom breadcrumbs to monitor key workflows (such as your app's login or checkout process), track user clicks, optimize timing, and identify crash locations for faster MTTR. Get actionable session data Borrow from our example queries to: See how much of your user base has upgraded to your latest app version. Track adoption over time. Get a count of new installs as compared to upgrades from an earlier version. See the distribution of usage across geographical locations, carriers, ASN owners (wi-fi providers), devices, connection types, and more. 3. Take preventive steps Use alert notifications to help uncover the causes behind crashes and errors. Once you are running our mobile monitoring capabilities in production and have explored some of the key features, you can use New Relic to uncover critical issues with your mobile application. In particular, focus on crashes and errors. Use metric-based alerts as a starting point to gain high-level visibility into problems. Then, as new services or functionalities are added, use New Relic’s more targeted, event-based (NRQL) alerts to make sure that the most critical issues are handled swiftly. Use these alerts to determine whether a crash is impacting a large number of users. If it is, the relevant people (for example, both the mobile app team’s on-call member and the owner of the related back-end service) will be alerted. Make sure that your team knows how to respond to changes in crash rate (crashes per sessions) and the percentage of users impacted by crashes of your mobile app. How to do it Metric-based alerts Use our metric-based alerts and mobile monitoring UI: Ensure that key members of your mobile team have opted in to receive emails for new crashes. These emails will take you to the crash type in the UI page for your mobile app. Create an alert for your crash rate threshold that key members of your team can view in Slack or any other Alerts notification channel you choose. Your alert notification will include a link to our UI, where you can examine a chart with the exceeded threshold. From there, a link will take you to the relevant mobile monitoring page, where you can get additional details. Event-based alerts Combine the metric-based workflow with event-based alerts and dashboards specific to your mobile app and system. Create your NRQL alert that focuses on crashes of your most recently released production version. Create an additional NRQL alert that focuses on the percentage of users impacted by crashes in your latest app version (to check the overall impact on your user base). 4. Dig deeper into crashes Take your crash reporting to the next level. Now it’s time to tackle some of those harder-to-reproduce crashes by: Applying additional instrumentation to your application. Leveraging crash event trails, NRQL queries, and dashboards to visualize your data. How to do it Crash analysis Crashes are an inevitable part of running mobile applications at scale. We provide tools to help you understand your highest-impact crashes. Use the Crash analysis UI to see which crashes are occurring most often, the percentage of crash-free users, which files and methods are associated with perhaps 80 percent of your crashes, which crashes a particular user just experienced, and more. Go after high-impact crashes with crash analysis: Add custom attributes to categorize the highest-value customers, and then use them to segment crashes according to your most valuable audiences. Add breadcrumbs and custom events to produce a detailed trail of events leading up to every crash occurrence (over the last 90 days). Then, view this crash event trail in our mobile monitoring UI. Use our mobile monitoring's Versions trends page to make sure you’re improving the crash rate over subsequent releases and avoiding regressions. Breadcrumbs Use breadcrumbs and custom attributes to better reproduce and debug crashes. For example, use our recordBreadrumb API for Android or iOS to track mid-session changes in state that can help debug crashes, such as: Change of connection type Change of orientation CPU and memory state at key points in the app code Custom attributes Add custom attributes to existing events, so you can ask even more precise questions of your mobile app. Add dimensions such as: User ID: Use to react to specific user concerns and to better understand which customers and segments are most impacted. Store ID: Use to address problems with out-of-date devices, bad wi-fi, and so on. User segments: Use to better understand which customers and segments are most impacted; for example, logged in vs. non-logged in. Money in the cart at session end Origin or attribution of entry into the app Standardize custom attribute names across your mobile apps, and align with your website (if you're using our browser monitoring), so that you can compare and contrast performance across end-user channels. The mobile agents track the last interaction of crashed and non-crashed sessions to provide visibility into what the user viewed before exiting your app (either intentionally or due to a crash). 5. Focus on KPIs Bring your key performance indicators to life. Create custom interactions and events to hone in on the most important signals, including user activity for the business-critical aspects of your app. Using these powerful APIs, you can add custom instrumentation to just about anything. The following are some example use cases. How to do it Track and query feature use Use custom events to track feature use. For example: Use custom events to track user flow between app and website. Use custom events or mobile breadcrumbs to optimize the performance of key user flows (log in, shopping cart, etc.). use custom events to provide faster, contextualized support experiences for your digital customers. Use the recordCustomEvent API. Then compare the use of different features using: SELECT count(*) FROM MyNewMobileEventType FACET name Copy Measure page load times Use custom events to measure page load time: Create an app-launch timer to measure the time that elapses between a user-tap to launch your app and the point in your app code where the first screen is available. Record the timer value in New Relic using something like the following: recordCustomEvent(<myMobileTimers>, <appLaunch>, {attributes}) Copy Define start and stop timers to measure spinner durations, and then record this time in New Relic using something like the following: recordCustomEvent(<myMobileTimers>, <spinnerOnScreenA>, {attributes}) Copy Track specific user actions or funnel steps in the app (like \"add to cart\"), and include the price as an attribute on that event. Measure flows through the application by viewing the related funnel steps with custom events in Insights. For example, create a timer to track the start and end times of a subflow or an entire flow across multiple funnel steps to understand how long it took users to get through the process. Examine data about webpage interactions Use custom interactions to see traces associated with the same webpages. Use the agent API to disable default interactions, and focus on custom interactions so that you can review the page loads that are most crucial to your primary funnel. Define the start and stop times of these custom interactions to trace activities associated with individual steps of that funnel (for example, a specific user action or a page load). Track the last interactions of crashed and non-crashed sessions so that you can see what the user viewed before exiting your app (either intentionally or from a crash). Example query for non-crashed sessions: SELECT count(*) FROM Mobile WHERE sessionCrashed is null FACET lastInteraction SINCE 90 days ago Copy Example query for crashed sessions: SELECT count(*) FROM Mobile WHERE sessionCrashed is true FACET lastInteraction SINCE 90 days ago Copy",

      "body": "Application Monitoring Tips You Need To Know It's one thing to know how to use APM, but it's another thing to know how to use New Relic's application performance monitoring software well. Here are some best practices designed to help you become an APM master—and a key asset to your team! Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. 1. Standardize application names Most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as \"My Application\" or \"PHP Application,\" if you don't specify one in your New Relic configuration file. You don't want to end up with 20 identically named applications, be sure to select a descriptive identifier for your apps as soon you deploy them. To keep things consistent and easy to navigate, New Relic recommends standardizing your application naming (for example, all apps in Staging append [ Staging] or the like at the end of their names). Ideally, you want your new Java applications to be named automatically to reduce the chances of typographical errors and misnaming. How to do it For Java applications, automatic application naming can come from the following sources: Request attribute Servlet init parameter Filter init parameter Web app context parameter Web app context name (display name) Web app context path Choose the method that fits best your needs and follow these steps. For non-Java applications, there are no automatic naming methods, so refer to the documentation for your APM agent. 2. Add tags to your applications When several different applications use the same account, and each application spans multiple environments (for example, development, test, pre-production, production), it can be hard to find a specific application in your overview dashboard. That's why we recommend adding tags to your apps so that you can segment them into logical groups. The two most common tags that mature APM customers use are application name and environment. So, for example, if you wanted to view the billing application in Test, you could simply filter by \"billing app\" (name tag) and \"test\" (environment tag). Caution In the APM agent configuration settings files, use the labels field to add tags to your data. For example, see this description of the Python labels setting. APM is designed so that apps can roll up into an unlimited number of meaningful tag categories. How to do it Learn about tags. Learn how to add tags.. Learn how to query tags. 3. Create and evaluate alert policies When key performance indicators spike or drop, individuals and teams in your organization need to be notified. Alerting in New Relic provides a set of tools including dynamic baselines that allow you to detect problems before they impact your end users. Alert policies can be set up in two primary ways: Static threshold alerts are great when you already know the nature of an application and its normal behaviors aren't likely to change anytime soon. Apdex score, response time, error rate, throughput are some of the static thresholds you can create alert policies on. Dynamic baseline alerts make it easy to determine and set dynamic alert thresholds for applications with varying seasonal patterns and growth trends (which make it difficult to set thresholds that define normal behavior). These alerts use baselines modeled from your application’s historical metric data. Each alert policy can contain as many conditions as you need, and each alert condition includes three components: Type of condition (metric, external service, and so on) Entities that the policy targets (for example, APM apps, browser monitoring apps, or hosts) Thresholds that escalate into alerting situations with increasing severity Once you have your alerting set up, you then want to make sure you're taking advantage of all viable notification channels. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can manage alerts by creating specific user groups and by leveraging New Relic's integrated alert channels, including Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks, and email. Be sure to evaluate alert policies on a regular basis to ensure that they are always valid. How to do it See the detailed documentation: To set up dynamic baseline alerts and choose an application, follow standard procedures. You will see a preview of the metric with the predicted baseline You can select a metric for that application and see the corresponding baseline. Then, using the threshold sliders, you can set how closely you want your threshold to follow the baseline prediction. To set up static threshold alerts for your Apdex settings, follow standard procedures. To set up your alert notification channels, follow standard procedures. 4. Identify and set up key transactions Depending on the nature of your application, some transactions may be more important to you than others. New Relic's key transactions feature is designed to help you closely monitor what you consider to be your app's most business-critical transactions, whether that's end-user or app response time, call counts, error rates, or something else. You can also set alert threshold levels for notifications when your key transactions are performing poorly. How to do it In the menu bar, select More > Key transactions, and then select Add more. Then select the app and web transaction or, from the selected transaction, select Track as key transaction. Type a name for the key transaction, and select Track key transaction. Optional: If the agent for the selected app supports custom alerting, use the default values that New Relic automatically fills, or select Edit key alert transaction policy to set the Apdex and alert threshold values. To view the key transactions dashboard details, select View new key transaction. 5. Track deployment history When development teams are pushing new code out as frequently as possible, it can be hard to measure the impact that each deployment is having on performance. One way to stay in tune with how these changes are affecting your application is with deployment reports. These reports list recent deployments and their impact on end-users and app servers' Apdex scores, along with response times, throughput, and errors. You can also view and drill down into the details to catch errors related to recent deployments, or file a ticket and share details with your team. How to do it From the New Relic menu bar, select APM > (selected app) > Events > Deployments. To view performance after a deployment, go to the selected app's Overview dashboard in the Recent events section. A blue vertical bar on a chart indicates a deployment. To view summary information about the deployment, point to the blue bar. 6. Review APM reports From SLA, deployment, and capacity to scalability, host usage reports, and more, New Relic APM offers a variety of downloadable reporting tools surfacing historical trends—all great ways to report to senior executive teams or customers. Take a look at the full list of reports and use them to your advantage. How to do it From the New Relic APM menu bar, select Applications > (selected app) > Reports. Select the report you'd like to see. If you want to save or export a report to share, select Download this report as .csv, which will create a report with comma-separated values. 7. Review your environment with service maps Use New Relic service maps, a feature included in APM, to understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and talk to each other. Service maps are visual, customizable representations of your application architecture. Maps automatically show you your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. How to do it Go to one.newrelic.com > More > service maps. To get started, read the instructions in Introduction to service maps. 8. Keep current With New Relic’s SaaS platform, getting new features is as easy as updating your agent. Most likely your organization already has a set of scripts for deploying application upgrades into your environment. In a similar fashion, you can also automate your New Relic agent deployment to ensure that your systems are up to date. Both Puppet and Chef scripts are great examples of deployment frameworks that make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. How to do it Regularly review which version of the agent you're using so that you know when an update is needed. If the latest agent release contains a needed fix or added functionality, download it. To deploy the agent automatically (preferred as a method to avoid errors): Use existing deployment scripts, provided they can be adapted to handle the deployment. OR Create and maintain a script that specifically deploys and configures the New Relic agent. Ideally, the script would pull the agent files from a repository where the files are versioned (for rollback purposes). Once the script has been created, shut down the application (unless script handles this). Run the deployment script. Start the application (unless script handles this). If problems arise, run the script to roll back to the previous version. To deploy the agent manually: Back up the current agent directory. Deploy the updated agent into the existing agent directory. Modify configuration files by comparing new files with existing files. In particular, make sure things like license key and custom extensions are copied over to the new configuration. Restart the application. If problems arise, restore the old agent using the backup and restart. 9. Manage user access Important This is available only for accounts on our original product-based pricing plan. Enable role-based access control (RBAC) and single sign-on (SSO) New Relic allows authorized individuals to access the broadest possible amount of data, regardless of their assigned role. As an Owner or Administrator of your New Relic account, you can control the permissions of individual users or entire roles with RBAC. To find out what is possible and how to make changes, see Users and roles. Security is no doubt of utmost concern to your organization. To simplify password management for your employees and strengthen security, you may already be using SSO with your other systems. You should do the same with New Relic. Using New Relic's SSO integration feature, account administrators will be able to enforce strong passwords and restrict login via a corporate authentication mechanism. This way, New Relic users who have already authenticated using a corporate SSO system will be able to bypass the New Relic login prompt. How to do it Log in to New Relic as an admin and go to the SSO configuration page. From the New Relic title bar, select (your account name) > Account Settings > Integrations > Single Sign On. From the SAML Single Sign On page, review your New Relic SAML Service Provider details. To upload your SAML Identity Provider certificate, select Choose File, and then follow standard procedures to select and save the file. Copy and paste in (or type) the Remove login URL that your users will use for Single Sign-On. If your organization’s SAML integration provides a redirect URL for logout, copy and paste in (or type) the Logout landing URL; otherwise leave blank. Save, test, and enable.",

Here are some best practices to take full advantage of mobile monitoring with New Relic. 1. Start collecting data Start collecting data in production. You'll see immediate value by adding our mobile monitoring SDK to your app for its next release to the app store. We recommend installing the iOS or Android agent to your production release even if you're simply testing New Relic's capabilities. This will ensure you'll get an adequate amount of data to really understand all of our mobile monitoring capabilities and your end users' experience. How to do it Add your mobile app to New Relic First, add a new app in New Relic's user interface (full steps): Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. From the list of monitored apps, select Add more. Select the relevant platform. Type a name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Use one app and the associated app token for the development releases of your iOS app, another app and its associated app token for the production releases of that iOS app, and another pair of app tokens for development and production releases of your Android app. You'll be able to compare data from across the four app tokens using our query builder. Install and configure our mobile SDK Next, install and configure the mobile agent: Download the latest version of New Relic's SDK for iOS or Android, and add it to your mobile app. (Full steps for iOS and Android) Configure your installation as needed. For example: Enable the feature flag to capture MobileRequest events to use our full network analysis capabilities for iOS or Android. Automate dSYM uploads for your production builds. To avoid surprises, follow the standard pattern of where you start our mobile agent. In addition, start our agent before you initiate any other SDKs. For more information, see our documentation for Android installation and configuration and for iOS installation and configuration. Deploy a new release of your application. 2. Explore your data Immediately be able to explore your data. As soon as New Relic starts reporting data, take the time to explore the wealth of information about your mobile apps. To get started, go to one.newrelic.com and select Mobile. How to do it Analyze, resolve, and prevent crashes Find the cause of crashes so you can fix them. Then, uncover trends behind crashes so you can prevent them: From the summary UI page for a monitored mobile app, click Crash analysis. Analyze crash data so you can see and fix the most impactful crashes. Follow the breadcrumbs in the crash event trail to fix crashes and resolve critical errors more easily: From your mobile app's Crash analysis page in the UI, select a Crash type. From the crash type's Summary page, select the Crash trail tab. For more information, see our blog post about crash analysis. Monitor your key workflows Create custom breadcrumbs to monitor key workflows (such as your app's login or checkout process), track user clicks, optimize timing, and identify crash locations for faster MTTR. Get actionable session data Borrow from our example queries to: See how much of your user base has upgraded to your latest app version. Track adoption over time. Get a count of new installs as compared to upgrades from an earlier version. See the distribution of usage across geographical locations, carriers, ASN owners (wi-fi providers), devices, connection types, and more. 3. Take preventive steps Use alert notifications to help uncover the causes behind crashes and errors. Once you are running our mobile monitoring capabilities in production and have explored some of the key features, you can use New Relic to uncover critical issues with your mobile application. In particular, focus on crashes and errors. Use metric-based alerts as a starting point to gain high-level visibility into problems. Then, as new services or functionalities are added, use New Relic’s more targeted, event-based (NRQL) alerts to make sure that the most critical issues are handled swiftly. Use these alerts to determine whether a crash is impacting a large number of users. If it is, the relevant people (for example, both the mobile app team’s on-call member and the owner of the related back-end service) will be alerted. Make sure that your team knows how to respond to changes in crash rate (crashes per sessions) and the percentage of users impacted by crashes of your mobile app. How to do it Metric-based alerts Use our metric-based alerts and mobile monitoring UI: Ensure that key members of your mobile team have opted in to receive emails for new crashes. These emails will take you to the crash type in the UI page for your mobile app. Create an alert for your crash rate threshold that key members of your team can view in Slack or any other Alerts notification channel you choose. Your alert notification will include a link to our UI, where you can examine a chart with the exceeded threshold. From there, a link will take you to the relevant mobile monitoring page, where you can get additional details. Event-based alerts Combine the metric-based workflow with event-based alerts and dashboards specific to your mobile app and system. Create your NRQL alert that focuses on crashes of your most recently released production version. Create an additional NRQL alert that focuses on the percentage of users impacted by crashes in your latest app version (to check the overall impact on your user base). 4. Dig deeper into crashes Take your crash reporting to the next level. Now it’s time to tackle some of those harder-to-reproduce crashes by: Applying additional instrumentation to your application. Leveraging crash event trails, NRQL queries, and dashboards to visualize your data. How to do it Crash analysis Crashes are an inevitable part of running mobile applications at scale. We provide tools to help you understand your highest-impact crashes. Use the Crash analysis UI to see which crashes are occurring most often, the percentage of crash-free users, which files and methods are associated with perhaps 80 percent of your crashes, which crashes a particular user just experienced, and more. Go after high-impact crashes with crash analysis: Add custom attributes to categorize the highest-value customers, and then use them to segment crashes according to your most valuable audiences. Add breadcrumbs and custom events to produce a detailed trail of events leading up to every crash occurrence (over the last 90 days). Then, view this crash event trail in our mobile monitoring UI. Use our mobile monitoring's Versions trends page to make sure you’re improving the crash rate over subsequent releases and avoiding regressions. Breadcrumbs Use breadcrumbs and custom attributes to better reproduce and debug crashes. For example, use our recordBreadrumb API for Android or iOS to track mid-session changes in state that can help debug crashes, such as: Change of connection type Change of orientation CPU and memory state at key points in the app code Custom attributes Add custom attributes to existing events, so you can ask even more precise questions of your mobile app. Add dimensions such as: User ID: Use to react to specific user concerns and to better understand which customers and segments are most impacted. Store ID: Use to address problems with out-of-date devices, bad wi-fi, and so on. User segments: Use to better understand which customers and segments are most impacted; for example, logged in vs. non-logged in. Money in the cart at session end Origin or attribution of entry into the app Standardize custom attribute names across your mobile apps, and align with your website (if you're using our browser monitoring), so that you can compare and contrast performance across end-user channels. The mobile agents track the last interaction of crashed and non-crashed sessions to provide visibility into what the user viewed before exiting your app (either intentionally or due to a crash). 5. Focus on KPIs Bring your key performance indicators to life. Create custom interactions and events to hone in on the most important signals, including user activity for the business-critical aspects of your app. Using these powerful APIs, you can add custom instrumentation to just about anything. The following are some example use cases. How to do it Track and query feature use Use custom events to track feature use. For example: Use custom events to track user flow between app and website. Use custom events or mobile breadcrumbs to optimize the performance of key user flows (log in, shopping cart, etc.). use custom events to provide faster, contextualized support experiences for your digital customers. Use the recordCustomEvent API. Then compare the use of different features using: SELECT count(*) FROM MyNewMobileEventType FACET name Copy Measure page load times Use custom events to measure page load time: Create an app-launch timer to measure the time that elapses between a user-tap to launch your app and the point in your app code where the first screen is available. Record the timer value in New Relic using something like the following: recordCustomEvent(<myMobileTimers>, <appLaunch>, {attributes}) Copy Define start and stop timers to measure spinner durations, and then record this time in New Relic using something like the following: recordCustomEvent(<myMobileTimers>, <spinnerOnScreenA>, {attributes}) Copy Track specific user actions or funnel steps in the app (like \"add to cart\"), and include the price as an attribute on that event. Measure flows through the application by viewing the related funnel steps with custom events in Insights. For example, create a timer to track the start and end times of a subflow or an entire flow across multiple funnel steps to understand how long it took users to get through the process. Examine data about webpage interactions Use custom interactions to see traces associated with the same webpages. Use the agent API to disable default interactions, and focus on custom interactions so that you can review the page loads that are most crucial to your primary funnel. Define the start and stop times of these custom interactions to trace activities associated with individual steps of that funnel (for example, a specific user action or a page load). Track the last interactions of crashed and non-crashed sessions so that you can see what the user viewed before exiting your app (either intentionally or from a crash). Example query for non-crashed sessions: SELECT count(*) FROM Mobile WHERE sessionCrashed is null FACET lastInteraction SINCE 90 days ago Copy Example query for crashed sessions: SELECT count(*) FROM Mobile WHERE sessionCrashed is true FACET lastInteraction SINCE 90 days ago Copy",

It also records the userId as a custom parameter on the transaction so that it appears in the parameter details of a transaction trace. (Page load timing sometimes is referred to as real user monitoring or RUM.) String userId = req.getParameter(\"userId\"); if (userId != null) { // set the user name to associate with the RUM JavaScript footer // for the current web transaction NewRelic.setUserName(userId); // add a key/value pair to the current transaction NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"userId\", userId); } Copy Collect promotion data This part of the API call records the number of times a promotion was viewed so that the metrics can appear on a custom dashboard.

      "body": "With the .NET agent, you can add browser monitoring instrumentation to your webpages. Before you use browser with your .NET agent, refer to the .NET agent release notes, and make sure you have the installed the latest .NET agent release. Follow the .NET agent requirements to install browser monitoring. Then follow the procedures in this document to manually instrument the .NET agent. Auto-instrumentation Important This feature is not available for asp.net core applications whether they are monitored by the .NET Framework or Core agent. Browser auto-instrumentation is enabled by default. With browser auto-instrumentation, the .NET Framework agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript header into any page that has a content-type of text/html and also has <head> tag within the page. The <head> tag search starts at the beginning of the DOM. The .NET agent injects the JavaScript header through the addition of an HttpModule that modifies the page using HTTP response filters before streaming the content to the user. The first time you enable auto-instrumentation, you may need to clean your asp.net cache directory so that aspx pages are recompiled. Use the following command: flush_dotnet_temp.cmd Copy With this injection, previously functioning pages may stop working if a content-type is not set correctly. To correct, review and update the content-types in your app or disable auto-instrumentation. Manual instrumentation via agent API If you cannot enable auto-instrumentation, you can still include the browser agent manually by using the New Relic .NET agent API and including appropriate code in your pages. To download the NewRelic.Api.agent.dll, re-run the installation and reference the .dll: From the New Relic .NET agent directory, select the New Relic.Net agent section, then select API Assembly. NuGet: Install and reference the .dll by running Install-package NewRelic.Agent.Api. To set up your web application to call the New Relic .NET agent API, add a reference to NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll to your project. Optional: If you are modifying the deployed application directory on the web server, copy NewRelic.Api.Agent.dll into the application's bin directory. Call the API in your <head> tag. If a meta-tag with the X-UA-COMPATIBLE http-equiv attribute exists, set it after that meta tag. .NET Web Forms view engine When using .NET Web Forms view engine, be sure to use = and not :. That way the view engine will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. If you are using .NET ASP Web Forms with master pages, add the header manually by calling GetBrowserTimingHeader() in your master page under the <head> tag: <%= NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader() %> Copy Import the namespace with: <%@ Import Namespace=\"NewRelic.Api.Agent\" %> Copy Other view engines such as Razor For other view engines such as Razor, you can use the GetBrowserTimingHeader() method to generate the header string. Here is a Razor-based view example: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en\"> <head> @Html.Raw(NewRelic.Api.Agent.NewRelic.GetBrowserTimingHeader()) ... </head> </html> Copy .NET MVC When using .NET MVC, call the Html.Raw helper. That way, .NET MVC will recognize the string of HTML returned from the API as HTML / JavaScript and render it appropriately. Disable instrumentation To disable instrumentation: Disable auto-instrumentation To fully disable auto-instrumentation, edit newrelic.config and set the autoInstrument flag to false: <!-- disable auto instrumentation --> <browserMonitoring autoInstrument=\"false\"/> Copy Important If you change the flag or uninstall the .NET agent, be sure to flush your cache again so that references to the agent are removed from compiled files. Disable auto-instrumentation on a particular view To disable only auto-instrumentation on a particular view, use the agent API call DisableBrowserMonitoring(). Add this call in any view where browser scripts are not needed or wanted. Put this API call as close as possible to the top of the view where you want it disabled. Disable both automatic and manual instrumentation on a particular view To disable both auto-instrumentation and manual instrumentation for individual webpages, use the agent API call DisableBrowserMonitoring(true).

Get started This doc will give you a fairly technical explanation of our core data types, their structure, and how they're used in our features. You can use most of our features without needing to understand the underlying data structure. But having a better understanding of this can help you get data into New Relic, understand the data you see in our UI, and query your data. For a simpler explanation of these data types using real-world examples, see Introduction to essential telemetry data types. Another good way to understand your data is to just start querying it. Tip Access your data easily on one.newrelic.com: Click the Browse data dropdown menu and select the data type (metrics, events, logs, and traces) you want to explore. Metrics First, we’ll explain the definition of metrics from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain how New Relic handles metrics. For a list of the metrics we collect, see our documentation on metrics. Metrics in the monitoring industry In the software monitoring industry, a metric means a numeric measurement of an application or system. Metrics are typically reported on a regular schedule. Two major types of metrics are: Aggregated data. For example: a count of events over one minute’s time, or the rate of some event per minute. A numeric status at a moment in time. For example: a CPU temperature reading, or a “CPU% used” status. Metrics are relatively easy to report and store because a single record can represent a range of time. They can also be aggregated more and more over time. For example, per-minute data may be “rolled up” to per-hour aggregations after some amount of time, and eventually may be rolled up to a per-day aggregation. This approach is efficient for long-term data storage. Metrics are a strong solution for storing data long-term, and understanding trends over time. One potential downside is that it can be difficult to do detailed analysis of older data that has been aggregated over time; when high detail is required about specific important actions, event data can be used. Metrics at New Relic Conceptually, \"metrics\" is a broad, general category. There are various ways New Relic measures and reports metrics but, in practice, when using the New Relic UI, you usually won't have to understand how exactly this happens. In our documentation, we typically will just refer to \"metrics,\" regardless of how that data is reported, unless there's a reason you need to know more (like understanding how to query your data). Here are some of the ways metrics are reported and stored across the New Relic platform: Dimensional metrics (used by Metric API and many integrations) In the monitoring industry, \"dimensional\" metrics refer to metric data that has a variety of attributes (dimensions) attached, such as duration-related attributes (start time, end time), entity ID, region, host, etc. This amount of detail allows for in-depth analysis and querying. At New Relic, this metric data is attached to the Metric data type and is sent from several sources: Some open-source integrations, like our Prometheus and OpenCensus exporters Our Telemetry SDKs Infrastructure services The Metric API (the underlying API used by the above tools) The events-to-metrics service To query this data and see its attributes (\"dimensions\"), you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Metric Copy As time passes, these metrics are increasingly aggregated into larger time buckets. This is done to optimize your ability to query data over a long period of time. For more details about the metric data type, see our docs. To learn how this data is ingested and stored, see the Metric API documentation. For tips on querying, see Metric query examples. Metric timeslice data (used by APM, browser, mobile) New Relic's APM, browser, and mobile report and display metrics in a simple data format that we refer to as metric timeslice data. A metric timeslice consists of three parts: a metric name, the segment of time the metric represents (the \"timeslice\"), and a numeric value (the measurement). For example: an APM metric timeslice for time spent in a particular transaction is named WebTransaction/URI/foo, and might have a response time of 0.793 for a one-minute time slice from 10:20am to 10:21am. These metrics usually follow a pattern like <category>/<class>/<method>. Our agents (APM, browser, and mobile) can collect thousands of metric timeslices per minute for a variety of performance metrics. For example: error rate, bandwidth usage, and garbage collection time. You also have the ability to create custom metrics. Metric timeslice data is a lightweight data type and lacks the detail that dimensional metrics have. Ways to explore and query metric timeslice data: For APM: metric timeslice data is converted to dimensional metrics and can be queried via NRQL Use the REST API If you want to learn more about the structure of metric timeslice data and see some examples, expand the collapser below. Metric timeslice examples Here are some common metric timeslice data examples, with a focus on common ones used by Ruby applications. ActiveMerchant New Relic tracks a variety of metrics on ActiveMerchant transactions which can be used for business analytics as well as performance monitoring. The metrics are summarized by operation as well as by gateway. regex sample metric legend name ActiveMerchant/. * ActiveMerchant/PayJunctionGateway ActiveMerchant/gateway/. * ActiveMerchant/gateway/PayJunctionGateway/purchase PayJunctionGateway ActiveMerchant/operation/. * ActiveMerchant/operation/purchase purchase For more information, see the ActiveMerchant website. ActiveRecord ActiveRecord is the Object-Relational Mapping API used by Ruby on Rails applications. The metrics shown here measure the performance of ActiveRecord's find and save methods. regex sample metric legend name ActiveRecord/. * /find ActiveRecord/User/find User#find ActiveRecord/. * /save ActiveRecord/Product/save Product#save For more information, see the API documentation for ActiveRecord. Apdex Apdex is a measure of user satisfaction with page load times. Controller In Ruby on Rails applications, HTTP requests are handled by Controller actions. A Rails application has many controllers, each of which has one or more actions. When your rails application receives an http request, that request is routed to the appropriate controller and action, based on the URL of that request. That action then does whatever processing is neccesary to generate an http response, which is most often a web page, but could also be a page fragment, an xml document, or any other kind of data that is requested by the client. The following metrics track the performance of controller actions, regardless of routing, and without taking into account any network or web server effects. regex sample metric legend name Controller/. * Controller/Users/show /Users/show Controller/. * /(?! \\ (other \\ )). * Controller/Users/show /Users/show Controller$ Controller All Controller Actions ControllerCPU/ ControllerCPU/Users/Show /Users/show For more information, see the API documentation for ActionController. Errors This metric tracks the number of errors or exceptions raised while processing requests. regex sample metric legend name Errors/all Errors/all External services External service instrumentation captures calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud and any other network calls. It does not include other first class back-end components such as MemCache and the database. In Ruby applications we instrument the Net::Http library to capture all HTTP services. regex sample metric legend name External/ [ ^/]+/all$ External/service.example.com/all All service.example.com calls External/ External/host.aws.com/Net::Http : :POST Net::Http : :POST [ host.aws.com] External/all$ External/all External Services External/ [ ^/]+/(?!all)/ External/service.example.com/all All service.example.com calls HTTP dispatcher This metric represents a summary of the throughput and response time of all web requests. regex sample metric legend name ^HttpDispatcher$ HttpDispatcher HttpDispatcher MemCache MemCache is a popular technology that enables applications to access shared memory provided by any number of physical machines as a global cache. Applications that heavily use the database often use MemCache for performance and scalability benefits. These metrics measure the frequency and response time of calls to MemCache to read and write data from the cache. Response times should be low (less than 5 ms) for a well performing MemCache deployment. regex sample metric legend name MemCache/. * MemCache/read MemCache read operations MemCache/read MemCache/read MemCache read operations MemCache/write MemCache/write MemCache write operations Mongrel This metric measures the length of the mongrel queue, which holds pending http requests to be processed by mongrel. The HTTP Activity graph overlays the maximimum queue length for a given period. The value is zero if mongrel is processing a request but has no other requests waiting in its queue. When looking at this value across an aggregate cluster of mongrels, the queue lengths of all mongrels is added together, showing the sum of all queue lengths. A mongrel queue length should be at or near zero; if it is consistently at a higher level, then it indicates that your rails application is having trouble keeping up with its load requirements. regex sample metric legend name Mongrel/Queue Length Mongrel/Queue Length Queue Length View ActionView is a package in Rails that is used to render the output that is the response to an http request, such as an html page or an xml document. The View is rendered by the controller that is handling the request. If View metrics represent a large portion of your controller's response time, it could mean you are doing a lot of database operations inside the view template itself. regex sample metric legend name View/. * View/Users/ _ child.html.erb/Partial Users/ _ child.html.erb View/. * /Partial View/Users/ _ child.html.erb/Partial Users/ _ child.html.erb View/. * /Rendering View/Users/show.html.erb/Rendering Users/show.html.erb For more information, see the API documentation for ActionView. Metrics attached to events (used by Infrastructure, other products) Because event-type data can have any type of key-value pair data attached to it, one way metrics can be reported is as attributes attached to an event. A couple examples of this at New Relic: Our infrastructure monitoring reports many metrics that are attached to events. For example, we report a ProcessSample event, which has various sample-based metrics attached to it, like CPU percentage. To learn more about infrastructure monitoring data, see Infrastructure data. In APM, the Transaction event has several metrics attached to it, including databaseDuration. To learn more about this data and how to query it, see Events. Metrics as a computation of events (used in some charts and queries) Metrics can be formed by counting New Relic events, or doing some other mathematical calculation on those events. For example, if you wanted to measure the total number of Transaction events over the last half hour, you might run this NRQL query: Select count(*) from Transaction since 30 minutes ago Copy Another example: if you wanted to compute the average response time for your service, you might run a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) SINCE 30 minutes ago Copy Some New Relic charts are generated with these kinds of queries. The downside of this approach is that there are limits on how many events a monitoring system (including ours) can report. This means that sometimes, for high-throughput systems, the count may not accurately represent the total activity on that system. To learn more about how this can be addressed, see Event limits and sampling. Want to report custom metrics? See Get data into New Relic. Event data First, we’ll explain the definition of events from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain some specifics about how New Relic handles event data. Events in the monitoring industry In the software industry, events can be thought of as simply “things that occur in a system.” For example, a server setting being changed would be an event. Another example: a website user clicking a mouse. Some events will generate a stored record, and that record is typically also called an event. Event data represents discrete occurrences and typically will have a high level of detail, so event data is suited for detailed analysis and querying. The downside to the use of event data is that there are typically so many events reported that it can become difficult to query that large dataset over longer time ranges. Events at New Relic At New Relic, we report events to data objects also called events. These events have multiple attributes (key-value pairs) attached. Event data is used in some UI charts and tables, and you can also query it. How long event data remains available is determined by data retention rules. One example of an event: APM reports an event type named Transaction, which represents a logical unit of work in an application. To see the attributes attached to this event, you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Transaction Copy For examples of querying event data, see Introduction to NRQL. Other details about New Relic event data: Events can have any type of attributes attached. Some events have attributes that report metric data. You can report custom events. To increase the availability of your event data for querying/charting, you can turn events into metrics. Some systems generate a large number of events that exceeds collection limits and results in incomplete query results. For more on this, see Event sampling. Because event is a general term, in some New Relic contexts it will refer to any data type that can be queried via NRQL. For example, when you run a NRQL query, it returns a count of inspected events: this is a count of all data types queried. Log data First, we’ll explain the definition of logs from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain some specifics about how New Relic handles log reporting. Logs in the monitoring industry A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. Logs at New Relic New Relic's Logs gives you a centralized log management platform that connects your log data with other New Relic-monitored data. For example, you can see logs alongside your APM data. In New Relic, log data is reported with multiple attributes (key-value data) attached. To query your log data, you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Log Copy To report custom log data, see the Log API. Trace data First, we’ll explain the definition of traces from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain some specifics about how New Relic handles tracing. Tracing in the monitoring industry In the application/infrastructure-monitoring world, tracing is a general term used to refer to various ways to report information about how a program or system is operating. For example, a stack trace provides in-depth information about a program’s subroutines. For large modern systems, which are often distributed across many services and micro-services, “tracing” often refers to distributed tracing, which is a way to monitor requests as they propagate through a complex, distributed environment. Tracing at New Relic New Relic offers a distributed tracing feature that tracks requests across a distributed system, and provides a dedicated UI for understanding and analyzing your traces. In New Relic, trace data is reported as Span objects, with multiple attributes (key-value pairs) attached. To query your tracing data, you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Span Copy To learn more about how distributed tracing works, see Understand distributed tracing. To report custom distributed tracing data, see the Trace API.

      "body": "Use Infrastructure monitoring's Host not reporting condition to notify you when we've stopped receiving data from an infrastructure agent. This feature allows you to dynamically alert on groups of hosts, configure the time window from five to 60 minutes, and take full advantage of alerts notifications. Features You can define conditions based on the sets of hosts most important to you, and configure thresholds appropriate for each filter set. The Host not reporting event triggers when data from the infrastructure agent doesn't reach our collector within the time frame you specify. Caution If you have filtered your Host Not Reporting condition using tags or labels and then remove a critical tag or label from a targeted host, the system will open a Host Not Reporting violation, since it will characterize that host as having lost its connection. This feature's flexibility allows you to easily customize what to monitor and when to notify selected individuals or teams. In addition, the email notification includes links to help you quickly troubleshoot the situation. Host not reporting condition Features What to monitor You can use filter sets to select which hosts you want to be monitored with the alert condition. The condition will also automatically apply to any hosts you add in the future that match these filters. How to notify Conditions are contained in policies. You can select an existing policy or create a new policy with email notifications from the Infrastructure monitoring UI. If you want to create a new policy with other types of notification channels, use the UI. When to notify Email addresses (identified in the policy) will be notified automatically about threshold violations for any host matching the filters you have applied, depending on the policy's incident preferences. Where to troubleshoot The link at the top of the email notification will take you to the infrastructure Events page centered on the time when the host disconnected. Additional links in the email will take you to additional detail. Create \"host not reporting\" condition To define the Host not reporting condition criteria: Follow standard procedures to create an infrastructure condition. Select Host not reporting as the Alert type. Define the Critical threshold for triggering the notification: minimum 5 minutes, maximum 60 minutes. Enable 'Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown' option, if you want to prevent false alerts when you have hosts set to shut down via command line. Currently this feature is supported on all Windows systems and Linux systems using systemd. Depending on the policy's incident preferences, it will define which notification channels to use when the defined Critical threshold for the condition passes. To avoid \"false positives,\" the host must stop reporting for the entire time period before a violation is opened. Example: You create a condition to open a violation when any of the filtered set of hosts stop reporting data for seven minutes. If any host stops reporting for five minutes, then resumes reporting, the condition does not open a violation. If any host stops reporting for seven minutes, even if the others are fine, the condition does open a violation. Investigate the problem To further investigate why a host is not reporting data: Review the details in the email notification. Use the link from the email notification to monitor ongoing changes in your environment from Infrastructure monitoring's Events page. For example, use the Events page to help determine if a host disconnected right after a root user made a configuration change to the host. Optional: Use the email notification's Acknowledge link to verify you are aware of and taking ownership of the alerting incident. Use the email links to examine additional details in the Incident details page. Intentional outages We can distinguish between unexpected situations and planned situations with the option Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown. Use this option for situations such as: Host has been taken offline intentionally. Host has planned downtime for maintenance. Host has been shut down or decommissioned. Autoscaling hosts or shutting down instances in a cloud console. We rely on Linux and Windows shutdown signals to flag a clean shutdown. We've confirmed that these scenarios are detected by the agent: AWS Auto-scaling event with EC2 instances that use systemd (Amazon Linux, CentOs/RedHat 7 and newer, Ubuntu 16 and newer, Suse 12 and newer, Debian 9 and newer) User-initiated shutdown of Windows systems User-initiated shutdown of Linux systems that use systemd (Amazon Linux, CentOs/RedHat 7 and newer, Ubuntu 16 and newer, Suse 12 and newer, Debian 9 and newer) We know that these scenarios are not detected by the agent: User-initiated shutdown of Linux systems that don't use systemd (CentOs/RedHat 6 and earlier, Ubuntu 14, Debian 8). This includes other modern Linux systems that still use Upstart or SysV init systems.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

It also forwards data from infrastructure integrations to New Relic, as well as log data for log analytics. There are multiple ways to install and deploy the infrastructure monitoring agent, depending on your setup and needs. This document describes how the infrastructure monitoring agent works and how to install it. Tip To use infrastructure monitoring and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Quick start: Use our guided install The quickest way to get started with our infrastructure monitoring agent is through our guided install. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install not only installs the infrastructure agent, but also discovers the applications and log sources running in your environment. It recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your infrastructure. Important If you install the agent using the New Relic One UI, the Infrastructure status API is enabled by default. One agent, many capabilities Our infrastructure monitoring agent collects performance and health data about the system resources and processes of the host where it's enabled (on-premises or virtualized). At the same time, it acts as a forwarder for two types of data: core services metrics, which are collected by on-host integrations, and logs. If you want to collect data about core services running on your host, you need to install the infrastructure monitoring agent first, and then install or enable on-host integrations. Our infrastructure monitoring agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services. It can also forward logs to New Relic. Backend application metrics (APM) are collected by separate language agents. Notice how each integration and forwarder feed different data types in the New Relic database (NRDB). Install the infrastructure monitoring agent If our guided install doesn't work for your setup, follow the instructions for your Linux, Windows, or other setup. The infrastructure monitoring agent can currently run on many Linux distributions, as well as Windows Server. For more information on where you can run the agent, check the compatibility and requirements page. Linux The preferred way to install the Linux agent is through the package manager of your distribution. Select your distribution from the list for step-by-step instructions. Amazon Linux CentOS Container (Docker) Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Other Linux distros To use these installation links, you must be logged to your New Relic account. If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or if you prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced install needs, you can deploy the agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual mode. Windows Server and 10 To deploy the agent on a Windows Server host, install it using our MSI installer. For a guided procedure, click the button below and follow the step-by-step instructions: Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced installation needs, you can deploy the agent using our zip files in assisted or manual mode. Other installation scenarios The infrastructure monitoring agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Check the source code The infrastructure monitoring agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README. What's next After you've installed the infrastructure monitoring agent: Learn how to configure the agent or edit the config template. Install on-host integrations (for example, for Apache or MySQL).

      "body": "Use the infrastructure REST API to add, update, delete, and list alerting conditions. You can also manage individual alerting conditions using the infrastructure monitoring UI. REST API calls for infrastructure alerts are not available in the API Explorer. Why use the API Examples Consistency Define the same set of conditions for every cluster without having to set up identical conditions in the Infrastructure monitoring UI each time. Manage multiple conditions quickly, without having to update them one by one using the UI. Flexibility Create conditions for an arbitrary group of hosts. Disable or delete conditions for hosts taken offline anytime. Create a condition with exclusionary filtering (for instance, environment NOT LIKE x). For more on this, see this post on exclusion filtering. For AWS Cloud integrations, select attributes that haven't been sent up by AWS yet. Create compound alert conditions by using the where_clause, which allows you to specify the limits on a secondary or tertiary metric. Exceed the 500-facet limitation on NRQL alert conditions. Reliability Audit when a condition was last updated. Requirements In order to use the Infrastructure REST API, you need: An API key The alerting condition's related policy_id from New Relic, available via GET list of conditions or via the Alerts REST API The condition id, available via GET list of conditions, or via the condition's URL in the Infrastructure monitoring UI Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, make sure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Using infrastructure API calls Here are some basic cURL commands and their responses for Infrastructure alert conditions. Depending on the type of condition, the DATA information you provide in the call will vary for POST (add) and PUT (update) calls. Definitions of each attribute used in the data blocks can be found in the Definitions section. GET infrastructure conditions You can either GET a list of infrastructure conditions or GET a specific infrastructure condition. Here are a few tips for listing infrastructure conditions. For pagination, use limit (records per page) and offset (how many records to skip) parameters. Default is 50 records per page, and offset starts at 0 (skip no records). To scope the results to a specific policy, use policy_id. Tip If you want to use the GET response as a template for your PUT or POST input, be sure to remove the created_at_epoch_millis, updated_at_epoch_millis and id information. GET a list of infrastructure conditions curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions?policy_id=111111\" Copy Example GET a list of conditions Response showing 2 of the 3 conditions for the example policy (formatted for readability and truncated): HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 622 Content-Type: application/json { \"data\":[ { \"type\":\"infra_process_running\", \"name\":\"Java is running\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(`hostname` LIKE '%cassandra%')\", \"id\":13890, \"created_at_epoch_millis\":1490996713872, \"updated_at_epoch_millis\":1490996713872, \"policy_id\":111111, \"comparison\":\"equal\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":0, \"duration_minutes\":6 }, \"process_where_clause\":\"(`commandName` = 'java')\" }, { \"created_at_epoch_millis\": 1501704525462, \"critical_threshold\": { \"duration_minutes\": 5 }, \"enabled\": true, \"filter\": { \"and\": [ { \"like\": { \"fullHostname\": \"Production_1\" } } ] }, \"id\": 448036, \"name\": \"PROD - Host Machine's Agent Not Responding ....\", \"policy_id\": 98485, \"type\": \"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"updated_at_epoch_millis\": 1504879191220 } . . . ], \"meta\":{ \"limit\":50, \"offset\":0, \"total\":3 }, \"links\":{} } Copy To get a list of the 10 Infrastructure conditions beyond the 50 limit: curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions?policy_id=111111&offset=50&list=10\" Copy GET a specific infrastructure condition To get information about a single Infrastructure condition: curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions/condition-id\" Copy Example GET a specific condition Response (formatted for readability): HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 246 Content-Type: application/json { \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"name\":\"demo condition\", \"enabled\":false, \"id\":13887, \"created_at_epoch_millis\":1490981583580, \"updated_at_epoch_millis\":1490981583580, \"policy_id\":23635, \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":100 } } } Copy Create (POST) an infrastructure condition Important Do not include an \"id\": when adding a new condition (POST). It will be generated when the condition is created. To add an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"data\":{DATA object details}}' Copy Include details in the DATA object (-d \\ section) for the type of infrastructure condition you are adding: Process running conditions API data Metric conditions API data Host not reporting conditions API data Update (PUT) an infrastructure condition You only need to include the fields that need to be changed when updating an infrastructure condition. The API keeps the existing values for any missing fields. Important If you want to change the condition type, do not use PUT. Instead, delete the existing condition, then add (POST) a new condition with the new condition type and all fields. To update an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command. To indicate which condition is to be updated, be sure to include the \"id\": . Example update (PUT) a condition curl -X PUT 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions/condition-id' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"data\":{DATA object details}}' Copy Include details in the DATA object (-d \\ section) for the type of infrastructure condition you are updating: Process running conditions API data Metric conditions API data Host not reporting conditions API data Remove (DELETE) an infrastructure condition To delete an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command: curl -v -X DELETE --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions/condition_id\" Copy Types of conditions Process running conditions API data A process running condition alerts you when the number of processes is above, below, or equal to the threshold you define. To add (POST) or update (PUT) a process running condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. Example condition types For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_process_running\", \"name\":\"Java is running\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"comparison\":\"equal\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":0, \"duration_minutes\":6 }, \"process_where_clause\":\"(commandName = '\\''java'\\'')\" } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause and process_where_clause Metric conditions API data A metric condition alerts you when the metric of your choice is above, below, or equal to the threshold you define. This includes: System metrics Process metrics Network metrics Storage metrics Cloud integration metrics To add (POST) or update (PUT) a metric condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. If you are adding or updating a cloud integration alert condition: For the event_type field, enter the event type generated by your selected cloud integration service (for example, ComputeSample for the AWS EC2 integration). If you are setting up an alert condition on a cloud integration service that requires a provider value (for example, AWS RDS uses DatastoreSample with a provider value of RdsDbInstance or RdsDbCluster), you will need to add the \"integration_provider\" field and use the value that is appropriate for the service your alert condition is targeting (for example, \"integration_provider\":\"RdsDbInstance\"). For the select_value field, build the metric name by using the following syntax, where provider is a standard prefix string: provider.metric.aggregation_type Copy metric: Use the metric name as described in the New Relic documentation for your integration. aggregation_type: Use Sum, Average, Minimum, or Maximum. Refer to the original documentation by the integration's cloud provider to see which statistic aggregations are available for each metric. Example For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_metric\", \"name\":\"Disk Space Condition\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"event_type\":\"StorageSample\", \"select_value\":\"diskFreePercent\", \"comparison\":\"below\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":10, \"duration_minutes\":1, \"time_function\":\"any\" }, \"warning_threshold\":{ \"value\":30, \"duration_minutes\":2, \"time_function\":\"any\" } } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause Host not reporting condition A host not reporting condition alerts you when a host stops reporting. To add (POST) or update (PUT) a host not reporting condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. Example For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"name\":\"Cassandra Host Reporting Condition\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":12 } } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause Definitions When formatting your cURL commands, use these values as needed. These are listed in alphabetical order, not the order they appear in your API calls. Field Definition comparison (enum) Condition type: infra_metric, infra_process_running The value used to define the threshold; for example, \"[\"above\", \"below\", \"equal\"]. critical_threshold and warning_threshold Condition type: all This object identifies the threshold value before opening a violation. The critical_threshold is required. The warning_threshold is optional and may only be used with infra_metric conditions. The keys of this object depend on the condition type.

This automatically populates for infrastructure integrations; for example, StorageSample or SystemSample. filter (string) Condition type: all If the condition was made in the UI, filter appears instead of where_clause; for example: {and: [{is: {ec2InstanceType: \"m3.medium\"}}]} Copy Recommendation: Use where_clause when creating a new condition. id (integer) Condition type: all The condition ID located in the URL. GET: This value appears in the GET response. PUT: Include this value in the DATA section. POST: Do not include this in the DATA section. DELETE: Include this value in the -X DELETE call. integration_provider (string) Condition type: infra_metric For alerts on integrations, use integration_provider instead of event_type. To see valid values: From the New Relic documentation for your cloud service, check the Find and use data section. Example: In the AWS RDS monitoring integration documentation, you can see that the DatastoreSample event type can be used with an integration_provider value of either RdsDbInstance for DB instances, or RdsDbCluster for Aurora DB clusters. name (string) Condition type: all The infrastructure alerting condition's name; for example: \"[test] process running\" Copy policy_id (integer) Condition type: all The unique ID for the alert policy's account ID associated with the condition; for example, 1234567890. This is not the policy's global ID. process_where_clause (string) Condition type: infra_process_running Any filters applied to processes, specifically in process running alert conditions. This parameter is mandatory for those types of alert conditions. For example: \"commandName = '\\''java'\\''\" Copy runbook_url (string) Condition type: all The runbook URL to display in notifications. select_value (string) Condition type: infra_metric The attribute name to identify the metric being targeted; for example, \"cpuPercent\", \"diskFreePercent\", \"memoryResidentSizeBytes\", or \"memoryFreeBytes/memoryTotalBytes*100\". This automatically populates for Infrastructure Integrations; for example, diskFreePercent. type (enum) Condition type: all The type of infrastructure alert condition: \"infra_process_running\", \"infra_metric\", or \"infra_host_not_reporting\". violation_close_timer (integer) Condition type: all The Violation time limit setting, expressed as hours. Possible values are 0, 1, 2, 4, 8,12, 24, 48, 72. This determines how much time will pass before a violation is automatically closed. Setting the time limit to 0 prevents a violation from being force-closed. For new conditions, if a value is not provided, the following default values are used: Host Not Responding (HNR) conditions: 0 (disabled) All other conditions: 24 When updating existing conditions, if a value is provided, it overrides the existing value, but does not affect already opened violations. where_clause (string) Condition type: all If applicable, this identifies any infrastructure host filters used; for example: \"(`hostname` LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", Copy",

      "body": "Use New Relic infrastructure's Process running alert condition to be notified when a set of processes on your filtered hosts stop running for a configurable number of minutes. This is useful, for example, when: Any of the processes on the hosts stop reporting A process you expected to start on a host (such as a new program) is not actually running This feature's flexibility allows you to easily filter what hosts and processes to monitor and when to notify selected individuals or teams. In addition, the email notification includes links to help you quickly troubleshoot the situation. Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Examples By applying filters to the hosts and processes that are important to your business, you can define alerting thresholds to decide when violations open and New Relic sends an email notification to you depending on the policy's incident preferences. These examples illustrate how to use infrastructure monitoring's Process running condition to monitor your processes. Ensure enough processes are running to satisfy load Problem: Some load balancers and application servers work by running many worker processes in parallel. Here, for example, you may want an alert violation when fewer than eight processes are running for a service like gunicorn. Solution: Depending on the situation, use any of these Process running thresholds options as needed: More than the defined number of processes are running Exactly the defined number of processes are running Fewer than the defined number of processes are running Ensure that critical services run constantly Problem: A service, such as a database or application server, is expected to be running constantly on certain hosts, and you need to know when it has stopped. Solution: Use the No processes are running (default) threshold. Monitor startup for critical processes that require special attention Problem: You have processes requiring special attention due to security or potential performance impact. Solution: Use the At least one process is running threshold with condition filters set to a username and specific executable so that New Relic can open a violation when the process is running. Make sure a job doesn't take too long Problem: You have a job that runs periodically, and you want to open a violation when it has been running longer than an expected number of minutes. Solution: Use the At least one process is running threshold. Validate that services started successfully Problem: When provisioning new hosts, you want to open a violation if a required service fails to successfully start up. Solution: Use the No processes are running (default) threshold. Watch for runaway processes or configuration problems Problem: Sometimes problems with processes can be solved with changes to your configuration. For example, you have more than one Chef process running, and you may need to address an issue with how that service is configured. Solution: Depending on the situation, use any of these Process running thresholds options as needed: More than the defined number of processes are running Exactly the defined number of processes are running Fewer than the defined number of processes are running Create an infrastructure process running condition To define the Process running alert criteria: Follow standard procedures to create an infrastructure alert condition. Select Process running as the Alert type. Filter what hosts and processes you want the alert condition to apply to. Define the Critical threshold for triggering the alert notification: minimum 1 minute, default 5 minutes, maximum 60 minutes. If you create the alert condition directly with infrastructure monitoring, New Relic will send an email notification when the defined threshold for the alert condition passes depending on the policy's incident preferences. Your alert policy defines which personnel or teams and which notification channels we use.",

It also forwards data from infrastructure integrations to New Relic, as well as log data for log analytics. There are multiple ways to install and deploy the infrastructure monitoring agent, depending on your setup and needs. This document describes how the infrastructure monitoring agent works and how to install it. Tip To use infrastructure monitoring and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Quick start: Use our guided install The quickest way to get started with our infrastructure monitoring agent is through our guided install. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install not only installs the infrastructure agent, but also discovers the applications and log sources running in your environment. It recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your infrastructure. Important If you install the agent using the New Relic One UI, the Infrastructure status API is enabled by default. One agent, many capabilities Our infrastructure monitoring agent collects performance and health data about the system resources and processes of the host where it's enabled (on-premises or virtualized). At the same time, it acts as a forwarder for two types of data: core services metrics, which are collected by on-host integrations, and logs. If you want to collect data about core services running on your host, you need to install the infrastructure monitoring agent first, and then install or enable on-host integrations. Our infrastructure monitoring agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services. It can also forward logs to New Relic. Backend application metrics (APM) are collected by separate language agents. Notice how each integration and forwarder feed different data types in the New Relic database (NRDB). Install the infrastructure monitoring agent If our guided install doesn't work for your setup, follow the instructions for your Linux, Windows, or other setup. The infrastructure monitoring agent can currently run on many Linux distributions, as well as Windows Server. For more information on where you can run the agent, check the compatibility and requirements page. Linux The preferred way to install the Linux agent is through the package manager of your distribution. Select your distribution from the list for step-by-step instructions. Amazon Linux CentOS Container (Docker) Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Other Linux distros To use these installation links, you must be logged to your New Relic account. If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or if you prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced install needs, you can deploy the agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual mode. Windows Server and 10 To deploy the agent on a Windows Server host, install it using our MSI installer. For a guided procedure, click the button below and follow the step-by-step instructions: Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced installation needs, you can deploy the agent using our zip files in assisted or manual mode. Other installation scenarios The infrastructure monitoring agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Check the source code The infrastructure monitoring agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README. What's next After you've installed the infrastructure monitoring agent: Learn how to configure the agent or edit the config template. Install on-host integrations (for example, for Apache or MySQL).

This document provides examples and reference information for our API endpoints. For developer-focused content on how to use and customize New Relic, see developer.newrelic.com. Tip To use APIs and SDKs, as well as the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. NerdGraph (GraphQL) NerdGraph is New Relic's GraphQL-format API, an efficient and flexible query language that lets you request exactly the data you need, without over-fetching or under-fetching. NerdGraph is the preferred API for querying New Relic data and making a range of feature configurations. To get started, see Introduction to NerdGraph. REST APIs by capability New Relic capabilities, like APM, infrastructure monitoring, or alerts, are often used together, and sometimes they overlap in functionality. This is why multiple APIs may be relevant to each area. Some API functionality will depend on your access to features and data. Tip To learn more about different API key types, see Understand New Relic API keys. Alerts Use the REST API for alerts and the API Explorer to: Create and manage policies, conditions, and notification channels. Create alert conditions based on NRQL queries. Create alert conditions based on data from other New Relic capabilities. APM API resources for application monitoring include: Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Retrieve APM data, including metrics, Apdex, error rates, and host data. Report deployments. Change the app name in the UI. Agent APIs Every APM language agent has an API that lets you customize the agent's default behavior, including reporting custom data. APM agent APIs include: C SDK API Go agent API Java agent API .NET agent API Node.js agent API PHP agent API Python agent API Ruby agent API Query API To query APM data, use the Query API. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Browser monitoring The browser API resources include: Resource Details Browser agent API Use the browser agent API for tasks such as: Report custom end user data to browser monitoring. Monitor asynchronous browser activity using SPA API calls. Insert custom data into New Relic dashboards . Manage source maps. REST API With the REST API you can: Retrieve page load timing data and throughput. Add or list apps monitored by browser monitoring. Manage alerts conditions for your browser data. Query API To retrieve browser monitoring data, use the Query API. Account management APIs For APIs related to accounts and subscription usage, see the account-related APIs. Infrastructure monitoring The Infrastructure API resources include: Resource Details Query API To retrieve infrastructure data, use the Query API. This API can also be used to retrieve subscription usage data. Infrastructure alert API To manage your infrastructure alerts, use the Infrastructure alert API. Integrations SDK To make your own custom integrations for reporting data to infrastructure monitoring, use the Integrations SDK. NerdGraph You can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to query your cloud integration data and make changes to cloud integration settings. Mobile monitoring Mobile API resources include: Resource Details Mobile agent APIs Mobile APIs let you custom instrument your own code and send events to New Relic. See the platform-specific documentation: iOS Android Unity REST API Use the REST API for such tasks as: Retrieve a list of monitored apps. Get subscription usage data. Get metric names and data. Get crash count and crash rate data. Manage New Relic alerts conditions for your mobile apps. Query API To retrieve mobile monitoring data from New Relic, use the Query API. Account management APIs For account-related APIs, see Account APIs. Synthetic monitoring Synthetics API resources include: Resource Details Synthetics REST API The Synthetics REST API functionality includes: Create and manage synthetics monitors. Manage synthetics alert notifications. Add labels to monitors, and retrieve monitors with specific labels. Query API To retrieve synthetics event data, use the Query API. Alerts API To create and manage alert conditions that target synthetics monitors, use the Alerts API. Telemetry APIs for core data types We offer several APIs that allow you to get our core data types (metrics, logs, traces, and events) into New Relic without the use of an installed agent. Data type Description Trace API Send distributed tracing data to New Relic. Event API Send event data to New Relic. Metric API Send metrics to New Relic from any source (including other telemetry monitoring services). Log API Send your log data to New Relic. Account management, admin, and usage APIs Like any other New Relic product or service, you want to be confident that your APIs protect you and your customers' data privacy. The following are API resources related to New Relic account administration and usage. For more information about API capabilities, see the specific New Relic API. For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our security and privacy documentation, or visit the New Relic security website. Resource Details REST API REST API features include: Find your API keys, account ID, and information needed to use the REST API. Return a list of account users (original user model only). Get SLA report data for browser and application monitoring. Subscription usage You can use the Query API to retrieve subscription usage data. This can be helpful to see how usage compares to your current subscription level, or for doing departmental chargebacks. Partner API To retrieve information about your New Relic partner account, sub-accounts, and users, use the Partner API. Other APIs Insights New Relic Insights was the name of our original product that governed custom event reporting and querying. The features associated with Insights have been rolled into our New Relic One platform (learn more), but there are still some APIs and original pricing plans that use the term \"Insights\" for these historical reasons. Insights-related APIs include: Resource Details Event API To report custom events, use the Event API. Query API To query your data using NRQL-format queries, you can use the Query API. Note that this API is deprecated and NerdGraph is preferred for querying your data. Dashboard API See the Insights Dashboard API. Plugins Use the REST API for New Relic plugins and the API Explorer to: Get a list of plugins, including their names, IDs, and GUIDs. List one or more plugin components, their output, and their metric timeslice data. Developers and New Relic partners can also use New Relic's Plugin API to write an agent in any language that can work directly with the API for plugins. This allows you to send your own metric data to our plugins and view data received from the API in New Relic.

      "body": "Our Node.js agent is publicly available on the Node Package Manager (npm) repository as well as on GitHub. Before you install the Node.js agent, make sure your application meets the following system requirements. Node.js version support Tip For best performance, use the latest active long term support (LTS) version of Node.js. Support for new Node.js releases We will support the latest even versions of Node.js releases by the beginning of the following active long term support schedule. The version support policy does not replace the general agent and plugin end-of-life (EOL) policy. The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Node.js version Active long term support (LTS) start date Initial release date of Node.js agent with support 16 October 2021 April-October 2021 End of support for Node.js releases reaching EOL When support for a new long term support agent version is made available, support for the Node.js agent version that reaches end-of-life during the same time period will simultaneously drop. The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary. Node.js version End of life (EOL) date Initial release date of Node.js agent dropping support 12 April 2022 April-October 2022 10 April 2021 As of July 31, 2021, we're discontinuing support for Node.js 10. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. Node.js 12 errors For Node.js 12, the following change affects the Node.js agent: Errors resulting in unhandled rejections are not scoped to the transaction that was active when the rejected promise was created. This is because the promise responsible for triggering the init async hook is no longer passed through on the promise wrap instance. This breaks the linkage that associates a given promise rejection with the transaction it was scheduled in. Supported Node.js frameworks Express 4.6.0 or higher Restify Connect v1 and v2 (router not supported) Hapi Koa 2.0.0 or higher (external module loaded with the agent) If you are using a supported framework with default routers, the Node.js agent can read these frameworks' route names as-is. However, if you want more specific names than are provided by your framework, you may want to use one or more of the tools New Relic provides with the Node.js transaction naming API. Operating systems Linux SmartOS macOS 10.7 and higher Windows Server 2008 and higher Datastores The Node.js agent monitors the performance of Node.js application calls to these datastores: Cassandra Memcached MongoDB MySQL (via mysql and mysql2 packages) Redis Postgres (including the native and pure JavaScript packages) Instance details We collect instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers. The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your agent version. New Relic's Node.js agent version 1.31.0 or higher supports the following: Database npm module name Minimum module version Minimum agent version PostgreSQL pg 4.0.0 1.31.0 Redis redis 2.0.0 1.31.0 MongoDB mongodb 2.1.0 1.32.0 MySQL mysql 2.4.1 1.32.0 Memcached memcached 1.0.0 1.33.0 To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at support.newrelic.com. Messages queues Message queue instrumentation is only available with the New Relic Node.js agent v2 or higher. Currently supported message queue instrumentation: amqplib For other message queue libraries, use custom instrumentation. Hosting services Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment AWS EC2 Microsoft Azure Heroku Process managers In general, process managers that handle starting, stopping, and restarting of Node.js (like Forever) should be compatible with the Node.js agent. If you are using PM2, the minimum supported version of PM2 is 2.0. Security requirements As a standard security measure for data collection, your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported. Connect the agent to other New Relic features The Node.js agent integrates with other features to give you full-stack observability: Product Integration Browser monitoring The Node.js agent automatically injects the browser monitoring agent when you enable auto-instrumentation. After enabling browser monitoring injection, you can view browser data in the APM Summary page and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see Browser monitoring and the Node.js agent. Infrastructure monitoring When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see APM data in infrastructure monitoring. New Relic dashboards The Node.js agent sends default events and attributes for NRQL queries. You can also record custom events for advanced analysis. Synthetic monitoring Synthetic transaction traces connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.",

This document describes how the infrastructure monitoring agent works and how to install it. Tip To use infrastructure monitoring and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Quick start: Use our guided install The quickest way to get started with our infrastructure monitoring agent is through our guided install. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install not only installs the infrastructure agent, but also discovers the applications and log sources running in your environment. It recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your infrastructure. Important If you install the agent using the New Relic One UI, the Infrastructure status API is enabled by default. One agent, many capabilities Our infrastructure monitoring agent collects performance and health data about the system resources and processes of the host where it's enabled (on-premises or virtualized). At the same time, it acts as a forwarder for two types of data: core services metrics, which are collected by on-host integrations, and logs. If you want to collect data about core services running on your host, you need to install the infrastructure monitoring agent first, and then install or enable on-host integrations. Our infrastructure monitoring agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services. It can also forward logs to New Relic. Backend application metrics (APM) are collected by separate language agents. Notice how each integration and forwarder feed different data types in the New Relic database (NRDB). Install the infrastructure monitoring agent If our guided install doesn't work for your setup, follow the instructions for your Linux, Windows, or other setup. The infrastructure monitoring agent can currently run on many Linux distributions, as well as Windows Server. For more information on where you can run the agent, check the compatibility and requirements page. Linux The preferred way to install the Linux agent is through the package manager of your distribution. Select your distribution from the list for step-by-step instructions. Amazon Linux CentOS Container (Docker) Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Other Linux distros To use these installation links, you must be logged to your New Relic account. If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or if you prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced install needs, you can deploy the agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual mode. Windows Server and 10 To deploy the agent on a Windows Server host, install it using our MSI installer. For a guided procedure, click the button below and follow the step-by-step instructions: Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "Use Infrastructure monitoring's Host not reporting condition to notify you when we've stopped receiving data from an infrastructure agent. This feature allows you to dynamically alert on groups of hosts, configure the time window from five to 60 minutes, and take full advantage of alerts notifications. Features You can define conditions based on the sets of hosts most important to you, and configure thresholds appropriate for each filter set. The Host not reporting event triggers when data from the infrastructure agent doesn't reach our collector within the time frame you specify. Caution If you have filtered your Host Not Reporting condition using tags or labels and then remove a critical tag or label from a targeted host, the system will open a Host Not Reporting violation, since it will characterize that host as having lost its connection. This feature's flexibility allows you to easily customize what to monitor and when to notify selected individuals or teams. In addition, the email notification includes links to help you quickly troubleshoot the situation. Host not reporting condition Features What to monitor You can use filter sets to select which hosts you want to be monitored with the alert condition. The condition will also automatically apply to any hosts you add in the future that match these filters. How to notify Conditions are contained in policies. You can select an existing policy or create a new policy with email notifications from the Infrastructure monitoring UI. If you want to create a new policy with other types of notification channels, use the UI. When to notify Email addresses (identified in the policy) will be notified automatically about threshold violations for any host matching the filters you have applied, depending on the policy's incident preferences. Where to troubleshoot The link at the top of the email notification will take you to the infrastructure Events page centered on the time when the host disconnected. Additional links in the email will take you to additional detail. Create \"host not reporting\" condition To define the Host not reporting condition criteria: Follow standard procedures to create an infrastructure condition. Select Host not reporting as the Alert type. Define the Critical threshold for triggering the notification: minimum 5 minutes, maximum 60 minutes. Enable 'Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown' option, if you want to prevent false alerts when you have hosts set to shut down via command line. Currently this feature is supported on all Windows systems and Linux systems using systemd. Depending on the policy's incident preferences, it will define which notification channels to use when the defined Critical threshold for the condition passes. To avoid \"false positives,\" the host must stop reporting for the entire time period before a violation is opened. Example: You create a condition to open a violation when any of the filtered set of hosts stop reporting data for seven minutes. If any host stops reporting for five minutes, then resumes reporting, the condition does not open a violation. If any host stops reporting for seven minutes, even if the others are fine, the condition does open a violation. Investigate the problem To further investigate why a host is not reporting data: Review the details in the email notification. Use the link from the email notification to monitor ongoing changes in your environment from Infrastructure monitoring's Events page. For example, use the Events page to help determine if a host disconnected right after a root user made a configuration change to the host. Optional: Use the email notification's Acknowledge link to verify you are aware of and taking ownership of the alerting incident. Use the email links to examine additional details in the Incident details page. Intentional outages We can distinguish between unexpected situations and planned situations with the option Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown. Use this option for situations such as: Host has been taken offline intentionally. Host has planned downtime for maintenance. Host has been shut down or decommissioned. Autoscaling hosts or shutting down instances in a cloud console. We rely on Linux and Windows shutdown signals to flag a clean shutdown. We've confirmed that these scenarios are detected by the agent: AWS Auto-scaling event with EC2 instances that use systemd (Amazon Linux, CentOs/RedHat 7 and newer, Ubuntu 16 and newer, Suse 12 and newer, Debian 9 and newer) User-initiated shutdown of Windows systems User-initiated shutdown of Linux systems that use systemd (Amazon Linux, CentOs/RedHat 7 and newer, Ubuntu 16 and newer, Suse 12 and newer, Debian 9 and newer) We know that these scenarios are not detected by the agent: User-initiated shutdown of Linux systems that don't use systemd (CentOs/RedHat 6 and earlier, Ubuntu 14, Debian 8). This includes other modern Linux systems that still use Upstart or SysV init systems.

      "body": "Problem The New Relic infrastructure agent is consuming too much CPU. Solution The New Relic infrastructure agent is designed to report a broad range of system data with minimal CPU and memory consumption. However, if you have a need to reduce your CPU consumption, you can disable or decrease the sampling frequency of various samplers and plugins. This topic highlights some newrelic-infra.yml configurations that may reduce your CPU usage: Reduce event sampling Reduce agent plugin reporting Review on-host integrations Reduce event sampling The infrastructure agent reports several default events at specific frequencies. To lower the overhead, you can reduce the sampling frequency in seconds, or you can completely disable the samplers by setting the corresponding property value to -1. Important We don't recommend a sample rate larger than 60 seconds because you may see gaps in the New Relic user interface charts. The table below lists some samplers to configure: Event Sampling frequency Allow/deny list Network Network sampling rate Not available Process Process sampling rate Allow list (Windows only) Storage Storage sampling rate Deny list System System sampling rate Not available Reduce agent plugin reporting The infrastructure agent has built-in plugins that collect inventory data (specific system configuration and state information). For some systems, the CPU consumption may be relatively high if the plugins are gathering a lot of data. To reduce the footprint, you can disable or decrease the sampling frequency for specific plugins that report data you don’t want. How to enable and disable plugins Disable a single plugin: To disable a plugin, set the corresponding property value to -1. Disable all plugins: disable_all_plugins: true Enable selected plugins: To enable certain plugins, insert an exception in disable_all_plugins. For example, the following configuration disables all plugins, but the Network Interfaces plugin reports every 120 seconds: disable_all_plugins: true network_interface_interval_sec: 120 Copy Disable SELinux semodule -l (Linux only) The SELinux plugin periodically invokes the semodule -l system command to get information about the existing SELinux modules. In most CentOS/RedHat distributions, this command will generate CPU consumption peaks. To disable this functionality, insert the following configuration option in your /etc/newrelic-infra.yml file: selinux_enable_semodule: false Reduce or disable Sysctl (Linux only) The Sysctl plugin walks the whole /sys directory structure and reads values from all the files there. Disabling it or reducing the interval may decrease some CPU System time in the Infrastructure agent. You can disable inventory frequency by setting it to a negative number or reduce the frequeny by setting the sysctl_interval_sec configuration value to the number of seconds between consecutive executions of the plugin. For example, to execute the plugin once every 10 minutes: sysctl_interval_sec: 600 Copy To disable the Sysctl plugin: sysctl_interval_sec: -1 Copy The current default value for the sysctl_interval_sec property is 60. Additional plugins to reduce or disable The following inventory plugins are not especially CPU consuming, but you can still reduce their frequency or disable them by setting the corresponding configuration options. Linux plugins For configuration of these Linux plugins, see Plugin variables: Cloud Security Groups Daemon Tools DPKG Facter Kernel Modules Network interfaces RPM SELinux Supervisord Sysctl Systemd SysV Upstart Users SSHD configuration Windows plugins For configuration of these Windows plugins, see Plugin variables: Network interfaces Windows services Windows updates Review on-host integrations If you use infrastructure on-host integrations, this may have additional impacts on CPU usage. The nature of the impact and the methods to adjust the impact depend on the integration you're using. Here are some ways to adjust on-host integration CPU usage: See if your integration has configuration options you can adjust. If possible, spread out the monitoring load by adding additional infrastructure agents. For example, the Kafka integration allows a multi-agent deployment.",

      "body": "Problem When APM and infrastructure agents are installed on the same hosts and use the same New Relic license key, APM data should appear in Infrastructure, and vice versa. If you do not see this APM-Infrastructure linkage, follow these troubleshooting tips. Solution If you completed the APM/Infrastructure integration but do not see New Relic APM data in Infrastructure, try these troubleshooting procedures. Restart the app server. If you have not restarted your APM-monitored application in a few weeks or months, the data streams from Infrastructure and APM may not be linked. Restart your app server. Generate some traffic for your app. Wait a few minutes, and then check for APM data in infrastructure monitoring. Make sure the hostnames are the same in APM and Infrastructure. If the hostnames are different in APM and infrastructure monitoring, New Relic cannot integrate the data. One common cause for this issue is that the default hostnames are different. For example, infrastructure monitoring uses a host's FQDN (such as myhost1.example.com), while APM uses the host's name (such as myhost1). Go to one[.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com) > APM > (select an app). From the app's APM Overview page, look at the app's associated host name. Compare that name with the same host's name in infrastructure monitoring. If the names are different, either set the APM agent host's display_name to match its FQDN, or set the host's display_name in Infrastructure to match the one set in APM. Check for replacement host FQDN recognition problems. If the APM-Infrastructure integration previously worked but has stopped, the server may have been replaced by another server that has the same FQDN. If both servers existed simultaneously for a period of time, New Relic cannot automatically recognize the new server. That will break the connection between APM and infrastructure data. To solve this problem, get help at support.newrelic.com. To prevent this problem, make sure there is a time gap between taking down an old server going down and creating a new server.",

      "body": "New Relic's infrastructure agent gathers its own data as well as integrations's logs and consolidates them in a single source. By default, logs appear in standard-output and are added to a log file. To disable logs in standard output, see the agent's config options. Logging severity levels Infrastructure uses a subset of the standard Syslog severity levels: ERROR: Error conditions met WARN: Warning conditions met INFO: Informational messages DEBUG: Contains debug-level messages (useful when troubleshooting) Important DEBUG level is only shown when the verbose mode is enabled. Log formatting For infrastructure agent v1.4.9 or higher, log messages are inlined with context values. This offers better grouping and filtering; for example: containerized agent found in container containerID: VALUE Copy By default, Infrastructure logs are formatted as text: In foreground mode, log output is colored, without a timestamp: DEBUG Sending deltas divided in blocks component=PatchSender mentityKey=ohaimaci mnumberOfBlocks=1 Copy In background mode, logs are timestamped output, used when running as a service or dumping logs to a file: time=\"2019-07-12T09:54:15+02:00\" level=info msg=\"Agent service manager shutdown completed successfully.\" component=AgentService service=newrelic-infra Copy Alternatively, logs can be formatted as a JSON file: {\"context\":{},\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"upstart_interval_sec: 0\",\"timestamp\":\"2019-07-11T18:24:03+02:00\"} {\"context\":{},\"level\":\"info\",\"msg\":\"plugin_dir: \",\"timestamp\":\"2019-07-11T18:24:03+02:00\"} Copy To change the log format, see the agent configuration settings. Log rotation The infrastructure agent does not provide any native log rotation or compression mechanism. Instead, we encourage you to use consolidated log rotation tools, such as the Linux logrotate tool, which is usually installed by default in most Linux distributions. Logrotate can be configured as an entry in /etc/logrotate.conf, or as a file in the /etc/logrotate.d directory. Logrotate config file sample A sample logrotate config file looks like this: /var/log/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.log { copytruncate compress daily dateext maxage 7 } Copy Where: /var/log/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.log: The Infrastructure agent log file. It must match the log_file configuration parameter in the /etc/newrelic-infra.yml file. copytruncate: Indicates that the log file is truncated but not deleted when it is rotated. This configuration option is mandatory, otherwise the log file will be deleted and won’t be recreated. compress: Compresses (usually in Gzip format) the rotated log files. daily: The agent rotates logs daily. dateext: Appends a date (by default, in the format YYYYMMDD) to the rotated log file (e.g. newrelic-infra.log-20190708.gz) maxage 7: Makes logrotate remove rotated files after 7 days. Tip For a complete description of the logrotate configuration options, see the Linux Logrotate documentation. Since logrotate is usually executed automatically as a cron job, verify that there is a logrotate entry in cron (for example, /etc/cron.daily/logrotate) similar to: #!/bin/sh /usr/sbin/logrotate -s /var/lib/logrotate/logrotate.status /etc/logrotate.conf EXITVALUE=$? if [ $EXITVALUE != 0 ]; then /usr/bin/logger -t logrotate \"ALERT exited abnormally with [$EXITVALUE]\" fi exit 0 Copy Smart verbose mode For infrastructure agent versions 1.9.0 or higher, you can enable smart verbose mode for logs. Smart verbose mode prevents debug messages being logged until an error message is logged. Once an error has been logged, the cached debug messages are logged, but only the most recent number of configured debug messages. For example, if you have a configured limit of 10, after an error is logged, only the 10 most recent debug messages are logged, and older logs are discarded. For more information on how to enable smart verbose mode and the debug message limit, see Infrastructure configuration settings. Logging before Infrastructure agent v1.4.9 Here is a comparison of functionality for Infrastructure agent versions before and after v1.4.9: Agent v1.4.9 and higher Before v1.4.9 Foreground mode logged. The agent couldn't log some entries in foreground mode because the logging service wasn't able to write data until the agent was completely configured. Logs in text and JSON formats. Logs in text only. Logs displayed as inline text. Logs displayed as static literals in a single, decontextualized line. Integration log management Integrations write JSON payloads into STDOUT and plain-text (JSON structured in the future) logs into STDERR. The infrastructure agent handles integration STDERR lines and forward this output into the agent one, usually the service log. Agent handles each STDERR line as follows: when agent runs in verbose mode: it just forwards the full STDERR line as a DEBUG agent log entry placing integration line contexts within the ` msg ` field. otherwise: it parses the line against the expected format (see below) and only logs as agent ERROR level, entries produced by integrations with ` fatal ` or ` error ` severity levels. In this case fields are extracted and forwarded in structured manner (therefore if JSON output is enabled for the agent fields become queryable. Integration STDERR expected format A line is expected to be a list of key-value pairs separated by an equal character. Keys can contain any character, whereas values can have three different formats: string: < quote>any character including escaped quotes \\ \" < quote> map: & { any character} word: any character except spaces Internally agent used this regex to extract the fields: ([^\\s]*?)=(\".*?[^\\\\]\"|&{.*?}|[^\\s]*) Copy For instance, this line: time=\"2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00\" level=error msg=\"Foo bar baz\" foo=bar Copy Will generate a structured agent log line with these fields: - \"time\": \"2015-03-26T01:27:38-04:00\" - \"level\": \"error\" - \"msg\": \"Foo bar baz\" - \"foo\": \"bar\" Copy",

      "body": "Problem When troubleshooting your infrastructure agent, generate verbose logs for a few minutes to find and investigate errors. This can be useful for your own troubleshooting or when working with New Relic Support. Important Verbose logging generates a lot of data very quickly. When finished generating logs, be sure to set verbose: 0 to reduce disk space consumption. If you have New Relic infrastructure agent 1.4.0 or higher, you can automate this process by using the newrelic-infra-ctl command. For more information, see the troubleshooting binary documentation. Solution Generating verbose log files requires editing your configuration file. For a sample config file that includes all applicable settings, see the example template. To generate detailed logs: Step Procedures Edit your newrelic-infra.yml file: Enable verbose logging: verbose: 1. (If you use a containerized infrastructure agent on CoreOS, see system-specific notes.) Set log_file to a convenient log file location. Restart the agent so the agent notices the new settings. Let your host run at normal load for about three minutes to generate sufficient logging data. Return your settings to default: Disable verbose logging by setting verbose: 0 in newrelic-infra.yml. Optional: Disable logging to a custom file by removing the log_file line from newrelic-infra.yml. Restart the agent so the agent notices the new settings. Examine the log file for errors. If you need to send your log file to New Relic Support: Include the line in your log file that contains the agent version: New Relic infrastructure agent version X.YY.ZZZ Copy Attach the log file to your support ticket, along with your newrelic-infra.yml. Smart verbose mode Sometimes errors don't occur until after quite some time has passed. This makes debugging difficult, because typically verbose logs are only enabled for a short period time; otherwise there will be many debug logs. For example, if an error occurs one hour after the infrastructure agent has started, getting debug logs around the time of the error can be tricky or impractical. As of infrastructure agent v1.9.0 or higher, you can use smart verbose mode for logs. Smart verbose mode only logs the most recent debug messages after an error has been logged. This allows you to leave smart verbose mode running until an error occurs, without logging lots of irrelevant debug messages, and only logging the most recent debug messages. (The number of messages is determined by your configuration.) For more information on smart verbose mode, see the Infrastructure agent logging behavior docs, and use the Infrastructure configuration settings documentation for details on how to enable smart verbose mode. Forward the agent logs to New Relic Logs The Infrastructure agent can be configured to send its own logs to New Relic Logs. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues with log forwarding, the Infrastructure agent, or when contacting support. For details on how to enable log forwarding for the Infrastructure agent, see Troubleshoot log forwarding. Notes for specific systems These are some additional notes and requirements for specific systems, used to supplement the general logging instructions: Containerized agent on CoreOS If you are using a containerized infrastructure agent on CoreOS: Choose one of these options to change the log level to verbose: Recommended: Set the environment variable NRIA_VERBOSE to 1. Running this on the command line would look like: -e NRIA_VERBOSE=1 Copy OR Edit the config file to set verbose: 1. (Editing the config file in a container is not recommended, because it requires rebuilding the image twice: once to add verbose logging and once to remove it.) Use journalctl to collect the logs: journalctl -u newrelic-infra > newrelic-infra.log Copy Set the verbose logging level back to 0 after collecting logs for a few minutes.",

      "body": "Use the Hosts page to better understand important performance metrics, like resource usage, network and processes performance, and data about your containers. You can filter your hosts by attributes and compare their performance with inventory change events to help determine root causes. You can also set alert notifications to help prevent problems. To view your hosts information, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts, then click any of the following tabs: System: Overview of your hosts' performance Network: Bandwidth and error data about your network interfaces Processes: Data about CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual or groups of processes Storage: Resources' capacity and efficiency, including your devices' overall utilization, disk usage, or I/O operations Docker containers: CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual or group of containers System tab Here are the default graphs shown on the Hosts page. For additional chart options, select the dropdown for any chart. CPU %: On the System tab, CPU Percent is a derived metric that is part of the SystemSample event. The CPU percentage is not collected by New Relic, but derived from several other metrics. Specifically, the cpuPercent attribute is an aggregation of cpuUserPercent, cpuSystemPercent, cpuIoWaitPercent and cpuStealPercent. Load average five minute: represents an average of the number of tasks waiting to do work on a system over the last 5 minutes. Memory free %: compares the amount of free memory bytes to the amount of used memory bytes. For explanations of different chart metrics, see Default infrastructure attributes and events. Functions for adjusting chart data include: Select different host groups: Use the host filter. Change time range: Use the time picker above the charts, or drag and select a time range on a chart. Change the number of elements on charts: use the Chart shows dropdown. Change data used to order hosts: Use the table below the charts to order the chart elements by different metrics; for example, from highest to lowest CPU user % to lowest, or from lowest to highest Disk free. System tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the System tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group hosts Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use group by to aggregate the results. Understand host health Use the Health column of the table. To see more details about specific violations, select the health status icons. Find root causes of issues Use the Events heatmap at the top of the page to compare performance to important events happening in your infrastructure. For more, see Events heatmap. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart, select and then Create alert. View host's alert threshold violation If present, select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. APM and infrastructure data If you have APM data associated with your infrastructure data, there are several ways to access your APM data on the Hosts page: Use the hosts filter to filter on hosts running specific applications. In the host list below the charts, select the Application column to filter on specific applications. From the chart selector dropdown beside a chart's name, select one of the application-related charts. Important APM charts in infrastructure monitoring do not have View query or Create alert options like the other infrastructure charts do. For more about using APM and infrastructure monitoring together, see APM data in infrastructure. Network tab The Network page provides real-time visibility into the health and performance of individual hosts, web servers, or other groups of resources across your network. Default charts show bandwidth metrics by packet, bandwidth by bytes, and errors per second. Details about individual interfaces can help you: Examine saturation levels across your network or for selected filter sets. Compare load balances between specific resources. Identify unexpected differences in capacity patterns between similar hosts. Evaluate the top five network errors that New Relic automatically presents for the selected time period. This real-time network data can then help you determine whether to resolve errors by reconfiguring your network, rebalancing the loads, or taking other preventative maintenance actions before needing to make a purchase decision. From the Network tab you can view bandwidth and error data about your network interfaces. The Network page includes an Events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Network page chart, see NetworkSample attributes. Network tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Network tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use Group by to aggregate the results. Select a time range Use the time picker to change the range of time selected. You can also click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. When you select a time range, it carries over when you go from one infrastructure page to another. Change metrics displayed in chart Use the sorting dropdown to switch what metric the chart is displaying for the chosen process groupings, including: Received Bytes Received Dropped Received Errors Received Packets Transmitted Bytes Transmitted Dropped Transmitted Errors Transmitted Packets Search and filter the list Type in the Search interfaces search bar to filter the list to only those items containing the text you've typed. You can also filter the list by simply selecting the list item or user name you want to filter for. The chosen filters are displayed beside the filter icon above the chart. Add items to chart The chart, by default, displays the top five results. Use the Chart shows dropdown to display more results. To remove an item from a chart, select its name below the chart. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart, select and then Create alert. (Not available on APM charts.) View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Processes tab Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Use the Processes tab to get information about processes running on your hosts, and to set alerts on process metrics. The Processes tab shows data such as CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual processes or groupings of processes. The page also includes an events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. Use this information to: Pinpoint processes that are causing performance issues. Create alerts for conditions such as CPU percentage and memory usage. On the Processes page, CPU percent is scoped to individual processes, rather than hosts. Because of this, the CPU percent metric does not take into account the resources of the entire system. Instead, it shows how much of a single CPU core each process is taking. Example Here's an example of how to pinpoint an issue and set an alert: You notice on the Hosts page that a cluster has a CPU percentage much higher than normal. You go to the Processes page and filter down to that cluster's processes. You notice that several instances of the same process have excessive CPU percentage. After fixing the issue, you decide to create an alert condition that triggers when the CPU percentage for that process type exceeds a certain threshold. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Processes page chart, see ProcessSample attributes. Tip You cannot start, stop, or restart processes from the UI. Instead, follow standard procedures to start, stop, check, or restart the infrastructure agent manually. Processes tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Processes tab: If you want to... Do this... Only show hosts matching certain criteria Use filter sets. Aggregate results or group by host attributes Use Group by to change how the processes are grouped in the chart and the list. The dropdown contains host-related attributes such as hostID and entityName. If you are monitoring AWS EC2 instances, EC2-related attributes such as awsRegion will be available. Select a time range Use either of these options: Select any of the time picker options at the top of the page. Click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. After you select a time range, it carries over from one infrastructure page to another. View Docker metrics To view process usage by Docker containers, see Docker instrumentation. Change charts Select the dropdown beside the chart's name to switch what metric the chart displays. Choices include: Memory: Resident or virtual size CPU percentage Disk I/O: Read or write Search and filter the list Use either of these options: Type in the Search processes search bar. Select the list item or user name you want to filter for. The selected filters appear beside the filter icon above the chart, where you can select and remove them as needed. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart. Select and then Create alert. (Not available on APM charts.) View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Storage tab The Storage page allows you to monitor your resources' capacity and efficiency, including your devices' overall utilization, disk usage, or I/O operations. This can help you to: Examine unexpected patterns; for example, a cluster of mirrored machines that do not process I/O tasks uniformly. Monitor usage levels before disk space completely runs out. Set alert conditions to notify you about problems with one or more hosts; for example, long processing times for read or write operations, disk availability or utilization based on percentage or bytes, etc. Make informed decisions about where to redistribute hosts with higher or lower than normal processing requests. Use data to help plan for additions or changes to your infrastructure budget before an emergency arises. The Storage page includes an Events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. For a technical explanation of the attributes used to populate the Storage page chart, see StorageSample attributes. Storage tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Storage tab: If you want to... Do this... Filter and group Use filter sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria, or use Group by to aggregate the results. Select a time range Use the time picker on the upper right to change the range of time selected. You can also click and drag on the chart to select a custom time range. When you select a time range, it carries over when you go from one infrastructure page to another. Change metrics displayed in chart Use the sorting dropdown to switch what metric the chart is displaying for the chosen process groupings. Choices include: Total Utilization % Read Utilization % Write Utilization % Disk Used Bytes Disk Free Bytes I/O Read Operations I/O Write Operations Search and filter the list Type in the Search devices search bar to filter the list. You can also filter the list by simply selecting the list item or user name you want to filter for. The chosen filters are displayed beside the filter icon above the chart. Add/remove chart items The chart, by default, displays the top five results. Use the Chart shows dropdown to display more results. To remove an item, select its name below the chart. Set an alert condition for a metric Mouse over a chart. Select and then Create alert. (Not available on APM charts.) View host's alert threshold violation Select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Docker containers tab Use the Docker containers tab to get information about the containers running on your hosts, and to set alerts on container metrics. The Docker containers tab shows data such as CPU percentage, I/O bytes, and memory usage for individual containers or groupings of containers. The page also includes an events heatmap, which provides a snapshot of the events occurring within the same time range as the displayed metrics. Use this information to: Identify containers that are experiencing performance issues. Create alerts for conditions such as CPU percentage and memory usage. Docker containers tab functions Here are some of the things you can do from the Docker containers tab: If you want to... Do this... Only show hosts matching certain criteria Use filter sets. Aggregate results or group by host attributes Use Group by to change how the processes are grouped in the chart and the list. The dropdown contains host-related attributes such as image and operatingSystem. Select a time range Use either of these options: Select any of the time picker options at the top of the page.

      "body": "New Relic can collect detailed information about a system's configuration per host, including system modules, configuration files, metadata, packages, services, user sessions, etc. The Inventory page provides a real-time, filterable, searchable view into each host's configuration. Use the Inventory page to: Ensure a version update was applied successfully across all your hosts. Audit version discrepancies across your hosts. Quickly identify which hosts require an update to fix a security vulnerability. To view and search your inventory data: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Inventory. Inventory item naming The infrastructure inventory is a qualified namespace (structured like a directory) that organizes inventory items into names that resemble a source path. The inventory item name is comprised of three elements: Element Description Category Basic, top level type of data source, typically based on its role in the system. Common examples include config, package, kernel, user session, services, and modules. Source The specific data source for the inventory item. Label The name of the specific inventory item; for example, the filename, package name, or system setting name. Tip For detailed metadata and other information about your hosts, use tagging with New Relic One. Page functions Use Inventory page functions to find information about a particular item on your hosts: Filter the data Use Filter Sets to show only hosts matching certain criteria. Search inventory Search for an inventory item using the search function. For example, if you want to find information related to OpenSSL, search openssl. The search term is matched again the inventory item name. View inventory item details Inventory item details provide host and system information for each host it resides on according to the New Relic inventory item name. If you have different versions of the same item on other hosts, New Relic detects that and flags them on the Inventory page with the variant hosts label and lists each host running each version. Item details are attributes (key/value pairs) that are dictated by their source. Specific attributes are generally stable over time, but new ones may be added and others could be deprecated. Attributes carry the critical metadata that are at the heart of each inventory item. Common inventory item attributes include: Variant hosts (hostname) Architecture Description Essential Priority Status Version View host's alert threshold violations To view one or more host's alert threshold violations, select the host's Critical icon or Warning icon. Inventory data collection Inventory is collected from the infrastructure agent's built-in data collectors, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) integrations, agent integrations provided by New Relic, and customer-built integrations.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

It also forwards data from infrastructure integrations to New Relic, as well as log data for log analytics. There are multiple ways to install and deploy the infrastructure monitoring agent, depending on your setup and needs. This document describes how the infrastructure monitoring agent works and how to install it. Tip To use infrastructure monitoring and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Quick start: Use our guided install The quickest way to get started with our infrastructure monitoring agent is through our guided install. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install not only installs the infrastructure agent, but also discovers the applications and log sources running in your environment. It recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your infrastructure. Important If you install the agent using the New Relic One UI, the Infrastructure status API is enabled by default. One agent, many capabilities Our infrastructure monitoring agent collects performance and health data about the system resources and processes of the host where it's enabled (on-premises or virtualized). At the same time, it acts as a forwarder for two types of data: core services metrics, which are collected by on-host integrations, and logs. If you want to collect data about core services running on your host, you need to install the infrastructure monitoring agent first, and then install or enable on-host integrations. Our infrastructure monitoring agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services. It can also forward logs to New Relic. Backend application metrics (APM) are collected by separate language agents. Notice how each integration and forwarder feed different data types in the New Relic database (NRDB). Install the infrastructure monitoring agent If our guided install doesn't work for your setup, follow the instructions for your Linux, Windows, or other setup. The infrastructure monitoring agent can currently run on many Linux distributions, as well as Windows Server. For more information on where you can run the agent, check the compatibility and requirements page. Linux The preferred way to install the Linux agent is through the package manager of your distribution. Select your distribution from the list for step-by-step instructions. Amazon Linux CentOS Container (Docker) Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Other Linux distros To use these installation links, you must be logged to your New Relic account. If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or if you prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced install needs, you can deploy the agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual mode. Windows Server and 10 To deploy the agent on a Windows Server host, install it using our MSI installer. For a guided procedure, click the button below and follow the step-by-step instructions: Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced installation needs, you can deploy the agent using our zip files in assisted or manual mode. Other installation scenarios The infrastructure monitoring agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Check the source code The infrastructure monitoring agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README. What's next After you've installed the infrastructure monitoring agent: Learn how to configure the agent or edit the config template. Install on-host integrations (for example, for Apache or MySQL).

      "body": "The infrastructure agent has a large set of configuration settings to fine-tune its behavior. Here we: List all the configuration options (in both their YAML and the environment variable names). Explain what the settings do and when to use them. Give the variable type and default value (if any). List the minimum required agent version as applicable. For an example of how all these variables can be used, see our sample configuration template. Important license_key is the only required setting. Agent variables license_key (REQUIRED) Specifies the license key for your New Relic account. The agent uses this key to associate your server's metrics with your New Relic account. This setting is created as part of the standard installation process. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version license_key NRIA_LICENSE_KEY string Example: license_key: 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234 Copy fedramp Specifies whether Fedramp endpoints should be used. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version fedramp NRIA_FEDRAMP boolean false 1.15.0 max_procs Specifies the number of logical processors available to the agent. Increasing this value helps to distribute the load between different cores. If set to -1, the agent will try to read the environment variable GOMAXPROCS. If this variable is not set, the default value will be the total number of cores available in the host. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version max_procs NRIA_MAX_PROCS integer 1 1.0.1002 payload_compression_level Since version 1.0.804 or higher, data sent from the agent is compressed by default. To disable payload compression, set payload_compression_level to 0. Important Recommendation: Do not change this setting. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version payload_compression_level NRIA_PAYLOAD_COMPRESSION_LEVEL integer 6 1.0.804 startup_connection_retries Number of times the agent will retry the request to check New Relic's platform availability at startup before throwing an error.

If cloud detection fails during the initialization of the agent, it will retry for CloudMaxRetryCount times. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version cloud_retry_backoff_sec NRIA_CLOUD_RETRY_BACKOFF_SEC integer 60 1.2.6 disable_cloud_instance_id Similar to DisableCloudMetadata, but it disables the collection of cloud metadata only for the host alias plugin. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_cloud_instance_id NRIA_DISABLE_CLOUD_INSTANCE_ID boolean false 1.0.220 disable_cloud_metadata Disables the collection of cloud metadata. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_cloud_metadata NRIA_DISABLE_CLOUD_METADATA boolean false 1.0.690 Debug variables trace Enables traces to be printed in the logs for the given features. Traces are additional log entries used for debugging purposes of specific features, they are only shown when the verbose log config option is enabled. Currently two features have traces defined: connect and attributes. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version trace NRIA_TRACE [ ]string [] 1.0.1015 Example as a YAML attribute: trace: [connect, attributes] Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_TRACE='connect, attributes' Copy Docker variables container_cache_metadata_limit Time, in seconds, before the cached containers metadata expires and the agent needs to fetch them again.

YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version custom_supported_file_systems NRIA_CUSTOM_SUPPORTED_FILESYSTEMS [ ]string Linux: [\"xfs\", \"btrfs\", \"ext\", \"ext2\", \"ext3\", \"ext4\", \"hfs\", \"vxfs\"] Windows: [\"NTFS\", \"ReFS\"] 1.0.220 file_devices_ignored List of storage devices to be ignored by the agent when gathering StorageSample data. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version file_devices_ignored NRIA_FILE_DEVICES_IGNORED [ ]string 1.0.220 Example as a YAML attribute: file_devices_ignored: - sda1 - sda2 Copy Example as an environment variable: FILE_DEVICES_IGNORED=\"sda1,sda2\" Copy Hostname variables display_name Overrides the auto-generated hostname for reporting. This is useful when you have multiple hosts with the same name, since our infrastructure monitoring uses the hostname as the unique identifier for each host. Keep in mind this value is also used for the loopback address replacement on entity names. For more information, see our documentation on how entity name resolution works. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version display_name NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME string empty 1.0.266 Example: display_name: teslaOne Copy dns_hostname_resolution When true, the full hostname is resolved by performing a reverse lookup of the host's address. Otherwise, it will be retrieved with the hostname command on Linux and from the TCP/IP parameters of the registry on Windows. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version dns_hostname_resolution NRIA_DNS_HOSTNAME_RESOLUTION boolean true 1.2.6 override_hostname When set, this is the value that will be reported for the full hostname; otherwise, the agent will perform the normal lookup behavior. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version override_hostname NRIA_OVERRIDE_HOSTNAME string 1.0.1015 Example: my.custom-hostname.co.org Copy override_hostname_short When set, this is the value that will be reported for the hostname; otherwise, the agent will perform the normal lookup behavior. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version override_hostname_short NRIA_OVERRIDE_HOSTNAME_SHORT string 1.0.1015 Example: my.custom-hostname Copy Installation variables agent_dir Directory where the agent stores files for cache, inventory, integrations, etc. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version agent_dir NRIA_AGENT_DIR string Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra Windows: C:\\Program Files\\NewRelic\\newrelic-infra\\ 1.0.2 plugin_dir Directory containing the configuration files of the integrations. Each integration has its own configuration file, named by default <integration_name>-config.yml, placed in a predefined location from which the agent loads on initialization. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version plugin_dir NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR string Linux: etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Windows: \\Program Files\\NewRelic\\newrelic-infra\\inregrations.d 1.0.2 Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. custom_plugin_installation_dir Specifies a custom path to install integrations, which allows to install them outside the agent_dir. It has priority when the agent is looking for installed integrations. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version custom_plugin_installation_dir NRIA_CUSTOM_PLUGIN_INSTALLATION_DIR string Empty 1.0.2 Integrations variables passthrough_environment A list of environment variables that will be passed to all integrations. If an integration already has an existing configuration option with the same name, then the environment variable takes precedence. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version passthrough_environment NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT [ ]string Empty 1.0.719 Example as a YAML attribute (inside the agent's configuration file, located by default in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml): passthrough_environment: - HOST - PORT Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT=\"HOST,PORT\" Copy entityname_integrations_v2_update The agent enables loopback-address replacement on the entity name (and therefore key) automatically for version 3 of the integration protocol. If you are using version 2 of the protocol and want this behavior, enable the entityname_integrations_v2_update option. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version entityname_integrations_v2_update NRIA_ENTITYNAME_INTEGRATIONS_V2_UPDATE boolean false 1.2.15 http_server_enabled By setting this configuration parameter to true the agent will open an HTTP port (by default, 8001) to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_enabled NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_ENABLED boolean false 1.0.818 http_server_host By setting this value, the agent will start listening on the HTTPServerPort to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_host NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_HOST string localhost 1.0.818 http_server_port Sets the port for the http server to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_port NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_PORT integer 8001 1.0.818 remove_entities_period Starts the process of deleting entities that haven't reported information during this interval. Valid time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), and h (hour). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version remove_entities_period NRIA_REMOVE_ENTITIES_PERIOD string 48h 1.0.859 Example: 1h Copy Inventory variables offline_time_to_reset If the cached inventory becomes older than this value (for example, because the agent is offline), the agent automatically removes and recreates the delta store. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version offline_time_to_reset NRIA_OFFLINE_TIME_TO_RESET string 24h 1.0.888 ignored_inventory The list of inventory paths ignored by the agent. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version ignored_inventory NRIA_IGNORED_INVENTORY string [ ] Empty list 1.0.336 Example as a YAML attribute: ignored_inventory: - files/config/stuff.bar - files/config/stuff.foo Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_IGNORED_INVENTORY=\"files/config/stuff.bar,files/config/stuff.foo\" Copy Linux variables pid_file Location on Linux where the pid file of the agent process is created. It is used at startup to ensure that no other instances of the agent are running. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version pid_file NRIA_PID_FILE string /var/run/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.pid 1.0.2 ignore_reclaimable When true, formulation of the host virtual memory considers SReclaimable as available memory; otherwise SReclaimable will be considered part of the used memory. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version ignore_reclaimable NRIA_IGNORE_RECLAIMABLE boolean false 1.2.6 Logging variables log_file Defines the file path for the logs. The default installation creates a log directory and it sets this filepath value in the log_file configuration option for you. This log directory is different for each OS, as shown below. Change this configuration option to customize the file path for the logs. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_file NRIA_LOG_FILE string See below * Default paths: Linux: If not defined, it logs only in the standard output. Windows, agent version 1.0.752 or lower: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.775 to 1.0.944: C:\\%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.944 or higher: C:\\%ProgramData%\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy If the directory can't be created: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy log_format Defines the log output format. Available values: text: Plain text output, one line per log entry. json: JSON-formatted output, one line per log entry. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_format NRIA_LOG_FORMAT string text 1.4.9 log_to_stdout By default all logs are displayed in both standard output and a log file. To disable logs in the standard output, set this configuration option to false. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_to_stdout NRIA_LOG_TO_STDOUT boolean true 1.0.703 verbose When verbose is set to 0, verbose logging is off, but the agent still creates logs. Set this to 1 to create verbose logs to use in troubleshooting the agent; set verbose to 2 to use the smart verbose mode logging. Smart verbose mode logs the last smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit debug messages when an error is logged. Setting verbose to 3 enables forwarding the agent logs to New Relic Logs. Important Verbose logging can generate a lot of data very quickly. Run the agent in verbose mode only for as long as necessary to reproduce your issue, then set verbose: 0 and restart your agent to disable verbose logging. Alternatively, you can set verbose: 2, which will enable smart verbose mode. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version verbose NRIA_VERBOSE Integer (0, 1, 2 or 3) 0 1.9.0 when using smart mode (2) 1.11.4 when forwarding the New Relic Logs (3) smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit refers to the number of previous debug messages that will be logged when an error is logged. For example, if the limit is set to 5, debug logs will be cached in memory until an error is logged, at which point the previous 5 debug messages will also be logged Important This configuration option is only used when verbose is set to 2 (Smart Verbose Mode enabled). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit NRIA_SMART_VERBOSE_MODE_ENTRY_LIMIT Integer 1000 1.9.0 Metrics variables custom_attributes Custom attributes are key-value pairs (similar to tags in other tools) used to annotate the data from the Infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. For example, you might indicate a machine's environment (staging or production), the service a machine hosts (login service, for example), or the team responsible for that machine. Tip The agent collects many details about your environment as part of its default attributes, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) tags. YML option name Environment variable Type custom_attributes NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES map [ string]interface { } Use a list of custom attributes to annotate the data from this agent instance. Separate keys and values with colons :, as in KEY: VALUE, and separate each key-value pair with a line break. Keys can be any valid YAML except slashes /. Values can be any YAML string, including spaces. Example as a YAML attribute: custom_attributes: environment: production service: login service team: alpha-team Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES='{\"customAttribute_1\":\"SOME_ATTRIBUTE\",\"customAttribute_2\": \"SOME_ATTRIBUTE_2\"}' Copy NRQL example filtering by custom attribute: FROM SystemSample SELECT * WHERE environment = 'production' Copy enable_process_metrics Important Requires infrastructure agent version 1.12.0 or higher. Accounts created before July 20, 2020 and/or infrastructure agents installed using the new Guided Install have this variable enabled by default. Enables the sending of process metrics to New Relic. By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. The agent still collects such data, unless metrics_process_sample_rate is set to -1. To report metric data about all the operating system's processes, set enable_process_metrics to true. To disable, set to false. Sending all process data could increase the volume of data sent to New Relic. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. By default, processes using low memory are excluded from being sampled. For more information, see disable-zero-mem-process-filter. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version enable_process_metrics NRIA_ENABLE_PROCESS_METRICS boolean false include_matching_metrics Important Currently, this setting only applies to an operating system's processes metrics. You can control how much data is sent to New Relic by configuring include_matching_metrics, which allows you to restrict the transmission of metric data based on the values of metric attributes. You include metric data by defining literal or partial values for any of the attributes of the metric. For example, you can choose to send the host.process.cpuPercent of all processes whose process.name match the ^java regular expression. In this example, we include process metrics using executable files and names: include_matching_metrics: # You can combine attributes from different metrics process.name: - regex “^java” # Include all processes starting with \"java\" process.executable: - “/usr/bin/python2” # Include the Python 2.x executable - regex “\\\\System32\\\\svchost” # Include all svchost executables Copy If you need to include command line arguments in any of the values, set strip_command_line to false (the infrastructure agents removes CLI arguments by default to prevent secrets from leaking). To configure include_matching_metrics as an environment variable for the Kubernetes integration, add it in the manifest inside the env: object: env: - name: NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS value: | process.name: - regex \"^java\" process.executable: - \"/usr/bin/python2\" - regex \"\\\\System32\\\\svchost\" Copy Default YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version include_matching_metrics NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS metric.attribute: - regex \"pattern\" - \"string\" - \"string-with-wildcard * \" network_interface_filters You can use the network interface filters configuration to hide unused or uninteresting network interfaces from the infrastructure agent. This helps reduce resource usage, work, and noise in your data. Important Environment variables are not supported for this configuration setting. The configuration uses a simple pattern-matching mechanism that can look for interfaces that start with a specific sequence of letters or numbers following either pattern: {name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the prefix option [number]{name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the index-1 option New Relic infrastructure implements a curated default list of filters, available for both Linux and Windows, that you can modify. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version network_interface_filters not supported map [ string] [ ]string 1.0.220 Linux Default network interface filters for Linux: Network interfaces that start with dummy, lo, vmnet, sit, tun, tap, or veth Network interfaces that contain tun or tap The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with dummy or lo , or contain tun preceded by a sequence of numbers, and followed by other characters: network_interface_filters: prefix: - dummy - lo index-1: - tun Copy Windows Default network interface filters for Windows: Network interfaces that start with Loop, isatap, or Local The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with Loop: network_interface_filters: prefix: - Loop Copy disable_zero_mem_process_filter The ZeroRSSFilter excludes processes that are not using memory from being sampled. Disable the filter so that the agent includes these processes in the ProcessSample. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_zero_mem_process_filter NRIA_DISABLE_ZERO_MEM_PROCESS_FILTER boolean false 1.0.832 Plugins variables Tip You can quickly disable all the variables by setting DisableAllPlugins to true, and turn on only those options you need. disable_all_plugins To disable all the plugins, set this option to true.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding.

It also forwards data from infrastructure integrations to New Relic, as well as log data for log analytics. There are multiple ways to install and deploy the infrastructure monitoring agent, depending on your setup and needs. This document describes how the infrastructure monitoring agent works and how to install it.

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Quick start: Use our guided install The quickest way to get started with our infrastructure monitoring agent is through our guided install. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install not only installs the infrastructure agent, but also discovers the applications and log sources running in your environment. It recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your infrastructure. Important If you install the agent using the New Relic One UI, the Infrastructure status API is enabled by default. One agent, many capabilities Our infrastructure monitoring agent collects performance and health data about the system resources and processes of the host where it's enabled (on-premises or virtualized). At the same time, it acts as a forwarder for two types of data: core services metrics, which are collected by on-host integrations, and logs. If you want to collect data about core services running on your host, you need to install the infrastructure monitoring agent first, and then install or enable on-host integrations. Our infrastructure monitoring agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services. It can also forward logs to New Relic. Backend application metrics (APM) are collected by separate language agents. Notice how each integration and forwarder feed different data types in the New Relic database (NRDB). Install the infrastructure monitoring agent If our guided install doesn't work for your setup, follow the instructions for your Linux, Windows, or other setup. The infrastructure monitoring agent can currently run on many Linux distributions, as well as Windows Server. For more information on where you can run the agent, check the compatibility and requirements page. Linux The preferred way to install the Linux agent is through the package manager of your distribution. Select your distribution from the list for step-by-step instructions. Amazon Linux CentOS Container (Docker) Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Other Linux distros To use these installation links, you must be logged to your New Relic account. If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or if you prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced install needs, you can deploy the agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual mode. Windows Server and 10 To deploy the agent on a Windows Server host, install it using our MSI installer. For a guided procedure, click the button below and follow the step-by-step instructions: Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced installation needs, you can deploy the agent using our zip files in assisted or manual mode. Other installation scenarios The infrastructure monitoring agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Check the source code The infrastructure monitoring agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.

      "body": "The infrastructure agent has a large set of configuration settings to fine-tune its behavior. Here we: List all the configuration options (in both their YAML and the environment variable names). Explain what the settings do and when to use them. Give the variable type and default value (if any). List the minimum required agent version as applicable. For an example of how all these variables can be used, see our sample configuration template. Important license_key is the only required setting. Agent variables license_key (REQUIRED) Specifies the license key for your New Relic account. The agent uses this key to associate your server's metrics with your New Relic account. This setting is created as part of the standard installation process. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version license_key NRIA_LICENSE_KEY string Example: license_key: 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234 Copy fedramp Specifies whether Fedramp endpoints should be used. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version fedramp NRIA_FEDRAMP boolean false 1.15.0 max_procs Specifies the number of logical processors available to the agent. Increasing this value helps to distribute the load between different cores. If set to -1, the agent will try to read the environment variable GOMAXPROCS. If this variable is not set, the default value will be the total number of cores available in the host. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version max_procs NRIA_MAX_PROCS integer 1 1.0.1002 payload_compression_level Since version 1.0.804 or higher, data sent from the agent is compressed by default. To disable payload compression, set payload_compression_level to 0. Important Recommendation: Do not change this setting. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version payload_compression_level NRIA_PAYLOAD_COMPRESSION_LEVEL integer 6 1.0.804 startup_connection_retries Number of times the agent will retry the request to check New Relic's platform availability at startup before throwing an error. If set to a negative value, the agent will keep checking the connection until it succeeds. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version startup_connection_retries NRIA_STARTUP_CONNECTION_RETRIES integer 6 1.0.936 startup_connection_retry_time After a request has timed out, time the agent waits to retry a request to check New Relic's platform availability at startup. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version startup_connection_retry_time NRIA_STARTUP_CONNECTION_RETRY_TIME string 5s 1.0.936 - 1.2.30 startup_connection_timeout Time the agent waits until a request to check New Relic's platform availability at startup is considered timed out. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version startup_connection_timeout NRIA_STARTUP_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT string 10s 1.0.936 Cloud variables If the agent is running in a cloud instance, the agent will try to detect the cloud type and fetch metadata. cloud_max_retry_count Sets the number of times the agent retries to connect in case that cloud detection fails. If cloud detection fails during the initialization of the agent, the agent will retry after waiting for CloudRetryBackOffSec seconds. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version cloud_max_retry_count NRIA_CLOUD_MAX_RETRY_COUNT integer 10 1.2.6 cloud_metadata_expiry_sec Sets the interval of time the agent will wait until discarding the metadata, in seconds. After this period metadata expires and the agent will fetch it again. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version cloud_metadata_expiry_sec NRIA_CLOUD_METADATA_EXPIRY_SEC integer 300 1.2.6 cloud_retry_backoff_sec Sets the interval of time the agent waits between cloud detection retries in case that cloud detection failed, in seconds. If cloud detection fails during the initialization of the agent, it will retry for CloudMaxRetryCount times. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version cloud_retry_backoff_sec NRIA_CLOUD_RETRY_BACKOFF_SEC integer 60 1.2.6 disable_cloud_instance_id Similar to DisableCloudMetadata, but it disables the collection of cloud metadata only for the host alias plugin. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_cloud_instance_id NRIA_DISABLE_CLOUD_INSTANCE_ID boolean false 1.0.220 disable_cloud_metadata Disables the collection of cloud metadata. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_cloud_metadata NRIA_DISABLE_CLOUD_METADATA boolean false 1.0.690 Debug variables trace Enables traces to be printed in the logs for the given features. Traces are additional log entries used for debugging purposes of specific features, they are only shown when the verbose log config option is enabled. Currently two features have traces defined: connect and attributes. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version trace NRIA_TRACE [ ]string [] 1.0.1015 Example as a YAML attribute: trace: [connect, attributes] Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_TRACE='connect, attributes' Copy Docker variables container_cache_metadata_limit Time, in seconds, before the cached containers metadata expires and the agent needs to fetch them again. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version container_cache_metadata_limit NRIA_CONTAINER_CACHE_METADATA_LIMIT integer 60 1.0.801 docker_api_version Specifies the Docker client API version. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version docker_api_version NRIA_DOCKER_API_VERSION string 1.24 1.1.4 File system variables custom_supported_file_systems List of the types of file systems that the agent supports. This value needs to be a subset of the default list, and items that are not in the default list will be discarded. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version custom_supported_file_systems NRIA_CUSTOM_SUPPORTED_FILESYSTEMS [ ]string Linux: [\"xfs\", \"btrfs\", \"ext\", \"ext2\", \"ext3\", \"ext4\", \"hfs\", \"vxfs\"] Windows: [\"NTFS\", \"ReFS\"] 1.0.220 file_devices_ignored List of storage devices to be ignored by the agent when gathering StorageSample data. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version file_devices_ignored NRIA_FILE_DEVICES_IGNORED [ ]string 1.0.220 Example as a YAML attribute: file_devices_ignored: - sda1 - sda2 Copy Example as an environment variable: FILE_DEVICES_IGNORED=\"sda1,sda2\" Copy Hostname variables display_name Overrides the auto-generated hostname for reporting. This is useful when you have multiple hosts with the same name, since our infrastructure monitoring uses the hostname as the unique identifier for each host. Keep in mind this value is also used for the loopback address replacement on entity names. For more information, see our documentation on how entity name resolution works. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version display_name NRIA_DISPLAY_NAME string empty 1.0.266 Example: display_name: teslaOne Copy dns_hostname_resolution When true, the full hostname is resolved by performing a reverse lookup of the host's address. Otherwise, it will be retrieved with the hostname command on Linux and from the TCP/IP parameters of the registry on Windows. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version dns_hostname_resolution NRIA_DNS_HOSTNAME_RESOLUTION boolean true 1.2.6 override_hostname When set, this is the value that will be reported for the full hostname; otherwise, the agent will perform the normal lookup behavior. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version override_hostname NRIA_OVERRIDE_HOSTNAME string 1.0.1015 Example: my.custom-hostname.co.org Copy override_hostname_short When set, this is the value that will be reported for the hostname; otherwise, the agent will perform the normal lookup behavior. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version override_hostname_short NRIA_OVERRIDE_HOSTNAME_SHORT string 1.0.1015 Example: my.custom-hostname Copy Installation variables agent_dir Directory where the agent stores files for cache, inventory, integrations, etc. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version agent_dir NRIA_AGENT_DIR string Linux: /var/db/newrelic-infra Windows: C:\\Program Files\\NewRelic\\newrelic-infra\\ 1.0.2 plugin_dir Directory containing the configuration files of the integrations. Each integration has its own configuration file, named by default <integration_name>-config.yml, placed in a predefined location from which the agent loads on initialization. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version plugin_dir NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR string Linux: etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/ Windows: \\Program Files\\NewRelic\\newrelic-infra\\inregrations.d 1.0.2 Important With secrets management, you can configure on-host integrations with New Relic Infrastructure's agent to use sensitive data (such as passwords) without having to write them as plain text into the integration's configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. custom_plugin_installation_dir Specifies a custom path to install integrations, which allows to install them outside the agent_dir. It has priority when the agent is looking for installed integrations. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version custom_plugin_installation_dir NRIA_CUSTOM_PLUGIN_INSTALLATION_DIR string Empty 1.0.2 Integrations variables passthrough_environment A list of environment variables that will be passed to all integrations. If an integration already has an existing configuration option with the same name, then the environment variable takes precedence. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version passthrough_environment NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT [ ]string Empty 1.0.719 Example as a YAML attribute (inside the agent's configuration file, located by default in /etc/newrelic-infra.yml): passthrough_environment: - HOST - PORT Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_PASSTHROUGH_ENVIRONMENT=\"HOST,PORT\" Copy entityname_integrations_v2_update The agent enables loopback-address replacement on the entity name (and therefore key) automatically for version 3 of the integration protocol. If you are using version 2 of the protocol and want this behavior, enable the entityname_integrations_v2_update option. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version entityname_integrations_v2_update NRIA_ENTITYNAME_INTEGRATIONS_V2_UPDATE boolean false 1.2.15 http_server_enabled By setting this configuration parameter to true the agent will open an HTTP port (by default, 8001) to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_enabled NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_ENABLED boolean false 1.0.818 http_server_host By setting this value, the agent will start listening on the HTTPServerPort to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_host NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_HOST string localhost 1.0.818 http_server_port Sets the port for the http server to receive data from the New Relic StatsD backend. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version http_server_port NRIA_HTTP_SERVER_PORT integer 8001 1.0.818 remove_entities_period Starts the process of deleting entities that haven't reported information during this interval. Valid time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), and h (hour). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version remove_entities_period NRIA_REMOVE_ENTITIES_PERIOD string 48h 1.0.859 Example: 1h Copy Inventory variables offline_time_to_reset If the cached inventory becomes older than this value (for example, because the agent is offline), the agent automatically removes and recreates the delta store. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version offline_time_to_reset NRIA_OFFLINE_TIME_TO_RESET string 24h 1.0.888 ignored_inventory The list of inventory paths ignored by the agent. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version ignored_inventory NRIA_IGNORED_INVENTORY string [ ] Empty list 1.0.336 Example as a YAML attribute: ignored_inventory: - files/config/stuff.bar - files/config/stuff.foo Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_IGNORED_INVENTORY=\"files/config/stuff.bar,files/config/stuff.foo\" Copy Linux variables pid_file Location on Linux where the pid file of the agent process is created. It is used at startup to ensure that no other instances of the agent are running. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version pid_file NRIA_PID_FILE string /var/run/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.pid 1.0.2 ignore_reclaimable When true, formulation of the host virtual memory considers SReclaimable as available memory; otherwise SReclaimable will be considered part of the used memory. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version ignore_reclaimable NRIA_IGNORE_RECLAIMABLE boolean false 1.2.6 Logging variables log_file Defines the file path for the logs. The default installation creates a log directory and it sets this filepath value in the log_file configuration option for you. This log directory is different for each OS, as shown below. Change this configuration option to customize the file path for the logs. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_file NRIA_LOG_FILE string See below * Default paths: Linux: If not defined, it logs only in the standard output. Windows, agent version 1.0.752 or lower: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.775 to 1.0.944: C:\\%APPDATA%\\Roaming\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy Windows, agent version 1.0.944 or higher: C:\\%ProgramData%\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy If the directory can't be created: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log Copy log_format Defines the log output format. Available values: text: Plain text output, one line per log entry. json: JSON-formatted output, one line per log entry. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_format NRIA_LOG_FORMAT string text 1.4.9 log_to_stdout By default all logs are displayed in both standard output and a log file. To disable logs in the standard output, set this configuration option to false. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version log_to_stdout NRIA_LOG_TO_STDOUT boolean true 1.0.703 verbose When verbose is set to 0, verbose logging is off, but the agent still creates logs. Set this to 1 to create verbose logs to use in troubleshooting the agent; set verbose to 2 to use the smart verbose mode logging. Smart verbose mode logs the last smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit debug messages when an error is logged. Setting verbose to 3 enables forwarding the agent logs to New Relic Logs. Important Verbose logging can generate a lot of data very quickly. Run the agent in verbose mode only for as long as necessary to reproduce your issue, then set verbose: 0 and restart your agent to disable verbose logging. Alternatively, you can set verbose: 2, which will enable smart verbose mode. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version verbose NRIA_VERBOSE Integer (0, 1, 2 or 3) 0 1.9.0 when using smart mode (2) 1.11.4 when forwarding the New Relic Logs (3) smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit refers to the number of previous debug messages that will be logged when an error is logged. For example, if the limit is set to 5, debug logs will be cached in memory until an error is logged, at which point the previous 5 debug messages will also be logged Important This configuration option is only used when verbose is set to 2 (Smart Verbose Mode enabled). YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version smart_verbose_mode_entry_limit NRIA_SMART_VERBOSE_MODE_ENTRY_LIMIT Integer 1000 1.9.0 Metrics variables custom_attributes Custom attributes are key-value pairs (similar to tags in other tools) used to annotate the data from the Infrastructure agent. You can use this metadata to build filter sets, group your results, and annotate your data. For example, you might indicate a machine's environment (staging or production), the service a machine hosts (login service, for example), or the team responsible for that machine. Tip The agent collects many details about your environment as part of its default attributes, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) tags. YML option name Environment variable Type custom_attributes NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES map [ string]interface { } Use a list of custom attributes to annotate the data from this agent instance. Separate keys and values with colons :, as in KEY: VALUE, and separate each key-value pair with a line break. Keys can be any valid YAML except slashes /. Values can be any YAML string, including spaces. Example as a YAML attribute: custom_attributes: environment: production service: login service team: alpha-team Copy Example as an environment variable: NRIA_CUSTOM_ATTRIBUTES='{\"customAttribute_1\":\"SOME_ATTRIBUTE\",\"customAttribute_2\": \"SOME_ATTRIBUTE_2\"}' Copy NRQL example filtering by custom attribute: FROM SystemSample SELECT * WHERE environment = 'production' Copy enable_process_metrics Important Requires infrastructure agent version 1.12.0 or higher. Accounts created before July 20, 2020 and/or infrastructure agents installed using the new Guided Install have this variable enabled by default. Enables the sending of process metrics to New Relic. By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. The agent still collects such data, unless metrics_process_sample_rate is set to -1. To report metric data about all the operating system's processes, set enable_process_metrics to true. To disable, set to false. Sending all process data could increase the volume of data sent to New Relic. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. By default, processes using low memory are excluded from being sampled. For more information, see disable-zero-mem-process-filter. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version enable_process_metrics NRIA_ENABLE_PROCESS_METRICS boolean false include_matching_metrics Important Currently, this setting only applies to an operating system's processes metrics. You can control how much data is sent to New Relic by configuring include_matching_metrics, which allows you to restrict the transmission of metric data based on the values of metric attributes. You include metric data by defining literal or partial values for any of the attributes of the metric. For example, you can choose to send the host.process.cpuPercent of all processes whose process.name match the ^java regular expression. In this example, we include process metrics using executable files and names: include_matching_metrics: # You can combine attributes from different metrics process.name: - regex “^java” # Include all processes starting with \"java\" process.executable: - “/usr/bin/python2” # Include the Python 2.x executable - regex “\\\\System32\\\\svchost” # Include all svchost executables Copy If you need to include command line arguments in any of the values, set strip_command_line to false (the infrastructure agents removes CLI arguments by default to prevent secrets from leaking). To configure include_matching_metrics as an environment variable for the Kubernetes integration, add it in the manifest inside the env: object: env: - name: NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS value: | process.name: - regex \"^java\" process.executable: - \"/usr/bin/python2\" - regex \"\\\\System32\\\\svchost\" Copy Default YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version include_matching_metrics NRIA_INCLUDE_MATCHING_METRICS metric.attribute: - regex \"pattern\" - \"string\" - \"string-with-wildcard * \" network_interface_filters You can use the network interface filters configuration to hide unused or uninteresting network interfaces from the infrastructure agent. This helps reduce resource usage, work, and noise in your data. Important Environment variables are not supported for this configuration setting. The configuration uses a simple pattern-matching mechanism that can look for interfaces that start with a specific sequence of letters or numbers following either pattern: {name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the prefix option [number]{name}[other characters], where you specify the name using the index-1 option New Relic infrastructure implements a curated default list of filters, available for both Linux and Windows, that you can modify. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version network_interface_filters not supported map [ string] [ ]string 1.0.220 Linux Default network interface filters for Linux: Network interfaces that start with dummy, lo, vmnet, sit, tun, tap, or veth Network interfaces that contain tun or tap The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with dummy or lo , or contain tun preceded by a sequence of numbers, and followed by other characters: network_interface_filters: prefix: - dummy - lo index-1: - tun Copy Windows Default network interface filters for Windows: Network interfaces that start with Loop, isatap, or Local The following example (added to your configuration file) overrides the default filters. This will ignore network interfaces that start with Loop: network_interface_filters: prefix: - Loop Copy disable_zero_mem_process_filter The ZeroRSSFilter excludes processes that are not using memory from being sampled. Disable the filter so that the agent includes these processes in the ProcessSample. YML option name Environment variable Type Default Version disable_zero_mem_process_filter NRIA_DISABLE_ZERO_MEM_PROCESS_FILTER boolean false 1.0.832 Plugins variables Tip You can quickly disable all the variables by setting DisableAllPlugins to true, and turn on only those options you need. disable_all_plugins To disable all the plugins, set this option to true.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding.

It also forwards data from infrastructure integrations to New Relic, as well as log data for log analytics. There are multiple ways to install and deploy the infrastructure monitoring agent, depending on your setup and needs. This document describes how the infrastructure monitoring agent works and how to install it. Tip To use infrastructure monitoring and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Quick start: Use our guided install The quickest way to get started with our infrastructure monitoring agent is through our guided install. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install not only installs the infrastructure agent, but also discovers the applications and log sources running in your environment. It recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your infrastructure. Important If you install the agent using the New Relic One UI, the Infrastructure status API is enabled by default. One agent, many capabilities Our infrastructure monitoring agent collects performance and health data about the system resources and processes of the host where it's enabled (on-premises or virtualized). At the same time, it acts as a forwarder for two types of data: core services metrics, which are collected by on-host integrations, and logs. If you want to collect data about core services running on your host, you need to install the infrastructure monitoring agent first, and then install or enable on-host integrations. Our infrastructure monitoring agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services. It can also forward logs to New Relic. Backend application metrics (APM) are collected by separate language agents. Notice how each integration and forwarder feed different data types in the New Relic database (NRDB). Install the infrastructure monitoring agent If our guided install doesn't work for your setup, follow the instructions for your Linux, Windows, or other setup. The infrastructure monitoring agent can currently run on many Linux distributions, as well as Windows Server. For more information on where you can run the agent, check the compatibility and requirements page. Linux The preferred way to install the Linux agent is through the package manager of your distribution. Select your distribution from the list for step-by-step instructions. Amazon Linux CentOS Container (Docker) Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Other Linux distros To use these installation links, you must be logged to your New Relic account. If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or if you prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced install needs, you can deploy the agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual mode. Windows Server and 10 To deploy the agent on a Windows Server host, install it using our MSI installer. For a guided procedure, click the button below and follow the step-by-step instructions: Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced installation needs, you can deploy the agent using our zip files in assisted or manual mode. Other installation scenarios The infrastructure monitoring agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Check the source code The infrastructure monitoring agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.

      "body": "Before installing our infrastructure agent, make sure your system and any on-host integrations you configure meet the requirements. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports these processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit for x86 processor architectures (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit for x86 processor architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible Linux operating sytems. On-host integrations are also supported (with the exception of the Oracle integration). Built-in log forwarding is not yet available. Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.10 to 1.16 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 6 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 (only the infrastructure agent is supported). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

Support for both .NET Framework and .NET Core New Relic's .NET agent supports both .NET Framework and .NET Core, and it works with all .NET compatible languages, such as VB.NET, C#, and CLI. The agent's support for .NET Core takes advantage of the compatibility, speed, expanded API features, and cross-platform capabilities of Microsoft's .NET Core. The agent does not support Microsoft .NET Core versions earlier than 2.0. With New Relic's support for .NET, you can monitor your apps in dynamic or distributed environments, such as: Cloud-managed server VM images On-host VM servers Microsoft Azure App Services Self-hosted Windows and Linux systems Amazon AWS EC2 VMs Install the agent on Windows with our guided install Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the .NET agent for Windows IIS applications. Ready to get started? Click the Guided install button. If your account reports data through our EU datacenter, click EU Guided install. Guided install EU Guided install In addition to the .NET agent, you can use this to install our infrastructure agent to discover other applications, infrastructure, and log sources running in your environment and recommend which ones should be instrumented. The install automates the configuration and deployment of each system you choose to instrument. Install the agent Before you install the .NET agent, create your New Relic account. Then, review the requirements for .NET Framework or the requirements for .NET Core. When you are ready to install, use our launcher, or see the install instructions appropriate for your operating system: Windows or Linux. Add .NET data Tip To stay up-to-date with new features and bug fixes, see the .NET agent release notes. After you install the agent and wait a few minutes for your app to generate traffic, data will appear in the APM Summary page. If no data appears, or if you encounter other problems, see New Relic's .NET agent troubleshooting procedures. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Summary: After installing the .NET agent, you will see a summary of your app's performance on the Summary page. Configure the agent The most important part of agent configuration is to give your app a descriptive name. New Relic uses this app name to aggregate metrics when you have multiple apps or hosts. The agent also includes a variety of configuration options to further customize your installation. Extend your instrumentation After installing the .NET agent, extend the agent's instrumentation with one or more of these methods: Instrumentation options Details Browser instrumentation Integrate the .NET agent with browser monitoring to gain visibility into end-user activity. ASP.NET apps (.NET Framework only): Use any of the available options to install the browser agent. ASP.NET Core apps (targeting .NET Core or .NET Framework): Use either the API method or the copy/paste method to inject the browser agent into your webpages. Custom instrumentation Instrument transactions not captured as part of New Relic's automatic framework instrumentation. Agent API See the .NET agent API guide to learn how to customize the agent's behavior. For example, you can collect custom metrics, flag an error, or ignore a particular transaction entirely. Custom attributes Customize the attributes attached to transactions. Customizing attributes allows you to avoid sending sensitive attributes, or to collect additional attributes for deeper visibility into your transactions. Distributed tracing Enable distributed tracing to understand activity across a complex, distributed system that uses many services and microservices. Open source telemetry Explore these tools: OpenTelemetry exporter and .NET Telemetry SDK. Check the source code The .NET agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent is a lightweight executable file that collects data about your hosts. It also forwards data from infrastructure integrations to New Relic, as well as log data for log analytics. There are multiple ways to install and deploy the infrastructure monitoring agent, depending on your setup and needs. This document describes how the infrastructure monitoring agent works and how to install it. Tip To use infrastructure monitoring and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Quick start: Use our guided install The quickest way to get started with our infrastructure monitoring agent is through our guided install. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install not only installs the infrastructure agent, but also discovers the applications and log sources running in your environment. It recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your infrastructure. Important If you install the agent using the New Relic One UI, the Infrastructure status API is enabled by default. One agent, many capabilities Our infrastructure monitoring agent collects performance and health data about the system resources and processes of the host where it's enabled (on-premises or virtualized). At the same time, it acts as a forwarder for two types of data: core services metrics, which are collected by on-host integrations, and logs. If you want to collect data about core services running on your host, you need to install the infrastructure monitoring agent first, and then install or enable on-host integrations. Our infrastructure monitoring agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services. It can also forward logs to New Relic. Backend application metrics (APM) are collected by separate language agents. Notice how each integration and forwarder feed different data types in the New Relic database (NRDB). Install the infrastructure monitoring agent If our guided install doesn't work for your setup, follow the instructions for your Linux, Windows, or other setup. The infrastructure monitoring agent can currently run on many Linux distributions, as well as Windows Server. For more information on where you can run the agent, check the compatibility and requirements page. Linux The preferred way to install the Linux agent is through the package manager of your distribution. Select your distribution from the list for step-by-step instructions. Amazon Linux CentOS Container (Docker) Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Other Linux distros To use these installation links, you must be logged to your New Relic account. If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or if you prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced install needs, you can deploy the agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual mode. Windows Server and 10 To deploy the agent on a Windows Server host, install it using our MSI installer. For a guided procedure, click the button below and follow the step-by-step instructions: Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced installation needs, you can deploy the agent using our zip files in assisted or manual mode. Other installation scenarios The infrastructure monitoring agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Check the source code The infrastructure monitoring agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding.

      "body": "New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent is a lightweight executable file that collects data about your hosts. It also forwards data from infrastructure integrations to New Relic, as well as log data for log analytics. There are multiple ways to install and deploy the infrastructure monitoring agent, depending on your setup and needs. This document describes how the infrastructure monitoring agent works and how to install it. Tip To use infrastructure monitoring and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Quick start: Use our guided install The quickest way to get started with our infrastructure monitoring agent is through our guided install. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install not only installs the infrastructure agent, but also discovers the applications and log sources running in your environment. It recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your infrastructure. Important If you install the agent using the New Relic One UI, the Infrastructure status API is enabled by default. One agent, many capabilities Our infrastructure monitoring agent collects performance and health data about the system resources and processes of the host where it's enabled (on-premises or virtualized). At the same time, it acts as a forwarder for two types of data: core services metrics, which are collected by on-host integrations, and logs. If you want to collect data about core services running on your host, you need to install the infrastructure monitoring agent first, and then install or enable on-host integrations. Our infrastructure monitoring agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services. It can also forward logs to New Relic. Backend application metrics (APM) are collected by separate language agents. Notice how each integration and forwarder feed different data types in the New Relic database (NRDB). Install the infrastructure monitoring agent If our guided install doesn't work for your setup, follow the instructions for your Linux, Windows, or other setup. The infrastructure monitoring agent can currently run on many Linux distributions, as well as Windows Server. For more information on where you can run the agent, check the compatibility and requirements page. Linux The preferred way to install the Linux agent is through the package manager of your distribution. Select your distribution from the list for step-by-step instructions. Amazon Linux CentOS Container (Docker) Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Other Linux distros To use these installation links, you must be logged to your New Relic account. If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or if you prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced install needs, you can deploy the agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual mode. Windows Server and 10 To deploy the agent on a Windows Server host, install it using our MSI installer. For a guided procedure, click the button below and follow the step-by-step instructions: Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced installation needs, you can deploy the agent using our zip files in assisted or manual mode. Other installation scenarios The infrastructure monitoring agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Check the source code The infrastructure monitoring agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.

      "body": "Our custom Linux installation process for infrastructure monitoring allows you to tailor all aspects of the installation process, and to place files and folders on your filesystem. You have full control of the installation. Caution The manual install process is not supervised. If you opt for manual install, you are responsible for placing the different files in the correct folders, providing the correct parameterized configuration values, and ensuring the agent has all the permissions to execute. Install the agent Before installation, check the compatibility and requirements. Additional agent package options Comments Troubleshooting As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend that you add it in your path. Daemon process As of version 1.5.59, the infrastructure agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-service binary, which is used to safely manage usual agent daemon process newrelic-infra. To install the agent: Download the packaged agent file. Unpack the file. Make sure the file unpacks with the following structure: newrelic-infra |-- config_defaults.sh |-- etc | |-- init_scripts | | |-- systemd | | | `-- newrelic-infra.service | | |-- sysv | | | `-- newrelic-infra | | `-- upstart | | `-- newrelic-infra | `-- newrelic-infra | `-- integrations.d |-- installer.sh |-- usr | `-- bin | |-- newrelic-infra | |-- newrelic-infra-ctl | `-- newrelic-infra-service `-- var |-- db | `-- newrelic-infra | |-- custom-integrations | |-- integrations.d | |-- LICENSE.txt | `-- newrelic-integrations |-- log | `-- newrelic-infra `-- run `-- newrelic-infra Copy Install the service script. Optional: Additional install steps. Install: Optional steps You can also carry out these additional steps: Change the location of the configuration file. Change the location of the PID file. Change the user and runtime mode. Configure the plugin directory. Configure the agent directory. Configure the log file. Change the location of the agent binary. Install the service script Before you proceed to install the service script, you need to determine which service manager your system is using: If you use one of the supported service managers (SystemD, SysV, and Upstart), use the service script provided in the tarball. If you use a service manager we do not support, you must write your own service script. Important In case of doubt, check your Linux distribution's official documentation. Determine your service manager There's no good way you can programmatically know which service manager is being used in your host, but we can give you some heuristics. To determine the service manager, use the following commands: command -v systemctl (used in Systemd) command -v update-rc.d (used in SysV) command -v initctl (used in Upstart) The first command that returns an output indicates which service manager your system uses. Tip For example, run the following sequence: $ command -v systemctl $ command -v initctl /sbin/initctl Copy Based on this output, Upstart is the service manager, since it's the command that obtained a return. Important Before copying the service manager script, check if you need to change the user, the path of the agent’s binary, or the pid file location. All these changes need to be reflected in the service script. If you use one of the supported service managers, install the service script for your host: Systemd Copy the service file ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/systemd/newrelic-infra.service to /etc/systemd/system/newrelic-infra.service Enable the service script: systemctl enable newrelic-infra.service Copy SysV Copy the service file ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/sysv/newrelic-infra to /etc/init.d/system/newrelic-infra Run the following commands: update-rc.d newrelic-infra defaults update-rc.d newrelic-infra enable Copy Upstart Copy the service file ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/upstart/newrelic-infra to /etc/init/newrelic-infra.conf Run the following command: initctl reload-configuration Copy Your service script is configured. Configure the rest of the options and start the service manually. Change config file's location The infrastructure agent includes a configuration file, usually named newrelic-infra.yml, to fine-tune the agent's behavior. For more information, see a config file template and how to configure the agent. By default, the agent searches for the configuration file in one of these locations: newrelic-infra.yml (working directory root folder) /etc/newrelic-infra.yml /etc/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.yml To specify a different location, use the -config flag command-line. For example: usr/bin/newrelic-infra -config /whatever/path/custom_config_name.yml Copy To make this change permanent, edit the service script: Systemd Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/systemd/newrelic-infra.service. Search for the line ExecStart=/usr/bin/newrelic-infra. Add the config flag and the config file path. In this example the config file is located in the /opt directory ExecStart=/usr/bin/newrelic-infra -config /opt/config.yaml. Save the file. SysV Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/sysv/newrelic-infra. Search for the line DAEMON=/usr/bin/$NAME”. Below the DAEMON variable, add this new line: EXTRA_OPTS=\"-config config_file\" (with the quotation marks). Replace config_file with the path to the config file you want to use. Save the file. Upstart Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/upstart/newrelic-infra. Search for the line exec /usr/bin/newrelic-infra. Add the config flag and the config file path. Here the config file is located in the /opt directory exec /usr/bin/newrelic-infra -config /opt/config.yaml. Save the file. Change the pid-file location The infrastructure agent uses a pid-file to keep the process identification number (pid), which is used to identify a running instance of the agent. How to change the location of the pid-file depends on how the agent is configured. Important By default, we recommend that the agent creates the pid-file. You can edit the location if necessary. To change the location of the pid-file: If the agent creates the pid-file On startup, the agent writes its process pid into the pid-file. If the file doesn’t exist it will create it. By default, the agent creates the pid-file using the path /var/run/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.pid. To modify it, use one of these options: Add the pid_file configuration option in the configuration file newrelic-infra.yml. Provide the pid_file using the command line when running the newrelic-infra binary. Set the NRIA_PID_FILE environment variable. Important Since the agent creates or updates the pid-file every time it’s initialized, the user who runs the agent must have read/write permissions over the pid-file location. Use the chown command to give owner rights to a user. For example, if the user nri-agent is running the agent and the pid-file location is set to/var/run/newrelic-infra-custom/nr.pid, then you can give the user rights with: chown nri-agent:nri-agent /var/run/newrelic-infra-custom/ Copy If the agent uses the PIDFILE environment variable Caution We do not recommend using the PIDFILE environment variable to manage the pid-file. If the environment variable PIDFILE is set, the agent will not try to create the pid-file. Create the pid-file in a location of your choice. Tip Use this approach if someone else takes care of the pid-file lifecycle. For example, our init script sets the PIDFILE variable for some service managers, such as SysV, because they handle the creation and content of the pid-file. Change the user and runtime mode The Linux agent runs as root by default, but it also supports running with users with less privileges: PRIVILEGED and UNPRIVILEGED. For more information, see our documentation on agent running modes. Important To execute the agent as a non-root user (PRIVILEGED or UNPRIVILEGED), make sure to grant read/write access to the folders and files provided in the tarball. To change the running mode: Edit the service script: Systemd Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/systemd/newrelic-infra.service. Search for the line [Service]. Add the line User=user_name, and replace user_name with the user that you want to execute the agent (PRIVILEGED or UNPRIVILEGED). Save the file. SysV Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/sysv/newrelic-infra. Search for the line USER=root. Replace root with the user that you want to execute the agent (PRIVILEGED or UNPRIVILEGED). Save the file. Upstart Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/upstart/newrelic-infra. Search for the line exec /usr/bin/newrelic-infra. Replace it with exec su -s /bin/sh -c ‘exec “$0” “$@“’ user_name-- /usr/bin/newrelic-infra. Replace user_name with the user that you want to execute the agent (PRIVILEGED or UNPRIVILEGED). Save the file. If you're running the agent as PRIVILEGED, you must give it two additional Linux capabilities: Make sure the libcap library is installed in your host. (You need the setcap and getcap commands that come with it.) Extract the contents of the tarball and execute the following command with root permission: setcap CAP_SYS_PTRACE,CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH=+ep ./newrelic-infra/usr/bin/newrelic-infra Copy The run mode will be selected based on the current user and the Kernel Capabilities assigned to it. Configure the plugin directory The infrastructure agent allows you to install integrations that monitor and report data from popular services such as Kubernetes, AWS, MySQL, Redis, Kafka, etc. Each integration has its own configuration file, named by default integration-name-config.yml, placed in the predefined location /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/. On initialization, the agent loads the config file. To overwrite the predefined location of the integration configuration file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the plugin_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -plugin_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the agent directory The agent requires its own defined directory to run the installed integrations, caching data (inventory), etc. The default location is /var/db/newrelic-infra/. The agent directory has the following structure and content: LICENSE: Text file containing the New Relic Infrastructure agent license. custom-integrations: Directory that stores the installed the custom integrations. newrelic-integrations: Directory that stores the New Relic official integrations. data: Directory where the agent stores cache data (inventory). Important The user running the agent must have read/write permissions to the agent directory. To overwrite the predefined location of the agent directory, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_AGENT_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the agent_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -agent_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the log file By default the agent stores the log files in /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.log. Important The user running the agent must have write permissions on the log file. To overwrite the predefined location of the log file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_LOG_FILE environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the log_file field. Pass it as a command line argument using -log_file when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Change the location of the agent binary To change the location of the executable, edit the service script: Systemd Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/systemd/newrelic-infra.service. Search for the line [ExecStart=/usr/bin/newrelic-infra]. Replace the path. Save the file. SysV Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/sysv/newrelic-infra. Search for the line DAEMON=/usr/bin/$NAME. Replace the path. Save the file. Upstart Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/upstart/newrelic-infra. Search for the line exec /usr/bin/newrelic-infra. Replace the path. Save the file. What's next? You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures.

      "body": "New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent is a lightweight executable file that collects data about your hosts. It also forwards data from infrastructure integrations to New Relic, as well as log data for log analytics. There are multiple ways to install and deploy the infrastructure monitoring agent, depending on your setup and needs. This document describes how the infrastructure monitoring agent works and how to install it. Tip To use infrastructure monitoring and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Quick start: Use our guided install The quickest way to get started with our infrastructure monitoring agent is through our guided install. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install not only installs the infrastructure agent, but also discovers the applications and log sources running in your environment. It recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your infrastructure. Important If you install the agent using the New Relic One UI, the Infrastructure status API is enabled by default. One agent, many capabilities Our infrastructure monitoring agent collects performance and health data about the system resources and processes of the host where it's enabled (on-premises or virtualized). At the same time, it acts as a forwarder for two types of data: core services metrics, which are collected by on-host integrations, and logs. If you want to collect data about core services running on your host, you need to install the infrastructure monitoring agent first, and then install or enable on-host integrations. Our infrastructure monitoring agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services. It can also forward logs to New Relic. Backend application metrics (APM) are collected by separate language agents. Notice how each integration and forwarder feed different data types in the New Relic database (NRDB). Install the infrastructure monitoring agent If our guided install doesn't work for your setup, follow the instructions for your Linux, Windows, or other setup. The infrastructure monitoring agent can currently run on many Linux distributions, as well as Windows Server. For more information on where you can run the agent, check the compatibility and requirements page. Linux The preferred way to install the Linux agent is through the package manager of your distribution. Select your distribution from the list for step-by-step instructions. Amazon Linux CentOS Container (Docker) Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Other Linux distros To use these installation links, you must be logged to your New Relic account. If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or if you prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced install needs, you can deploy the agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual mode. Windows Server and 10 To deploy the agent on a Windows Server host, install it using our MSI installer. For a guided procedure, click the button below and follow the step-by-step instructions: Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced installation needs, you can deploy the agent using our zip files in assisted or manual mode. Other installation scenarios The infrastructure monitoring agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Check the source code The infrastructure monitoring agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.

You have full control of the installation. Caution The manual install process is not supervised. If you opt for manual install, you are responsible for placing the different files in the correct folders, providing the correct parameterized configuration values, and ensuring the agent has all the permissions to execute. Install the agent Before installation, check the compatibility and requirements. Additional agent package options Comments Troubleshooting As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend that you add it in your path. Daemon process As of version 1.5.59, the infrastructure agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-service binary, which is used to safely manage usual agent daemon process newrelic-infra. To install the agent: Download the packaged agent file. Unpack the file. Make sure the file unpacks with the following structure: newrelic-infra |-- config_defaults.sh |-- etc | |-- init_scripts | | |-- systemd | | | `-- newrelic-infra.service | | |-- sysv | | | `-- newrelic-infra | | `-- upstart | | `-- newrelic-infra | `-- newrelic-infra | `-- integrations.d |-- installer.sh |-- usr | `-- bin | |-- newrelic-infra | |-- newrelic-infra-ctl | `-- newrelic-infra-service `-- var |-- db | `-- newrelic-infra | |-- custom-integrations | |-- integrations.d | |-- LICENSE.txt | `-- newrelic-integrations |-- log | `-- newrelic-infra `-- run `-- newrelic-infra Copy Install the service script. Optional: Additional install steps. Install: Optional steps You can also carry out these additional steps: Change the location of the configuration file. Change the location of the PID file. Change the user and runtime mode. Configure the plugin directory. Configure the agent directory. Configure the log file. Change the location of the agent binary. Install the service script Before you proceed to install the service script, you need to determine which service manager your system is using: If you use one of the supported service managers (SystemD, SysV, and Upstart), use the service script provided in the tarball. If you use a service manager we do not support, you must write your own service script. Important In case of doubt, check your Linux distribution's official documentation. Determine your service manager There's no good way you can programmatically know which service manager is being used in your host, but we can give you some heuristics. To determine the service manager, use the following commands: command -v systemctl (used in Systemd) command -v update-rc.d (used in SysV) command -v initctl (used in Upstart) The first command that returns an output indicates which service manager your system uses. Tip For example, run the following sequence: $ command -v systemctl $ command -v initctl /sbin/initctl Copy Based on this output, Upstart is the service manager, since it's the command that obtained a return. Important Before copying the service manager script, check if you need to change the user, the path of the agent’s binary, or the pid file location. All these changes need to be reflected in the service script. If you use one of the supported service managers, install the service script for your host: Systemd Copy the service file ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/systemd/newrelic-infra.service to /etc/systemd/system/newrelic-infra.service Enable the service script: systemctl enable newrelic-infra.service Copy SysV Copy the service file ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/sysv/newrelic-infra to /etc/init.d/system/newrelic-infra Run the following commands: update-rc.d newrelic-infra defaults update-rc.d newrelic-infra enable Copy Upstart Copy the service file ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/upstart/newrelic-infra to /etc/init/newrelic-infra.conf Run the following command: initctl reload-configuration Copy Your service script is configured. Configure the rest of the options and start the service manually. Change config file's location The infrastructure agent includes a configuration file, usually named newrelic-infra.yml, to fine-tune the agent's behavior. For more information, see a config file template and how to configure the agent. By default, the agent searches for the configuration file in one of these locations: newrelic-infra.yml (working directory root folder) /etc/newrelic-infra.yml /etc/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.yml To specify a different location, use the -config flag command-line. For example: usr/bin/newrelic-infra -config /whatever/path/custom_config_name.yml Copy To make this change permanent, edit the service script: Systemd Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/systemd/newrelic-infra.service. Search for the line ExecStart=/usr/bin/newrelic-infra. Add the config flag and the config file path. In this example the config file is located in the /opt directory ExecStart=/usr/bin/newrelic-infra -config /opt/config.yaml. Save the file. SysV Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/sysv/newrelic-infra. Search for the line DAEMON=/usr/bin/$NAME”. Below the DAEMON variable, add this new line: EXTRA_OPTS=\"-config config_file\" (with the quotation marks). Replace config_file with the path to the config file you want to use. Save the file. Upstart Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/upstart/newrelic-infra. Search for the line exec /usr/bin/newrelic-infra. Add the config flag and the config file path. Here the config file is located in the /opt directory exec /usr/bin/newrelic-infra -config /opt/config.yaml. Save the file. Change the pid-file location The infrastructure agent uses a pid-file to keep the process identification number (pid), which is used to identify a running instance of the agent. How to change the location of the pid-file depends on how the agent is configured. Important By default, we recommend that the agent creates the pid-file. You can edit the location if necessary. To change the location of the pid-file: If the agent creates the pid-file On startup, the agent writes its process pid into the pid-file. If the file doesn’t exist it will create it. By default, the agent creates the pid-file using the path /var/run/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.pid. To modify it, use one of these options: Add the pid_file configuration option in the configuration file newrelic-infra.yml. Provide the pid_file using the command line when running the newrelic-infra binary. Set the NRIA_PID_FILE environment variable. Important Since the agent creates or updates the pid-file every time it’s initialized, the user who runs the agent must have read/write permissions over the pid-file location. Use the chown command to give owner rights to a user. For example, if the user nri-agent is running the agent and the pid-file location is set to/var/run/newrelic-infra-custom/nr.pid, then you can give the user rights with: chown nri-agent:nri-agent /var/run/newrelic-infra-custom/ Copy If the agent uses the PIDFILE environment variable Caution We do not recommend using the PIDFILE environment variable to manage the pid-file. If the environment variable PIDFILE is set, the agent will not try to create the pid-file. Create the pid-file in a location of your choice. Tip Use this approach if someone else takes care of the pid-file lifecycle. For example, our init script sets the PIDFILE variable for some service managers, such as SysV, because they handle the creation and content of the pid-file. Change the user and runtime mode The Linux agent runs as root by default, but it also supports running with users with less privileges: PRIVILEGED and UNPRIVILEGED. For more information, see our documentation on agent running modes. Important To execute the agent as a non-root user (PRIVILEGED or UNPRIVILEGED), make sure to grant read/write access to the folders and files provided in the tarball. To change the running mode: Edit the service script: Systemd Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/systemd/newrelic-infra.service. Search for the line [Service]. Add the line User=user_name, and replace user_name with the user that you want to execute the agent (PRIVILEGED or UNPRIVILEGED). Save the file. SysV Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/sysv/newrelic-infra. Search for the line USER=root. Replace root with the user that you want to execute the agent (PRIVILEGED or UNPRIVILEGED). Save the file. Upstart Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/upstart/newrelic-infra. Search for the line exec /usr/bin/newrelic-infra. Replace it with exec su -s /bin/sh -c ‘exec “$0” “$@“’ user_name-- /usr/bin/newrelic-infra. Replace user_name with the user that you want to execute the agent (PRIVILEGED or UNPRIVILEGED). Save the file. If you're running the agent as PRIVILEGED, you must give it two additional Linux capabilities: Make sure the libcap library is installed in your host. (You need the setcap and getcap commands that come with it.) Extract the contents of the tarball and execute the following command with root permission: setcap CAP_SYS_PTRACE,CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH=+ep ./newrelic-infra/usr/bin/newrelic-infra Copy The run mode will be selected based on the current user and the Kernel Capabilities assigned to it. Configure the plugin directory The infrastructure agent allows you to install integrations that monitor and report data from popular services such as Kubernetes, AWS, MySQL, Redis, Kafka, etc. Each integration has its own configuration file, named by default integration-name-config.yml, placed in the predefined location /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/. On initialization, the agent loads the config file. To overwrite the predefined location of the integration configuration file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the plugin_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -plugin_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the agent directory The agent requires its own defined directory to run the installed integrations, caching data (inventory), etc. The default location is /var/db/newrelic-infra/. The agent directory has the following structure and content: LICENSE: Text file containing the New Relic Infrastructure agent license. custom-integrations: Directory that stores the installed the custom integrations. newrelic-integrations: Directory that stores the New Relic official integrations. data: Directory where the agent stores cache data (inventory). Important The user running the agent must have read/write permissions to the agent directory. To overwrite the predefined location of the agent directory, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_AGENT_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the agent_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -agent_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the log file By default the agent stores the log files in /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.log. Important The user running the agent must have write permissions on the log file. To overwrite the predefined location of the log file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_LOG_FILE environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the log_file field. Pass it as a command line argument using -log_file when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Change the location of the agent binary To change the location of the executable, edit the service script: Systemd Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/systemd/newrelic-infra.service. Search for the line [ExecStart=/usr/bin/newrelic-infra]. Replace the path. Save the file. SysV Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/sysv/newrelic-infra. Search for the line DAEMON=/usr/bin/$NAME. Replace the path. Save the file. Upstart Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/upstart/newrelic-infra. Search for the line exec /usr/bin/newrelic-infra. Replace the path. Save the file. What's next? You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data.

Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install not only installs the infrastructure agent, but also discovers the applications and log sources running in your environment. It recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your infrastructure. Important If you install the agent using the New Relic One UI, the Infrastructure status API is enabled by default. One agent, many capabilities Our infrastructure monitoring agent collects performance and health data about the system resources and processes of the host where it's enabled (on-premises or virtualized). At the same time, it acts as a forwarder for two types of data: core services metrics, which are collected by on-host integrations, and logs. If you want to collect data about core services running on your host, you need to install the infrastructure monitoring agent first, and then install or enable on-host integrations. Our infrastructure monitoring agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services. It can also forward logs to New Relic. Backend application metrics (APM) are collected by separate language agents. Notice how each integration and forwarder feed different data types in the New Relic database (NRDB). Install the infrastructure monitoring agent If our guided install doesn't work for your setup, follow the instructions for your Linux, Windows, or other setup. The infrastructure monitoring agent can currently run on many Linux distributions, as well as Windows Server. For more information on where you can run the agent, check the compatibility and requirements page. Linux The preferred way to install the Linux agent is through the package manager of your distribution. Select your distribution from the list for step-by-step instructions. Amazon Linux CentOS Container (Docker) Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Other Linux distros To use these installation links, you must be logged to your New Relic account. If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or if you prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced install needs, you can deploy the agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual mode. Windows Server and 10 To deploy the agent on a Windows Server host, install it using our MSI installer.

You have full control of the installation. Caution The manual install process is not supervised. If you opt for manual install, you are responsible for placing the different files in the correct folders, providing the correct parameterized configuration values, and ensuring the agent has all the permissions to execute. Install the agent Before installation, check the compatibility and requirements. Additional agent package options Comments Troubleshooting As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend that you add it in your path. Daemon process As of version 1.5.59, the infrastructure agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-service binary, which is used to safely manage usual agent daemon process newrelic-infra. To install the agent: Download the packaged agent file. Unpack the file. Make sure the file unpacks with the following structure: newrelic-infra |-- config_defaults.sh |-- etc | |-- init_scripts | | |-- systemd | | | `-- newrelic-infra.service | | |-- sysv | | | `-- newrelic-infra | | `-- upstart | | `-- newrelic-infra | `-- newrelic-infra | `-- integrations.d |-- installer.sh |-- usr | `-- bin | |-- newrelic-infra | |-- newrelic-infra-ctl | `-- newrelic-infra-service `-- var |-- db | `-- newrelic-infra | |-- custom-integrations | |-- integrations.d | |-- LICENSE.txt | `-- newrelic-integrations |-- log | `-- newrelic-infra `-- run `-- newrelic-infra Copy Install the service script. Optional: Additional install steps. Install: Optional steps You can also carry out these additional steps: Change the location of the configuration file. Change the location of the PID file. Change the user and runtime mode. Configure the plugin directory. Configure the agent directory. Configure the log file. Change the location of the agent binary. Install the service script Before you proceed to install the service script, you need to determine which service manager your system is using: If you use one of the supported service managers (SystemD, SysV, and Upstart), use the service script provided in the tarball. If you use a service manager we do not support, you must write your own service script. Important In case of doubt, check your Linux distribution's official documentation. Determine your service manager There's no good way you can programmatically know which service manager is being used in your host, but we can give you some heuristics. To determine the service manager, use the following commands: command -v systemctl (used in Systemd) command -v update-rc.d (used in SysV) command -v initctl (used in Upstart) The first command that returns an output indicates which service manager your system uses. Tip For example, run the following sequence: $ command -v systemctl $ command -v initctl /sbin/initctl Copy Based on this output, Upstart is the service manager, since it's the command that obtained a return. Important Before copying the service manager script, check if you need to change the user, the path of the agent’s binary, or the pid file location. All these changes need to be reflected in the service script. If you use one of the supported service managers, install the service script for your host: Systemd Copy the service file ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/systemd/newrelic-infra.service to /etc/systemd/system/newrelic-infra.service Enable the service script: systemctl enable newrelic-infra.service Copy SysV Copy the service file ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/sysv/newrelic-infra to /etc/init.d/system/newrelic-infra Run the following commands: update-rc.d newrelic-infra defaults update-rc.d newrelic-infra enable Copy Upstart Copy the service file ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/upstart/newrelic-infra to /etc/init/newrelic-infra.conf Run the following command: initctl reload-configuration Copy Your service script is configured. Configure the rest of the options and start the service manually. Change config file's location The infrastructure agent includes a configuration file, usually named newrelic-infra.yml, to fine-tune the agent's behavior. For more information, see a config file template and how to configure the agent. By default, the agent searches for the configuration file in one of these locations: newrelic-infra.yml (working directory root folder) /etc/newrelic-infra.yml /etc/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.yml To specify a different location, use the -config flag command-line. For example: usr/bin/newrelic-infra -config /whatever/path/custom_config_name.yml Copy To make this change permanent, edit the service script: Systemd Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/systemd/newrelic-infra.service. Search for the line ExecStart=/usr/bin/newrelic-infra. Add the config flag and the config file path. In this example the config file is located in the /opt directory ExecStart=/usr/bin/newrelic-infra -config /opt/config.yaml. Save the file. SysV Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/sysv/newrelic-infra. Search for the line DAEMON=/usr/bin/$NAME”. Below the DAEMON variable, add this new line: EXTRA_OPTS=\"-config config_file\" (with the quotation marks). Replace config_file with the path to the config file you want to use. Save the file. Upstart Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/upstart/newrelic-infra. Search for the line exec /usr/bin/newrelic-infra. Add the config flag and the config file path. Here the config file is located in the /opt directory exec /usr/bin/newrelic-infra -config /opt/config.yaml. Save the file. Change the pid-file location The infrastructure agent uses a pid-file to keep the process identification number (pid), which is used to identify a running instance of the agent. How to change the location of the pid-file depends on how the agent is configured. Important By default, we recommend that the agent creates the pid-file. You can edit the location if necessary. To change the location of the pid-file: If the agent creates the pid-file On startup, the agent writes its process pid into the pid-file. If the file doesn’t exist it will create it. By default, the agent creates the pid-file using the path /var/run/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.pid. To modify it, use one of these options: Add the pid_file configuration option in the configuration file newrelic-infra.yml. Provide the pid_file using the command line when running the newrelic-infra binary. Set the NRIA_PID_FILE environment variable. Important Since the agent creates or updates the pid-file every time it’s initialized, the user who runs the agent must have read/write permissions over the pid-file location. Use the chown command to give owner rights to a user. For example, if the user nri-agent is running the agent and the pid-file location is set to/var/run/newrelic-infra-custom/nr.pid, then you can give the user rights with: chown nri-agent:nri-agent /var/run/newrelic-infra-custom/ Copy If the agent uses the PIDFILE environment variable Caution We do not recommend using the PIDFILE environment variable to manage the pid-file. If the environment variable PIDFILE is set, the agent will not try to create the pid-file. Create the pid-file in a location of your choice. Tip Use this approach if someone else takes care of the pid-file lifecycle. For example, our init script sets the PIDFILE variable for some service managers, such as SysV, because they handle the creation and content of the pid-file. Change the user and runtime mode The Linux agent runs as root by default, but it also supports running with users with less privileges: PRIVILEGED and UNPRIVILEGED. For more information, see our documentation on agent running modes. Important To execute the agent as a non-root user (PRIVILEGED or UNPRIVILEGED), make sure to grant read/write access to the folders and files provided in the tarball. To change the running mode: Edit the service script: Systemd Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/systemd/newrelic-infra.service. Search for the line [Service]. Add the line User=user_name, and replace user_name with the user that you want to execute the agent (PRIVILEGED or UNPRIVILEGED). Save the file. SysV Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/sysv/newrelic-infra. Search for the line USER=root. Replace root with the user that you want to execute the agent (PRIVILEGED or UNPRIVILEGED). Save the file. Upstart Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/upstart/newrelic-infra. Search for the line exec /usr/bin/newrelic-infra. Replace it with exec su -s /bin/sh -c ‘exec “$0” “$@“’ user_name-- /usr/bin/newrelic-infra. Replace user_name with the user that you want to execute the agent (PRIVILEGED or UNPRIVILEGED). Save the file. If you're running the agent as PRIVILEGED, you must give it two additional Linux capabilities: Make sure the libcap library is installed in your host. (You need the setcap and getcap commands that come with it.) Extract the contents of the tarball and execute the following command with root permission: setcap CAP_SYS_PTRACE,CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH=+ep ./newrelic-infra/usr/bin/newrelic-infra Copy The run mode will be selected based on the current user and the Kernel Capabilities assigned to it. Configure the plugin directory The infrastructure agent allows you to install integrations that monitor and report data from popular services such as Kubernetes, AWS, MySQL, Redis, Kafka, etc. Each integration has its own configuration file, named by default integration-name-config.yml, placed in the predefined location /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/. On initialization, the agent loads the config file. To overwrite the predefined location of the integration configuration file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the plugin_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -plugin_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the agent directory The agent requires its own defined directory to run the installed integrations, caching data (inventory), etc. The default location is /var/db/newrelic-infra/. The agent directory has the following structure and content: LICENSE: Text file containing the New Relic Infrastructure agent license. custom-integrations: Directory that stores the installed the custom integrations. newrelic-integrations: Directory that stores the New Relic official integrations. data: Directory where the agent stores cache data (inventory). Important The user running the agent must have read/write permissions to the agent directory. To overwrite the predefined location of the agent directory, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_AGENT_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the agent_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -agent_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the log file By default the agent stores the log files in /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.log. Important The user running the agent must have write permissions on the log file. To overwrite the predefined location of the log file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_LOG_FILE environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the log_file field. Pass it as a command line argument using -log_file when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Change the location of the agent binary To change the location of the executable, edit the service script: Systemd Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/systemd/newrelic-infra.service. Search for the line [ExecStart=/usr/bin/newrelic-infra]. Replace the path. Save the file. SysV Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/sysv/newrelic-infra. Search for the line DAEMON=/usr/bin/$NAME. Replace the path. Save the file. Upstart Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/upstart/newrelic-infra. Search for the line exec /usr/bin/newrelic-infra. Replace the path. Save the file. What's next? You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data.

Make sure the file unpacks with the following structure: newrelic-infra |-- config_defaults.sh |-- etc | |-- init_scripts | | |-- systemd | | | `-- newrelic-infra.service | | |-- sysv | | | `-- newrelic-infra | | `-- upstart | | `-- newrelic-infra | `-- newrelic-infra | `-- integrations.d |-- installer.sh |-- usr | `-- bin | |-- newrelic-infra | |-- newrelic-infra-ctl | `-- newrelic-infra-service `-- var |-- db | `-- newrelic-infra | |-- custom-integrations | |-- integrations.d | |-- LICENSE.txt | `-- newrelic-integrations |-- log | `-- newrelic-infra `-- run `-- newrelic-infra Copy Install the service script. Optional: Additional install steps. Install: Optional steps You can also carry out these additional steps: Change the location of the configuration file. Change the location of the PID file. Change the user and runtime mode. Configure the plugin directory. Configure the agent directory. Configure the log file. Change the location of the agent binary. Install the service script Before you proceed to install the service script, you need to determine which service manager your system is using: If you use one of the supported service managers (SystemD, SysV, and Upstart), use the service script provided in the tarball. If you use a service manager we do not support, you must write your own service script. Important In case of doubt, check your Linux distribution's official documentation. Determine your service manager There's no good way you can programmatically know which service manager is being used in your host, but we can give you some heuristics. To determine the service manager, use the following commands: command -v systemctl (used in Systemd) command -v update-rc.d (used in SysV) command -v initctl (used in Upstart) The first command that returns an output indicates which service manager your system uses. Tip For example, run the following sequence: $ command -v systemctl $ command -v initctl /sbin/initctl Copy Based on this output, Upstart is the service manager, since it's the command that obtained a return. Important Before copying the service manager script, check if you need to change the user, the path of the agent’s binary, or the pid file location. All these changes need to be reflected in the service script. If you use one of the supported service managers, install the service script for your host: Systemd Copy the service file ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/systemd/newrelic-infra.service to /etc/systemd/system/newrelic-infra.service Enable the service script: systemctl enable newrelic-infra.service Copy SysV Copy the service file ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/sysv/newrelic-infra to /etc/init.d/system/newrelic-infra Run the following commands: update-rc.d newrelic-infra defaults update-rc.d newrelic-infra enable Copy Upstart Copy the service file ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/upstart/newrelic-infra to /etc/init/newrelic-infra.conf Run the following command: initctl reload-configuration Copy Your service script is configured. Configure the rest of the options and start the service manually. Change config file's location The infrastructure agent includes a configuration file, usually named newrelic-infra.yml, to fine-tune the agent's behavior. For more information, see a config file template and how to configure the agent. By default, the agent searches for the configuration file in one of these locations: newrelic-infra.yml (working directory root folder) /etc/newrelic-infra.yml /etc/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.yml To specify a different location, use the -config flag command-line. For example: usr/bin/newrelic-infra -config /whatever/path/custom_config_name.yml Copy To make this change permanent, edit the service script: Systemd Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/systemd/newrelic-infra.service. Search for the line ExecStart=/usr/bin/newrelic-infra. Add the config flag and the config file path. In this example the config file is located in the /opt directory ExecStart=/usr/bin/newrelic-infra -config /opt/config.yaml. Save the file. SysV Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/sysv/newrelic-infra. Search for the line DAEMON=/usr/bin/$NAME”. Below the DAEMON variable, add this new line: EXTRA_OPTS=\"-config config_file\" (with the quotation marks). Replace config_file with the path to the config file you want to use. Save the file. Upstart Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/upstart/newrelic-infra. Search for the line exec /usr/bin/newrelic-infra. Add the config flag and the config file path. Here the config file is located in the /opt directory exec /usr/bin/newrelic-infra -config /opt/config.yaml. Save the file. Change the pid-file location The infrastructure agent uses a pid-file to keep the process identification number (pid), which is used to identify a running instance of the agent. How to change the location of the pid-file depends on how the agent is configured. Important By default, we recommend that the agent creates the pid-file. You can edit the location if necessary. To change the location of the pid-file: If the agent creates the pid-file On startup, the agent writes its process pid into the pid-file. If the file doesn’t exist it will create it. By default, the agent creates the pid-file using the path /var/run/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.pid. To modify it, use one of these options: Add the pid_file configuration option in the configuration file newrelic-infra.yml. Provide the pid_file using the command line when running the newrelic-infra binary. Set the NRIA_PID_FILE environment variable. Important Since the agent creates or updates the pid-file every time it’s initialized, the user who runs the agent must have read/write permissions over the pid-file location. Use the chown command to give owner rights to a user. For example, if the user nri-agent is running the agent and the pid-file location is set to/var/run/newrelic-infra-custom/nr.pid, then you can give the user rights with: chown nri-agent:nri-agent /var/run/newrelic-infra-custom/ Copy If the agent uses the PIDFILE environment variable Caution We do not recommend using the PIDFILE environment variable to manage the pid-file. If the environment variable PIDFILE is set, the agent will not try to create the pid-file. Create the pid-file in a location of your choice. Tip Use this approach if someone else takes care of the pid-file lifecycle. For example, our init script sets the PIDFILE variable for some service managers, such as SysV, because they handle the creation and content of the pid-file. Change the user and runtime mode The Linux agent runs as root by default, but it also supports running with users with less privileges: PRIVILEGED and UNPRIVILEGED. For more information, see our documentation on agent running modes. Important To execute the agent as a non-root user (PRIVILEGED or UNPRIVILEGED), make sure to grant read/write access to the folders and files provided in the tarball. To change the running mode: Edit the service script: Systemd Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/systemd/newrelic-infra.service. Search for the line [Service]. Add the line User=user_name, and replace user_name with the user that you want to execute the agent (PRIVILEGED or UNPRIVILEGED). Save the file. SysV Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/sysv/newrelic-infra. Search for the line USER=root. Replace root with the user that you want to execute the agent (PRIVILEGED or UNPRIVILEGED). Save the file. Upstart Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/upstart/newrelic-infra. Search for the line exec /usr/bin/newrelic-infra. Replace it with exec su -s /bin/sh -c ‘exec “$0” “$@“’ user_name-- /usr/bin/newrelic-infra. Replace user_name with the user that you want to execute the agent (PRIVILEGED or UNPRIVILEGED). Save the file. If you're running the agent as PRIVILEGED, you must give it two additional Linux capabilities: Make sure the libcap library is installed in your host. (You need the setcap and getcap commands that come with it.) Extract the contents of the tarball and execute the following command with root permission: setcap CAP_SYS_PTRACE,CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH=+ep ./newrelic-infra/usr/bin/newrelic-infra Copy The run mode will be selected based on the current user and the Kernel Capabilities assigned to it. Configure the plugin directory The infrastructure agent allows you to install integrations that monitor and report data from popular services such as Kubernetes, AWS, MySQL, Redis, Kafka, etc. Each integration has its own configuration file, named by default integration-name-config.yml, placed in the predefined location /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/. On initialization, the agent loads the config file. To overwrite the predefined location of the integration configuration file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the plugin_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -plugin_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the agent directory The agent requires its own defined directory to run the installed integrations, caching data (inventory), etc. The default location is /var/db/newrelic-infra/. The agent directory has the following structure and content: LICENSE: Text file containing the New Relic Infrastructure agent license. custom-integrations: Directory that stores the installed the custom integrations. newrelic-integrations: Directory that stores the New Relic official integrations. data: Directory where the agent stores cache data (inventory). Important The user running the agent must have read/write permissions to the agent directory. To overwrite the predefined location of the agent directory, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_AGENT_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the agent_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -agent_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the log file By default the agent stores the log files in /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.log. Important The user running the agent must have write permissions on the log file. To overwrite the predefined location of the log file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_LOG_FILE environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the log_file field. Pass it as a command line argument using -log_file when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Change the location of the agent binary To change the location of the executable, edit the service script: Systemd Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/systemd/newrelic-infra.service. Search for the line [ExecStart=/usr/bin/newrelic-infra]. Replace the path. Save the file. SysV Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/sysv/newrelic-infra. Search for the line DAEMON=/usr/bin/$NAME. Replace the path. Save the file. Upstart Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/upstart/newrelic-infra. Search for the line exec /usr/bin/newrelic-infra. Replace the path. Save the file. What's next? You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data.

Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding.

      "body": "New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent is a lightweight executable file that collects data about your hosts. It also forwards data from infrastructure integrations to New Relic, as well as log data for log analytics. There are multiple ways to install and deploy the infrastructure monitoring agent, depending on your setup and needs. This document describes how the infrastructure monitoring agent works and how to install it. Tip To use infrastructure monitoring and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Quick start: Use our guided install The quickest way to get started with our infrastructure monitoring agent is through our guided install. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install not only installs the infrastructure agent, but also discovers the applications and log sources running in your environment. It recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your infrastructure. Important If you install the agent using the New Relic One UI, the Infrastructure status API is enabled by default. One agent, many capabilities Our infrastructure monitoring agent collects performance and health data about the system resources and processes of the host where it's enabled (on-premises or virtualized). At the same time, it acts as a forwarder for two types of data: core services metrics, which are collected by on-host integrations, and logs. If you want to collect data about core services running on your host, you need to install the infrastructure monitoring agent first, and then install or enable on-host integrations. Our infrastructure monitoring agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services. It can also forward logs to New Relic. Backend application metrics (APM) are collected by separate language agents. Notice how each integration and forwarder feed different data types in the New Relic database (NRDB). Install the infrastructure monitoring agent If our guided install doesn't work for your setup, follow the instructions for your Linux, Windows, or other setup. The infrastructure monitoring agent can currently run on many Linux distributions, as well as Windows Server. For more information on where you can run the agent, check the compatibility and requirements page. Linux The preferred way to install the Linux agent is through the package manager of your distribution. Select your distribution from the list for step-by-step instructions. Amazon Linux CentOS Container (Docker) Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Other Linux distros To use these installation links, you must be logged to your New Relic account. If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or if you prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced install needs, you can deploy the agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual mode. Windows Server and 10 To deploy the agent on a Windows Server host, install it using our MSI installer. For a guided procedure, click the button below and follow the step-by-step instructions: Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced installation needs, you can deploy the agent using our zip files in assisted or manual mode. Other installation scenarios The infrastructure monitoring agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Check the source code The infrastructure monitoring agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.

      "body": "Our custom Linux installation process for infrastructure monitoring allows you to tailor all aspects of the installation process, and to place files and folders on your filesystem. You have full control of the installation. Caution The manual install process is not supervised. If you opt for manual install, you are responsible for placing the different files in the correct folders, providing the correct parameterized configuration values, and ensuring the agent has all the permissions to execute. Install the agent Before installation, check the compatibility and requirements. Additional agent package options Comments Troubleshooting As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend that you add it in your path. Daemon process As of version 1.5.59, the infrastructure agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-service binary, which is used to safely manage usual agent daemon process newrelic-infra. To install the agent: Download the packaged agent file. Unpack the file. Make sure the file unpacks with the following structure: newrelic-infra |-- config_defaults.sh |-- etc | |-- init_scripts | | |-- systemd | | | `-- newrelic-infra.service | | |-- sysv | | | `-- newrelic-infra | | `-- upstart | | `-- newrelic-infra | `-- newrelic-infra | `-- integrations.d |-- installer.sh |-- usr | `-- bin | |-- newrelic-infra | |-- newrelic-infra-ctl | `-- newrelic-infra-service `-- var |-- db | `-- newrelic-infra | |-- custom-integrations | |-- integrations.d | |-- LICENSE.txt | `-- newrelic-integrations |-- log | `-- newrelic-infra `-- run `-- newrelic-infra Copy Install the service script. Optional: Additional install steps. Install: Optional steps You can also carry out these additional steps: Change the location of the configuration file. Change the location of the PID file. Change the user and runtime mode. Configure the plugin directory. Configure the agent directory. Configure the log file. Change the location of the agent binary. Install the service script Before you proceed to install the service script, you need to determine which service manager your system is using: If you use one of the supported service managers (SystemD, SysV, and Upstart), use the service script provided in the tarball. If you use a service manager we do not support, you must write your own service script. Important In case of doubt, check your Linux distribution's official documentation. Determine your service manager There's no good way you can programmatically know which service manager is being used in your host, but we can give you some heuristics. To determine the service manager, use the following commands: command -v systemctl (used in Systemd) command -v update-rc.d (used in SysV) command -v initctl (used in Upstart) The first command that returns an output indicates which service manager your system uses. Tip For example, run the following sequence: $ command -v systemctl $ command -v initctl /sbin/initctl Copy Based on this output, Upstart is the service manager, since it's the command that obtained a return. Important Before copying the service manager script, check if you need to change the user, the path of the agent’s binary, or the pid file location. All these changes need to be reflected in the service script. If you use one of the supported service managers, install the service script for your host: Systemd Copy the service file ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/systemd/newrelic-infra.service to /etc/systemd/system/newrelic-infra.service Enable the service script: systemctl enable newrelic-infra.service Copy SysV Copy the service file ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/sysv/newrelic-infra to /etc/init.d/system/newrelic-infra Run the following commands: update-rc.d newrelic-infra defaults update-rc.d newrelic-infra enable Copy Upstart Copy the service file ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/upstart/newrelic-infra to /etc/init/newrelic-infra.conf Run the following command: initctl reload-configuration Copy Your service script is configured. Configure the rest of the options and start the service manually. Change config file's location The infrastructure agent includes a configuration file, usually named newrelic-infra.yml, to fine-tune the agent's behavior. For more information, see a config file template and how to configure the agent. By default, the agent searches for the configuration file in one of these locations: newrelic-infra.yml (working directory root folder) /etc/newrelic-infra.yml /etc/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.yml To specify a different location, use the -config flag command-line. For example: usr/bin/newrelic-infra -config /whatever/path/custom_config_name.yml Copy To make this change permanent, edit the service script: Systemd Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/systemd/newrelic-infra.service. Search for the line ExecStart=/usr/bin/newrelic-infra. Add the config flag and the config file path. In this example the config file is located in the /opt directory ExecStart=/usr/bin/newrelic-infra -config /opt/config.yaml. Save the file. SysV Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/sysv/newrelic-infra. Search for the line DAEMON=/usr/bin/$NAME”. Below the DAEMON variable, add this new line: EXTRA_OPTS=\"-config config_file\" (with the quotation marks). Replace config_file with the path to the config file you want to use. Save the file. Upstart Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/upstart/newrelic-infra. Search for the line exec /usr/bin/newrelic-infra. Add the config flag and the config file path. Here the config file is located in the /opt directory exec /usr/bin/newrelic-infra -config /opt/config.yaml. Save the file. Change the pid-file location The infrastructure agent uses a pid-file to keep the process identification number (pid), which is used to identify a running instance of the agent. How to change the location of the pid-file depends on how the agent is configured. Important By default, we recommend that the agent creates the pid-file. You can edit the location if necessary. To change the location of the pid-file: If the agent creates the pid-file On startup, the agent writes its process pid into the pid-file. If the file doesn’t exist it will create it. By default, the agent creates the pid-file using the path /var/run/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.pid. To modify it, use one of these options: Add the pid_file configuration option in the configuration file newrelic-infra.yml. Provide the pid_file using the command line when running the newrelic-infra binary. Set the NRIA_PID_FILE environment variable. Important Since the agent creates or updates the pid-file every time it’s initialized, the user who runs the agent must have read/write permissions over the pid-file location. Use the chown command to give owner rights to a user. For example, if the user nri-agent is running the agent and the pid-file location is set to/var/run/newrelic-infra-custom/nr.pid, then you can give the user rights with: chown nri-agent:nri-agent /var/run/newrelic-infra-custom/ Copy If the agent uses the PIDFILE environment variable Caution We do not recommend using the PIDFILE environment variable to manage the pid-file. If the environment variable PIDFILE is set, the agent will not try to create the pid-file. Create the pid-file in a location of your choice. Tip Use this approach if someone else takes care of the pid-file lifecycle. For example, our init script sets the PIDFILE variable for some service managers, such as SysV, because they handle the creation and content of the pid-file. Change the user and runtime mode The Linux agent runs as root by default, but it also supports running with users with less privileges: PRIVILEGED and UNPRIVILEGED. For more information, see our documentation on agent running modes. Important To execute the agent as a non-root user (PRIVILEGED or UNPRIVILEGED), make sure to grant read/write access to the folders and files provided in the tarball. To change the running mode: Edit the service script: Systemd Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/systemd/newrelic-infra.service. Search for the line [Service]. Add the line User=user_name, and replace user_name with the user that you want to execute the agent (PRIVILEGED or UNPRIVILEGED). Save the file. SysV Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/sysv/newrelic-infra. Search for the line USER=root. Replace root with the user that you want to execute the agent (PRIVILEGED or UNPRIVILEGED). Save the file. Upstart Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/upstart/newrelic-infra. Search for the line exec /usr/bin/newrelic-infra. Replace it with exec su -s /bin/sh -c ‘exec “$0” “$@“’ user_name-- /usr/bin/newrelic-infra. Replace user_name with the user that you want to execute the agent (PRIVILEGED or UNPRIVILEGED). Save the file. If you're running the agent as PRIVILEGED, you must give it two additional Linux capabilities: Make sure the libcap library is installed in your host. (You need the setcap and getcap commands that come with it.) Extract the contents of the tarball and execute the following command with root permission: setcap CAP_SYS_PTRACE,CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH=+ep ./newrelic-infra/usr/bin/newrelic-infra Copy The run mode will be selected based on the current user and the Kernel Capabilities assigned to it. Configure the plugin directory The infrastructure agent allows you to install integrations that monitor and report data from popular services such as Kubernetes, AWS, MySQL, Redis, Kafka, etc. Each integration has its own configuration file, named by default integration-name-config.yml, placed in the predefined location /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/. On initialization, the agent loads the config file. To overwrite the predefined location of the integration configuration file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the plugin_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -plugin_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the agent directory The agent requires its own defined directory to run the installed integrations, caching data (inventory), etc. The default location is /var/db/newrelic-infra/. The agent directory has the following structure and content: LICENSE: Text file containing the New Relic Infrastructure agent license. custom-integrations: Directory that stores the installed the custom integrations. newrelic-integrations: Directory that stores the New Relic official integrations. data: Directory where the agent stores cache data (inventory). Important The user running the agent must have read/write permissions to the agent directory. To overwrite the predefined location of the agent directory, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_AGENT_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the agent_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -agent_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the log file By default the agent stores the log files in /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.log. Important The user running the agent must have write permissions on the log file. To overwrite the predefined location of the log file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_LOG_FILE environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the log_file field. Pass it as a command line argument using -log_file when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Change the location of the agent binary To change the location of the executable, edit the service script: Systemd Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/systemd/newrelic-infra.service. Search for the line [ExecStart=/usr/bin/newrelic-infra]. Replace the path. Save the file. SysV Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/sysv/newrelic-infra. Search for the line DAEMON=/usr/bin/$NAME. Replace the path. Save the file. Upstart Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/upstart/newrelic-infra. Search for the line exec /usr/bin/newrelic-infra. Replace the path. Save the file. What's next? You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures.

      "body": "New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent is a lightweight executable file that collects data about your hosts. It also forwards data from infrastructure integrations to New Relic, as well as log data for log analytics. There are multiple ways to install and deploy the infrastructure monitoring agent, depending on your setup and needs. This document describes how the infrastructure monitoring agent works and how to install it. Tip To use infrastructure monitoring and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Quick start: Use our guided install The quickest way to get started with our infrastructure monitoring agent is through our guided install. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install not only installs the infrastructure agent, but also discovers the applications and log sources running in your environment. It recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your infrastructure. Important If you install the agent using the New Relic One UI, the Infrastructure status API is enabled by default. One agent, many capabilities Our infrastructure monitoring agent collects performance and health data about the system resources and processes of the host where it's enabled (on-premises or virtualized). At the same time, it acts as a forwarder for two types of data: core services metrics, which are collected by on-host integrations, and logs. If you want to collect data about core services running on your host, you need to install the infrastructure monitoring agent first, and then install or enable on-host integrations. Our infrastructure monitoring agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services. It can also forward logs to New Relic. Backend application metrics (APM) are collected by separate language agents. Notice how each integration and forwarder feed different data types in the New Relic database (NRDB). Install the infrastructure monitoring agent If our guided install doesn't work for your setup, follow the instructions for your Linux, Windows, or other setup. The infrastructure monitoring agent can currently run on many Linux distributions, as well as Windows Server. For more information on where you can run the agent, check the compatibility and requirements page. Linux The preferred way to install the Linux agent is through the package manager of your distribution. Select your distribution from the list for step-by-step instructions. Amazon Linux CentOS Container (Docker) Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Other Linux distros To use these installation links, you must be logged to your New Relic account. If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or if you prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced install needs, you can deploy the agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual mode. Windows Server and 10 To deploy the agent on a Windows Server host, install it using our MSI installer. For a guided procedure, click the button below and follow the step-by-step instructions: Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced installation needs, you can deploy the agent using our zip files in assisted or manual mode. Other installation scenarios The infrastructure monitoring agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Check the source code The infrastructure monitoring agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.

      "body": "Our custom Linux installation process for infrastructure monitoring allows you to tailor all aspects of the installation process, and to place files and folders on your filesystem. You have full control of the installation. Caution The manual install process is not supervised. If you opt for manual install, you are responsible for placing the different files in the correct folders, providing the correct parameterized configuration values, and ensuring the agent has all the permissions to execute. Install the agent Before installation, check the compatibility and requirements. Additional agent package options Comments Troubleshooting As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend that you add it in your path. Daemon process As of version 1.5.59, the infrastructure agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-service binary, which is used to safely manage usual agent daemon process newrelic-infra. To install the agent: Download the packaged agent file. Unpack the file. Make sure the file unpacks with the following structure: newrelic-infra |-- config_defaults.sh |-- etc | |-- init_scripts | | |-- systemd | | | `-- newrelic-infra.service | | |-- sysv | | | `-- newrelic-infra | | `-- upstart | | `-- newrelic-infra | `-- newrelic-infra | `-- integrations.d |-- installer.sh |-- usr | `-- bin | |-- newrelic-infra | |-- newrelic-infra-ctl | `-- newrelic-infra-service `-- var |-- db | `-- newrelic-infra | |-- custom-integrations | |-- integrations.d | |-- LICENSE.txt | `-- newrelic-integrations |-- log | `-- newrelic-infra `-- run `-- newrelic-infra Copy Install the service script. Optional: Additional install steps. Install: Optional steps You can also carry out these additional steps: Change the location of the configuration file. Change the location of the PID file. Change the user and runtime mode. Configure the plugin directory. Configure the agent directory. Configure the log file. Change the location of the agent binary. Install the service script Before you proceed to install the service script, you need to determine which service manager your system is using: If you use one of the supported service managers (SystemD, SysV, and Upstart), use the service script provided in the tarball. If you use a service manager we do not support, you must write your own service script. Important In case of doubt, check your Linux distribution's official documentation. Determine your service manager There's no good way you can programmatically know which service manager is being used in your host, but we can give you some heuristics. To determine the service manager, use the following commands: command -v systemctl (used in Systemd) command -v update-rc.d (used in SysV) command -v initctl (used in Upstart) The first command that returns an output indicates which service manager your system uses. Tip For example, run the following sequence: $ command -v systemctl $ command -v initctl /sbin/initctl Copy Based on this output, Upstart is the service manager, since it's the command that obtained a return. Important Before copying the service manager script, check if you need to change the user, the path of the agent’s binary, or the pid file location. All these changes need to be reflected in the service script. If you use one of the supported service managers, install the service script for your host: Systemd Copy the service file ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/systemd/newrelic-infra.service to /etc/systemd/system/newrelic-infra.service Enable the service script: systemctl enable newrelic-infra.service Copy SysV Copy the service file ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/sysv/newrelic-infra to /etc/init.d/system/newrelic-infra Run the following commands: update-rc.d newrelic-infra defaults update-rc.d newrelic-infra enable Copy Upstart Copy the service file ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/upstart/newrelic-infra to /etc/init/newrelic-infra.conf Run the following command: initctl reload-configuration Copy Your service script is configured. Configure the rest of the options and start the service manually. Change config file's location The infrastructure agent includes a configuration file, usually named newrelic-infra.yml, to fine-tune the agent's behavior. For more information, see a config file template and how to configure the agent. By default, the agent searches for the configuration file in one of these locations: newrelic-infra.yml (working directory root folder) /etc/newrelic-infra.yml /etc/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.yml To specify a different location, use the -config flag command-line. For example: usr/bin/newrelic-infra -config /whatever/path/custom_config_name.yml Copy To make this change permanent, edit the service script: Systemd Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/systemd/newrelic-infra.service. Search for the line ExecStart=/usr/bin/newrelic-infra. Add the config flag and the config file path. In this example the config file is located in the /opt directory ExecStart=/usr/bin/newrelic-infra -config /opt/config.yaml. Save the file. SysV Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/sysv/newrelic-infra. Search for the line DAEMON=/usr/bin/$NAME”. Below the DAEMON variable, add this new line: EXTRA_OPTS=\"-config config_file\" (with the quotation marks). Replace config_file with the path to the config file you want to use. Save the file. Upstart Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/upstart/newrelic-infra. Search for the line exec /usr/bin/newrelic-infra. Add the config flag and the config file path. Here the config file is located in the /opt directory exec /usr/bin/newrelic-infra -config /opt/config.yaml. Save the file. Change the pid-file location The infrastructure agent uses a pid-file to keep the process identification number (pid), which is used to identify a running instance of the agent. How to change the location of the pid-file depends on how the agent is configured. Important By default, we recommend that the agent creates the pid-file. You can edit the location if necessary. To change the location of the pid-file: If the agent creates the pid-file On startup, the agent writes its process pid into the pid-file. If the file doesn’t exist it will create it. By default, the agent creates the pid-file using the path /var/run/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.pid. To modify it, use one of these options: Add the pid_file configuration option in the configuration file newrelic-infra.yml. Provide the pid_file using the command line when running the newrelic-infra binary. Set the NRIA_PID_FILE environment variable. Important Since the agent creates or updates the pid-file every time it’s initialized, the user who runs the agent must have read/write permissions over the pid-file location. Use the chown command to give owner rights to a user. For example, if the user nri-agent is running the agent and the pid-file location is set to/var/run/newrelic-infra-custom/nr.pid, then you can give the user rights with: chown nri-agent:nri-agent /var/run/newrelic-infra-custom/ Copy If the agent uses the PIDFILE environment variable Caution We do not recommend using the PIDFILE environment variable to manage the pid-file. If the environment variable PIDFILE is set, the agent will not try to create the pid-file. Create the pid-file in a location of your choice. Tip Use this approach if someone else takes care of the pid-file lifecycle. For example, our init script sets the PIDFILE variable for some service managers, such as SysV, because they handle the creation and content of the pid-file. Change the user and runtime mode The Linux agent runs as root by default, but it also supports running with users with less privileges: PRIVILEGED and UNPRIVILEGED. For more information, see our documentation on agent running modes. Important To execute the agent as a non-root user (PRIVILEGED or UNPRIVILEGED), make sure to grant read/write access to the folders and files provided in the tarball. To change the running mode: Edit the service script: Systemd Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/systemd/newrelic-infra.service. Search for the line [Service]. Add the line User=user_name, and replace user_name with the user that you want to execute the agent (PRIVILEGED or UNPRIVILEGED). Save the file. SysV Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/sysv/newrelic-infra. Search for the line USER=root. Replace root with the user that you want to execute the agent (PRIVILEGED or UNPRIVILEGED). Save the file. Upstart Open the service script ./newrelic-infra/etc/init_scripts/upstart/newrelic-infra. Search for the line exec /usr/bin/newrelic-infra. Replace it with exec su -s /bin/sh -c ‘exec “$0” “$@“’ user_name-- /usr/bin/newrelic-infra. Replace user_name with the user that you want to execute the agent (PRIVILEGED or UNPRIVILEGED). Save the file. If you're running the agent as PRIVILEGED, you must give it two additional Linux capabilities: Make sure the libcap library is installed in your host. (You need the setcap and getcap commands that come with it.) Extract the contents of the tarball and execute the following command with root permission: setcap CAP_SYS_PTRACE,CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH=+ep ./newrelic-infra/usr/bin/newrelic-infra Copy The run mode will be selected based on the current user and the Kernel Capabilities assigned to it. Configure the plugin directory The infrastructure agent allows you to install integrations that monitor and report data from popular services such as Kubernetes, AWS, MySQL, Redis, Kafka, etc. Each integration has its own configuration file, named by default integration-name-config.yml, placed in the predefined location /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/. On initialization, the agent loads the config file. To overwrite the predefined location of the integration configuration file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the plugin_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -plugin_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the agent directory The agent requires its own defined directory to run the installed integrations, caching data (inventory), etc. The default location is /var/db/newrelic-infra/. The agent directory has the following structure and content: LICENSE: Text file containing the New Relic Infrastructure agent license. custom-integrations: Directory that stores the installed the custom integrations. newrelic-integrations: Directory that stores the New Relic official integrations. data: Directory where the agent stores cache data (inventory). Important The user running the agent must have read/write permissions to the agent directory. To overwrite the predefined location of the agent directory, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_AGENT_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the agent_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -agent_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the log file By default the agent stores the log files in /var/db/newrelic-infra/newrelic-infra.log. Important The user running the agent must have write permissions on the log file. To overwrite the predefined location of the log file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_LOG_FILE environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the log_file field. Pass it as a command line argument using -log_file when you run the newrelic-infra binary.

Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding.

      "body": "New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent is a lightweight executable file that collects data about your hosts. It also forwards data from infrastructure integrations to New Relic, as well as log data for log analytics. There are multiple ways to install and deploy the infrastructure monitoring agent, depending on your setup and needs. This document describes how the infrastructure monitoring agent works and how to install it. Tip To use infrastructure monitoring and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Quick start: Use our guided install The quickest way to get started with our infrastructure monitoring agent is through our guided install. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install not only installs the infrastructure agent, but also discovers the applications and log sources running in your environment. It recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your infrastructure. Important If you install the agent using the New Relic One UI, the Infrastructure status API is enabled by default. One agent, many capabilities Our infrastructure monitoring agent collects performance and health data about the system resources and processes of the host where it's enabled (on-premises or virtualized). At the same time, it acts as a forwarder for two types of data: core services metrics, which are collected by on-host integrations, and logs. If you want to collect data about core services running on your host, you need to install the infrastructure monitoring agent first, and then install or enable on-host integrations. Our infrastructure monitoring agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services. It can also forward logs to New Relic. Backend application metrics (APM) are collected by separate language agents. Notice how each integration and forwarder feed different data types in the New Relic database (NRDB). Install the infrastructure monitoring agent If our guided install doesn't work for your setup, follow the instructions for your Linux, Windows, or other setup. The infrastructure monitoring agent can currently run on many Linux distributions, as well as Windows Server. For more information on where you can run the agent, check the compatibility and requirements page. Linux The preferred way to install the Linux agent is through the package manager of your distribution. Select your distribution from the list for step-by-step instructions. Amazon Linux CentOS Container (Docker) Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Other Linux distros To use these installation links, you must be logged to your New Relic account. If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or if you prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced install needs, you can deploy the agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual mode. Windows Server and 10 To deploy the agent on a Windows Server host, install it using our MSI installer. For a guided procedure, click the button below and follow the step-by-step instructions: Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced installation needs, you can deploy the agent using our zip files in assisted or manual mode. Other installation scenarios The infrastructure monitoring agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Check the source code The infrastructure monitoring agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent is a lightweight executable file that collects data about your hosts. It also forwards data from infrastructure integrations to New Relic, as well as log data for log analytics. There are multiple ways to install and deploy the infrastructure monitoring agent, depending on your setup and needs. This document describes how the infrastructure monitoring agent works and how to install it. Tip To use infrastructure monitoring and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Quick start: Use our guided install The quickest way to get started with our infrastructure monitoring agent is through our guided install. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install not only installs the infrastructure agent, but also discovers the applications and log sources running in your environment. It recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your infrastructure. Important If you install the agent using the New Relic One UI, the Infrastructure status API is enabled by default. One agent, many capabilities Our infrastructure monitoring agent collects performance and health data about the system resources and processes of the host where it's enabled (on-premises or virtualized). At the same time, it acts as a forwarder for two types of data: core services metrics, which are collected by on-host integrations, and logs. If you want to collect data about core services running on your host, you need to install the infrastructure monitoring agent first, and then install or enable on-host integrations. Our infrastructure monitoring agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services. It can also forward logs to New Relic. Backend application metrics (APM) are collected by separate language agents. Notice how each integration and forwarder feed different data types in the New Relic database (NRDB). Install the infrastructure monitoring agent If our guided install doesn't work for your setup, follow the instructions for your Linux, Windows, or other setup. The infrastructure monitoring agent can currently run on many Linux distributions, as well as Windows Server. For more information on where you can run the agent, check the compatibility and requirements page. Linux The preferred way to install the Linux agent is through the package manager of your distribution. Select your distribution from the list for step-by-step instructions. Amazon Linux CentOS Container (Docker) Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Other Linux distros To use these installation links, you must be logged to your New Relic account. If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or if you prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced install needs, you can deploy the agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual mode. Windows Server and 10 To deploy the agent on a Windows Server host, install it using our MSI installer. For a guided procedure, click the button below and follow the step-by-step instructions: Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced installation needs, you can deploy the agent using our zip files in assisted or manual mode. Other installation scenarios The infrastructure monitoring agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Check the source code The infrastructure monitoring agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.

The agent supports Amazon Linux, CentOS, Debian, RHEL, and Ubuntu as well as Windows Server. All of these agent versions exhibit a common set of behaviors. Agent service As of infrastructure agent v1.5.59, the agent bundles a binary named newrelic-infra-service. This binary can be managed by the OS service manager. At service startup time, this binary spawns (executes) the usual newrelic-infra process and supervises its child execution. Therefore agent service process should never be restarted, unless triggered via OS service manager. Agent startup During startup the agent will: Register a signal handler. Set the loggers. Load the configuration from file, environment variables, and call arguments. Register plugins for harvesting inventory, samplers, and integrations. StatsD integration with http_server_enabled\" Open an http port (by default, 8001) for receiving data. Startup duration before harvesting and sending data is usually less than six seconds. Monitoring and resource caps By default, the infrastructure agent runs in a single core. Every second it checks if there are events to send and, if there are, it sends them to the New Relic collector. Events that may be sent include: Default infrastructure events Events recorded by New Relic integrations. For descriptions of the default infrastructure events and their collection frequencies, see Infrastructure events. Integration data Integration monitoring is done by executing integration commands at given intervals (set in the config files) and reading their stout/err. The more integrations you enable, the greater the footprint of the agent. For more information, see the documentation for specific integrations. Agent shutdown When a shutdown signal is received, the agent stops all the registered plugins and integration processes. Maintenance The agent runs as a service. On installation, we set up all the service manager-required files, such as the systemD. service file. In case of a catastrophic failure, the service manager configuration will restart the agent. There are no automatic updates to agents. To install a new agent version: Linux: Manually install agent versions through the appropriate package manager (apt, yum, zypper). Windows: Manually download the msi package and install it with msiexec.exe. Retry behavior If a request made to the ingest service is unsuccessful, the payload is discarded; subsequent requests follow an exponential backoff pattern until one succeeds. For inventory, we store the deltas between system states in cache files. On failure, these deltas are not deleted but are reused on requests that follow.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent is a lightweight executable file that collects data about your hosts. It also forwards data from infrastructure integrations to New Relic, as well as log data for log analytics. There are multiple ways to install and deploy the infrastructure monitoring agent, depending on your setup and needs. This document describes how the infrastructure monitoring agent works and how to install it. Tip To use infrastructure monitoring and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Quick start: Use our guided install The quickest way to get started with our infrastructure monitoring agent is through our guided install. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install not only installs the infrastructure agent, but also discovers the applications and log sources running in your environment. It recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your infrastructure. Important If you install the agent using the New Relic One UI, the Infrastructure status API is enabled by default. One agent, many capabilities Our infrastructure monitoring agent collects performance and health data about the system resources and processes of the host where it's enabled (on-premises or virtualized). At the same time, it acts as a forwarder for two types of data: core services metrics, which are collected by on-host integrations, and logs. If you want to collect data about core services running on your host, you need to install the infrastructure monitoring agent first, and then install or enable on-host integrations. Our infrastructure monitoring agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services. It can also forward logs to New Relic. Backend application metrics (APM) are collected by separate language agents. Notice how each integration and forwarder feed different data types in the New Relic database (NRDB). Install the infrastructure monitoring agent If our guided install doesn't work for your setup, follow the instructions for your Linux, Windows, or other setup. The infrastructure monitoring agent can currently run on many Linux distributions, as well as Windows Server. For more information on where you can run the agent, check the compatibility and requirements page. Linux The preferred way to install the Linux agent is through the package manager of your distribution. Select your distribution from the list for step-by-step instructions. Amazon Linux CentOS Container (Docker) Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Other Linux distros To use these installation links, you must be logged to your New Relic account. If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or if you prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced install needs, you can deploy the agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual mode. Windows Server and 10 To deploy the agent on a Windows Server host, install it using our MSI installer. For a guided procedure, click the button below and follow the step-by-step instructions: Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced installation needs, you can deploy the agent using our zip files in assisted or manual mode. Other installation scenarios The infrastructure monitoring agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Check the source code The infrastructure monitoring agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.

      "body": "New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent is a lightweight executable file that collects data about your hosts. It also forwards data from infrastructure integrations to New Relic, as well as log data for log analytics. There are multiple ways to install and deploy the infrastructure monitoring agent, depending on your setup and needs. This document describes how the infrastructure monitoring agent works and how to install it. Tip To use infrastructure monitoring and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Quick start: Use our guided install The quickest way to get started with our infrastructure monitoring agent is through our guided install. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install not only installs the infrastructure agent, but also discovers the applications and log sources running in your environment. It recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your infrastructure. Important If you install the agent using the New Relic One UI, the Infrastructure status API is enabled by default. One agent, many capabilities Our infrastructure monitoring agent collects performance and health data about the system resources and processes of the host where it's enabled (on-premises or virtualized). At the same time, it acts as a forwarder for two types of data: core services metrics, which are collected by on-host integrations, and logs. If you want to collect data about core services running on your host, you need to install the infrastructure monitoring agent first, and then install or enable on-host integrations. Our infrastructure monitoring agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services. It can also forward logs to New Relic. Backend application metrics (APM) are collected by separate language agents. Notice how each integration and forwarder feed different data types in the New Relic database (NRDB). Install the infrastructure monitoring agent If our guided install doesn't work for your setup, follow the instructions for your Linux, Windows, or other setup. The infrastructure monitoring agent can currently run on many Linux distributions, as well as Windows Server. For more information on where you can run the agent, check the compatibility and requirements page. Linux The preferred way to install the Linux agent is through the package manager of your distribution. Select your distribution from the list for step-by-step instructions. Amazon Linux CentOS Container (Docker) Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Other Linux distros To use these installation links, you must be logged to your New Relic account. If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or if you prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced install needs, you can deploy the agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual mode. Windows Server and 10 To deploy the agent on a Windows Server host, install it using our MSI installer. For a guided procedure, click the button below and follow the step-by-step instructions: Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced installation needs, you can deploy the agent using our zip files in assisted or manual mode. Other installation scenarios The infrastructure monitoring agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Check the source code The infrastructure monitoring agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README. What's next After you've installed the infrastructure monitoring agent: Learn how to configure the agent or edit the config template. Install on-host integrations (for example, for Apache or MySQL).

      "body": "With the infrastructure agent, you can monitor not only individual servers, but also understand how your service performs as a whole. The agent supports Amazon Linux, CentOS, Debian, RHEL, and Ubuntu as well as Windows Server. All of these agent versions exhibit a common set of behaviors. Agent service As of infrastructure agent v1.5.59, the agent bundles a binary named newrelic-infra-service. This binary can be managed by the OS service manager. At service startup time, this binary spawns (executes) the usual newrelic-infra process and supervises its child execution. Therefore agent service process should never be restarted, unless triggered via OS service manager. Agent startup During startup the agent will: Register a signal handler. Set the loggers. Load the configuration from file, environment variables, and call arguments. Register plugins for harvesting inventory, samplers, and integrations. StatsD integration with http_server_enabled\" Open an http port (by default, 8001) for receiving data. Startup duration before harvesting and sending data is usually less than six seconds. Monitoring and resource caps By default, the infrastructure agent runs in a single core. Every second it checks if there are events to send and, if there are, it sends them to the New Relic collector. Events that may be sent include: Default infrastructure events Events recorded by New Relic integrations. For descriptions of the default infrastructure events and their collection frequencies, see Infrastructure events. Integration data Integration monitoring is done by executing integration commands at given intervals (set in the config files) and reading their stout/err. The more integrations you enable, the greater the footprint of the agent. For more information, see the documentation for specific integrations. Agent shutdown When a shutdown signal is received, the agent stops all the registered plugins and integration processes. Maintenance The agent runs as a service. On installation, we set up all the service manager-required files, such as the systemD. service file. In case of a catastrophic failure, the service manager configuration will restart the agent. There are no automatic updates to agents. To install a new agent version: Linux: Manually install agent versions through the appropriate package manager (apt, yum, zypper). Windows: Manually download the msi package and install it with msiexec.exe. Retry behavior If a request made to the ingest service is unsuccessful, the payload is discarded; subsequent requests follow an exponential backoff pattern until one succeeds. For inventory, we store the deltas between system states in cache files. On failure, these deltas are not deleted but are reused on requests that follow.

It also forwards data from infrastructure integrations to New Relic, as well as log data for log analytics. There are multiple ways to install and deploy the infrastructure monitoring agent, depending on your setup and needs. This document describes how the infrastructure monitoring agent works and how to install it.

Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Quick start: Use our guided install The quickest way to get started with our infrastructure monitoring agent is through our guided install. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install not only installs the infrastructure agent, but also discovers the applications and log sources running in your environment. It recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your infrastructure. Important If you install the agent using the New Relic One UI, the Infrastructure status API is enabled by default. One agent, many capabilities Our infrastructure monitoring agent collects performance and health data about the system resources and processes of the host where it's enabled (on-premises or virtualized). At the same time, it acts as a forwarder for two types of data: core services metrics, which are collected by on-host integrations, and logs. If you want to collect data about core services running on your host, you need to install the infrastructure monitoring agent first, and then install or enable on-host integrations. Our infrastructure monitoring agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services. It can also forward logs to New Relic. Backend application metrics (APM) are collected by separate language agents. Notice how each integration and forwarder feed different data types in the New Relic database (NRDB). Install the infrastructure monitoring agent If our guided install doesn't work for your setup, follow the instructions for your Linux, Windows, or other setup. The infrastructure monitoring agent can currently run on many Linux distributions, as well as Windows Server. For more information on where you can run the agent, check the compatibility and requirements page. Linux The preferred way to install the Linux agent is through the package manager of your distribution. Select your distribution from the list for step-by-step instructions. Amazon Linux CentOS Container (Docker) Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Other Linux distros To use these installation links, you must be logged to your New Relic account. If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or if you prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced install needs, you can deploy the agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual mode. Windows Server and 10 To deploy the agent on a Windows Server host, install it using our MSI installer. For a guided procedure, click the button below and follow the step-by-step instructions: Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced installation needs, you can deploy the agent using our zip files in assisted or manual mode. Other installation scenarios The infrastructure monitoring agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Check the source code The infrastructure monitoring agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README. What's next After you've installed the infrastructure monitoring agent: Learn how to configure the agent or edit the config template. Install on-host integrations (for example, for Apache or MySQL).

      "body": "With the infrastructure agent, you can monitor not only individual servers, but also understand how your service performs as a whole. The agent supports Amazon Linux, CentOS, Debian, RHEL, and Ubuntu as well as Windows Server. All of these agent versions exhibit a common set of behaviors. Agent service As of infrastructure agent v1.5.59, the agent bundles a binary named newrelic-infra-service. This binary can be managed by the OS service manager. At service startup time, this binary spawns (executes) the usual newrelic-infra process and supervises its child execution. Therefore agent service process should never be restarted, unless triggered via OS service manager. Agent startup During startup the agent will: Register a signal handler. Set the loggers. Load the configuration from file, environment variables, and call arguments. Register plugins for harvesting inventory, samplers, and integrations. StatsD integration with http_server_enabled\" Open an http port (by default, 8001) for receiving data. Startup duration before harvesting and sending data is usually less than six seconds. Monitoring and resource caps By default, the infrastructure agent runs in a single core. Every second it checks if there are events to send and, if there are, it sends them to the New Relic collector. Events that may be sent include: Default infrastructure events Events recorded by New Relic integrations. For descriptions of the default infrastructure events and their collection frequencies, see Infrastructure events. Integration data Integration monitoring is done by executing integration commands at given intervals (set in the config files) and reading their stout/err. The more integrations you enable, the greater the footprint of the agent. For more information, see the documentation for specific integrations. Agent shutdown When a shutdown signal is received, the agent stops all the registered plugins and integration processes. Maintenance The agent runs as a service. On installation, we set up all the service manager-required files, such as the systemD. service file. In case of a catastrophic failure, the service manager configuration will restart the agent. There are no automatic updates to agents. To install a new agent version: Linux: Manually install agent versions through the appropriate package manager (apt, yum, zypper). Windows: Manually download the msi package and install it with msiexec.exe. Retry behavior If a request made to the ingest service is unsuccessful, the payload is discarded; subsequent requests follow an exponential backoff pattern until one succeeds. For inventory, we store the deltas between system states in cache files. On failure, these deltas are not deleted but are reused on requests that follow.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

If you want to collect data about core services running on your host, you need to install the infrastructure monitoring agent first, and then install or enable on-host integrations. Our infrastructure monitoring agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services. It can also forward logs to New Relic. Backend application metrics (APM) are collected by separate language agents. Notice how each integration and forwarder feed different data types in the New Relic database (NRDB). Install the infrastructure monitoring agent If our guided install doesn't work for your setup, follow the instructions for your Linux, Windows, or other setup. The infrastructure monitoring agent can currently run on many Linux distributions, as well as Windows Server. For more information on where you can run the agent, check the compatibility and requirements page. Linux The preferred way to install the Linux agent is through the package manager of your distribution. Select your distribution from the list for step-by-step instructions. Amazon Linux CentOS Container (Docker) Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Other Linux distros To use these installation links, you must be logged to your New Relic account. If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or if you prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced install needs, you can deploy the agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual mode. Windows Server and 10 To deploy the agent on a Windows Server host, install it using our MSI installer. For a guided procedure, click the button below and follow the step-by-step instructions: Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced installation needs, you can deploy the agent using our zip files in assisted or manual mode. Other installation scenarios The infrastructure monitoring agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Check the source code The infrastructure monitoring agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.

The agent supports Amazon Linux, CentOS, Debian, RHEL, and Ubuntu as well as Windows Server. All of these agent versions exhibit a common set of behaviors. Agent service As of infrastructure agent v1.5.59, the agent bundles a binary named newrelic-infra-service. This binary can be managed by the OS service manager. At service startup time, this binary spawns (executes) the usual newrelic-infra process and supervises its child execution. Therefore agent service process should never be restarted, unless triggered via OS service manager. Agent startup During startup the agent will: Register a signal handler. Set the loggers. Load the configuration from file, environment variables, and call arguments. Register plugins for harvesting inventory, samplers, and integrations. StatsD integration with http_server_enabled\" Open an http port (by default, 8001) for receiving data. Startup duration before harvesting and sending data is usually less than six seconds. Monitoring and resource caps By default, the infrastructure agent runs in a single core. Every second it checks if there are events to send and, if there are, it sends them to the New Relic collector. Events that may be sent include: Default infrastructure events Events recorded by New Relic integrations. For descriptions of the default infrastructure events and their collection frequencies, see Infrastructure events. Integration data Integration monitoring is done by executing integration commands at given intervals (set in the config files) and reading their stout/err. The more integrations you enable, the greater the footprint of the agent. For more information, see the documentation for specific integrations. Agent shutdown When a shutdown signal is received, the agent stops all the registered plugins and integration processes. Maintenance The agent runs as a service. On installation, we set up all the service manager-required files, such as the systemD. service file. In case of a catastrophic failure, the service manager configuration will restart the agent. There are no automatic updates to agents. To install a new agent version: Linux: Manually install agent versions through the appropriate package manager (apt, yum, zypper). Windows: Manually download the msi package and install it with msiexec.exe. Retry behavior If a request made to the ingest service is unsuccessful, the payload is discarded; subsequent requests follow an exponential backoff pattern until one succeeds. For inventory, we store the deltas between system states in cache files. On failure, these deltas are not deleted but are reused on requests that follow.

Tip To install the infrastructure agent for the first time, see the installation documentation for Linux, Windows, or configuration management tools. To uninstall the infrastructure agent, see Uninstall the Infrastructure agent. View the infrastructure agent version The infrastructure agent does not update itself automatically. Check the infrastructure agent release notes to make sure you have the latest agent version. To view the current infrastructure agent version for a host, use any of these options: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Settings > Agents > Agent version. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts > (select a host). Create a query for SystemSample. Update the agent for installs using the package manager If you used the default installation process, use your package manager to update the program and its dependencies to the latest version. Here are examples for some common systems: Update using apt ( Debian, Ubuntu) To manually update the infrastructure agent with apt-get: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade newrelic-infra -y Copy Update using yum ( Amazon Linux, CentOS, RHEL) To manually update the infrastructure agent with yum: sudo yum update newrelic-infra -y Copy After updating you may need to start the agent. Update using Zypper ( SLES) To manually update the infrastructure agent with Zypper: sudo zypper -n update newrelic-infra Copy After updating you may need to start the agent. Update on Windows Server (32 bits) To manually update the infrastructure agent on Windows Server: Download the latest .MSI installer image from download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/386/newrelic-infra-386.msi Run the install script. To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\newrelic-infra-386.msi Copy After updating you may need to start the agent. Update on Windows Server (64 bits) To manually update the infrastructure agent on Windows Server: Download the latest .MSI installer image from download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/newrelic-infra.msi Run the install script. To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\newrelic-infra.msi Copy After updating you may need to start the agent. Update with config management tools To update the infrastructure agent using your configuration management tool, see the documentation for your tool: Configure with Ansible Configure with Chef Configure with AWS Elastic Beanstalk Configure with Puppet Update the agent for assisted and manual tarball installs Important Since there are are no automated scripts, old files may remain when you update. Be sure to manually remove outdated files. To update the agent, download the file again and follow the installation procedure for Linux (assisted or manual) or Windows (assisted or manual). This will overwrite your old installation. Update the containerized version of the agent Use the latest label to ensure that our Docker image is automatically updated. Identify outdated agent versions from the UI You can use the Infrastructure monitoring UI to search for outdated agent versions: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Inventory * * * * . In the search bar, type newrelic-infra. Select a group's dropdown to see the agent versions for that group. To manually check the infrastructure agent versions, you can log onto a server and run newrelic-infra --version, or the applicable command for your package manager.",

Similarly, if you disable or uninstall your integrations, the infrastructure agent will remain. To uninstall any of your integrations, follow the procedure corresponding to the type of integration. Cloud integrations AWS You can disable infrastructure AWS integrations and still retain the connection between your AWS account and New Relic. We recommend not to disable your EC2 and EBS integrations because those add important metadata to your infrastructure data. If you want to... Do this Disable one or more AWS service integrations To disable services while keeping your AWS account linked to New Relic: From one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure, select AWS > Manage services. From your Edit AWS account page, clear the checkbox for each active service you want to disable. Save your changes. Disable all AWS integrations To disconnect your AWS account completely from New Relic, you need to unlink your AWS account. This disables all New Relic integrations associated with that AWS account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS > Manage services. From your Edit AWS account page, select Unlink this account. Save your changes. Sign in to AWS and select Services > IAM > Roles. Select the checkbox for the role you want to delete, then select Role Actions > Delete Role. Unlinking your AWS account will disable the trust relationship set up via your ARN. Azure If you want to... Do this Disable one or more Azure service integrations To disable services while keeping your Azure account linked to New Relic: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure > Manage services. From your Edit Azure account page, clear the checkbox for each active service you want to disable. Save your changes. Disable all Azure integrations To disconnect your Azure account completely from New Relic, you need to unlink your Azure account. This requires being either the user who registered the app or an administrator. This procedure will disable all New Relic integrations associated with that Azure account. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Azure > Manage services. From your Edit Azure account page, select Unlink this account. Save your changes. Sign in to Azure and go into All Services > Identity > App registrations, or go to Azure Active Directory service and select App registrations. Find the registered app (the recommended name is NewRelic-Integrations). To see the full list of available apps, select the dropdown menu beside the search field and select All apps. Select the app and, on the panel that opens, select Delete. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) If you want to... Do this Disable one or more GCP service integrations To disable services while keeping your GCP account linked to New Relic: From one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP > Manage services. From your Edit GCP account page, clear the checkbox for each active service you want to disable. Save your changes. Disable all GCP integrations To disconnect your GCP account completely from New Relic, you need to unlink your GCP account. This disables all New Relic integrations associated with that GCP account. If you registered the GCP project using a User account, follow these steps. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP > Manage services. From your Edit GCP account page, select Unlink this account. Save your changes. If you registered the GCP project using a Service account, follow these steps. If you are deleting a custom role, be aware that this role may be used for other purposes besides New Relic access. Sign in to New Relic and go to Infrastructure > Integrations > Google Cloud Platform. For a standard (non-custom) user role, select Manage Services for the account you want to remove. Copy the value of User and save it. OR For a custom user role, go to IAM > admin > Roles, search for the role, select it, and select DELETE. You are now finished and can skip the remaining steps. Standard (non-custom) user role: Sign in to Google Cloud and select the correct project in the Select a project box. From the navigation menu, select IAM & admin > IAM. Search for and select the user value you saved, then select REMOVE. On-host integrations If you used the integrations package, see the integrations package instructions.

Restart StatsD. Moving away from the integrations package While it is still possible to use the integrations package, we recommend removing it completely and working with integrations on an individual basis. The last integration package contains the following versions of the integrations: Apache 1.1.2 Cassandra 2.0.3 MySQL 1.1.5 Nginx 1.0.2 Redis 1.0.1 If you remove the integrations package and want to continue using the related on-host integrations, you will need to install them one by one. To uninstall the package and re-install your integrations: Remove the integrations package by following these instructions.

Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure monitoring agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. Install using configuration management tools To install the infrastructure monitoring agent with a configuration management tool, see the documentation for: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Install for Docker containers on instrumented hosts See Docker instrumentation for infrastructure monitoring. Install using Azure extensions See Azure extensions for infrastructure monitoring. Install using tarball files For custom setup scenarios, you can install the infrastructure monitoring agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual modes. This is especially useful when you need to adapt the default installation settings to your environment, or to install the infrastructure monitoring agent on distributions that lack the newrelic-infra package in their repositories. Important Installing the agent using tarball files is officially supported only for the AWS Graviton 2 processor. Update the agent Follow standard procedures to update the infrastructure monitoring agent. If you are using sudo to install or update the agent, use the -E argument to allow bypassing the environment variables, or specify the NRIA_MODE environment variable just after sudo. export NRIA_MODE=\"SET_MODE_HERE\" Copy OR sudo -E YOUR_PACKAGE_MANAGER_UPDATE_COMMAND Copy What's next? Generate some traffic and wait a few minutes, then view your hosts in the New Relic One UI. If necessary, follow our troubleshooting procedures if no data appears. Important The hostname for your server cannot be localhost. Data will not be reported for servers with that name. Make sure the host name uses a unique name. The only required configuration option is the license_key setting, which is created as part of the installation procedures. You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Enable log forwarding. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services.",

      "body": "New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent is a lightweight executable file that collects data about your hosts. It also forwards data from infrastructure integrations to New Relic, as well as log data for log analytics. There are multiple ways to install and deploy the infrastructure monitoring agent, depending on your setup and needs. This document describes how the infrastructure monitoring agent works and how to install it. Tip To use infrastructure monitoring and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Quick start: Use our guided install The quickest way to get started with our infrastructure monitoring agent is through our guided install. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install not only installs the infrastructure agent, but also discovers the applications and log sources running in your environment. It recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your infrastructure. Important If you install the agent using the New Relic One UI, the Infrastructure status API is enabled by default. One agent, many capabilities Our infrastructure monitoring agent collects performance and health data about the system resources and processes of the host where it's enabled (on-premises or virtualized). At the same time, it acts as a forwarder for two types of data: core services metrics, which are collected by on-host integrations, and logs. If you want to collect data about core services running on your host, you need to install the infrastructure monitoring agent first, and then install or enable on-host integrations. Our infrastructure monitoring agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services. It can also forward logs to New Relic. Backend application metrics (APM) are collected by separate language agents. Notice how each integration and forwarder feed different data types in the New Relic database (NRDB). Install the infrastructure monitoring agent If our guided install doesn't work for your setup, follow the instructions for your Linux, Windows, or other setup. The infrastructure monitoring agent can currently run on many Linux distributions, as well as Windows Server. For more information on where you can run the agent, check the compatibility and requirements page. Linux The preferred way to install the Linux agent is through the package manager of your distribution. Select your distribution from the list for step-by-step instructions. Amazon Linux CentOS Container (Docker) Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Other Linux distros To use these installation links, you must be logged to your New Relic account. If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or if you prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced install needs, you can deploy the agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual mode. Windows Server and 10 To deploy the agent on a Windows Server host, install it using our MSI installer. For a guided procedure, click the button below and follow the step-by-step instructions: Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced installation needs, you can deploy the agent using our zip files in assisted or manual mode. Other installation scenarios The infrastructure monitoring agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Check the source code The infrastructure monitoring agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README. What's next After you've installed the infrastructure monitoring agent: Learn how to configure the agent or edit the config template. Install on-host integrations (for example, for Apache or MySQL).

      "body": "New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent is a lightweight executable file that collects data about your hosts. It also forwards data from infrastructure integrations to New Relic, as well as log data for log analytics. There are multiple ways to install and deploy the infrastructure monitoring agent, depending on your setup and needs. This document describes how the infrastructure monitoring agent works and how to install it. Tip To use infrastructure monitoring and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Quick start: Use our guided install The quickest way to get started with our infrastructure monitoring agent is through our guided install. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install not only installs the infrastructure agent, but also discovers the applications and log sources running in your environment. It recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your infrastructure. Important If you install the agent using the New Relic One UI, the Infrastructure status API is enabled by default. One agent, many capabilities Our infrastructure monitoring agent collects performance and health data about the system resources and processes of the host where it's enabled (on-premises or virtualized). At the same time, it acts as a forwarder for two types of data: core services metrics, which are collected by on-host integrations, and logs. If you want to collect data about core services running on your host, you need to install the infrastructure monitoring agent first, and then install or enable on-host integrations. Our infrastructure monitoring agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services. It can also forward logs to New Relic. Backend application metrics (APM) are collected by separate language agents. Notice how each integration and forwarder feed different data types in the New Relic database (NRDB). Install the infrastructure monitoring agent If our guided install doesn't work for your setup, follow the instructions for your Linux, Windows, or other setup. The infrastructure monitoring agent can currently run on many Linux distributions, as well as Windows Server. For more information on where you can run the agent, check the compatibility and requirements page. Linux The preferred way to install the Linux agent is through the package manager of your distribution. Select your distribution from the list for step-by-step instructions. Amazon Linux CentOS Container (Docker) Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Other Linux distros To use these installation links, you must be logged to your New Relic account. If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or if you prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced install needs, you can deploy the agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual mode. Windows Server and 10 To deploy the agent on a Windows Server host, install it using our MSI installer. For a guided procedure, click the button below and follow the step-by-step instructions: Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced installation needs, you can deploy the agent using our zip files in assisted or manual mode. Other installation scenarios The infrastructure monitoring agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Check the source code The infrastructure monitoring agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README. What's next After you've installed the infrastructure monitoring agent: Learn how to configure the agent or edit the config template. Install on-host integrations (for example, for Apache or MySQL).

      "body": "New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent is a lightweight executable file that collects data about your hosts. It also forwards data from infrastructure integrations to New Relic, as well as log data for log analytics. There are multiple ways to install and deploy the infrastructure monitoring agent, depending on your setup and needs. This document describes how the infrastructure monitoring agent works and how to install it. Tip To use infrastructure monitoring and the rest of our observability platform, join the New Relic family! Sign up to create your free account in only a few seconds. Then ingest up to 100GB of data for free each month. Forever. Quick start: Use our guided install The quickest way to get started with our infrastructure monitoring agent is through our guided install. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install not only installs the infrastructure agent, but also discovers the applications and log sources running in your environment. It recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your infrastructure. Important If you install the agent using the New Relic One UI, the Infrastructure status API is enabled by default. One agent, many capabilities Our infrastructure monitoring agent collects performance and health data about the system resources and processes of the host where it's enabled (on-premises or virtualized). At the same time, it acts as a forwarder for two types of data: core services metrics, which are collected by on-host integrations, and logs. If you want to collect data about core services running on your host, you need to install the infrastructure monitoring agent first, and then install or enable on-host integrations. Our infrastructure monitoring agent and its integrations collect data from the system and core services. It can also forward logs to New Relic. Backend application metrics (APM) are collected by separate language agents. Notice how each integration and forwarder feed different data types in the New Relic database (NRDB). Install the infrastructure monitoring agent If our guided install doesn't work for your setup, follow the instructions for your Linux, Windows, or other setup. The infrastructure monitoring agent can currently run on many Linux distributions, as well as Windows Server. For more information on where you can run the agent, check the compatibility and requirements page. Linux The preferred way to install the Linux agent is through the package manager of your distribution. Select your distribution from the list for step-by-step instructions. Amazon Linux CentOS Container (Docker) Debian RHEL SLES Ubuntu Other Linux distros To use these installation links, you must be logged to your New Relic account. If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or if you prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced install needs, you can deploy the agent using our tarball files in assisted or manual mode. Windows Server and 10 To deploy the agent on a Windows Server host, install it using our MSI installer. For a guided procedure, click the button below and follow the step-by-step instructions: Windows If you don't have a New Relic account yet, or prefer to follow the procedure manually, see our tutorial. For advanced installation needs, you can deploy the agent using our zip files in assisted or manual mode. Other installation scenarios The infrastructure monitoring agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Docker (install as container) Elastic Beanstalk Puppet Check the source code The infrastructure monitoring agent is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README. What's next After you've installed the infrastructure monitoring agent: Learn how to configure the agent or edit the config template. Install on-host integrations (for example, for Apache or MySQL).

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent collects and displays data using six primary events, each with associated attributes that represent assorted metrics and metadata. Understanding infrastructure data can help you: Better understand our infrastructure monitoring UI. Manage your infrastructure data. Create better host filter sets. Run better queries of your data. Set up better monitoring solutions using custom attributes. Infrastructure events The following are events reported by default by the infrastructure agent and some infrastructure integrations. The attributes attached to these events are the metadata and metrics used to create our infrastructure UI visualizations. You can also create custom queries and charts of this data. If you're using integrations, see that integration's doc for more on reported data. For common AWS attributes, see AWS data. Select an event name in the following table to see its attributes. Event Description SystemSample SystemSample contains data describing the current overall state of the entire server, including CPU, memory, disk, and network. We take a snapshot of this data every 5 seconds and package it into a SystemSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears in the Hosts UI page. ProcessSample ProcessSample gathers detailed resource usage information from programs running on a single system. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for every active process and package it into a ProcessSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Processes UI page. Important Process metrics are not sent to New Relic by default for accounts created after July 20, 2020. Enable process metrics to get this data into the Infrastructure monitoring UI. StorageSample StorageSample represents a single storage device associated with a server. Each sample gathers descriptive information about the device, the type of file system it uses, and its current usage and capacity. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for each mounted file system and package it into a StorageSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Storage UI page. Important If your server uses disks with file systems other than the supported file systems in the following table, StorageSample events will not be generated for those disks. Supported Linux storage systems Supported Linux storage file systems: xfs vxfs btrfs ext ext2 ext3 ext4 hfs Supported Windows storage systems Supported Windows storage file systems: NTFS ReFS (version 1.0.976 and higher) NetworkSample NetworkSample captures the descriptive and state information for each network device associated with a server. It includes the device's interface and address information, as well as current usage data. We take a snapshot of this data every 10 seconds for each attached network interface and package it into a NetworkSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Network UI page. ContainerSample ContainerSample collects the descriptive and state information for each Docker container. It includes the container's ID, name, image, image name, as well metrics about CPU, memory and networking. We take a snapshot of this data every 15 seconds for each container and package it into a ContainerSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Containers UI page. For more information, see Docker monitoring. InfrastructureEvent InfrastructureEvent describes changes (deltas) that occur in a system's live state. When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, New Relic will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. This data appears on the Events UI page. To learn about infrastructure integration data, see the documentation for a specific integration. If an AWS integration is enabled, your infrastructure events may also have AWS attributes attached. Query infrastructure data You can query your infrastructure data to troubleshoot a problem or create a chart, or to understand what data is available. For example, to see what data is attached to ProcessSample, you would run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM ProcessSample Copy You can also query infrastructure using dimensional metrics. Manage data For tips on managing data ingest and reporting, see Manage infrastructure data. Add custom attributes You can create custom attributes in the infrastructure agent's YAML file. Use this metadata to: Create infrastructure filter sets Populate the Group by menu Annotate your infrastructure data Common Amazon EC2 attributes If you connect your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) account to our infrastructure monitoring, we report data from your Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon EC2-related attributes are common attributes that can be used in any event. These attributes are drawn from the EC2 API. No CloudWatch information is collected. These attributes and their values are subject to change if Amazon changes the data they expose. awsRegion The region (determined by Amazon Web Services) where the AWS server exists. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. awsAvailabilityZone The availability zone (determined by Amazon Web Services) where the AWS server exists. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2InstanceType The Amazon Web Services instance type, displayed in AWS-specific codes. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2InstanceId The Amazon Web Services instance's unique identifying number for the server. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2AmiId The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) identification number of the image used by Amazon Web Services to bootstrap the Amazon EC2 instance. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2SubnetId The networking sub-net identifier on which the server is connected. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2VpcId The Virtual Private Cloud identifier (if any) for this server. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. Other Amazon EC2 attributes If Amazon Web Services changes the metadata they make available to New Relic, other attributes and values collected also may be available.",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent collects and displays data using six primary events, each with associated attributes that represent assorted metrics and metadata. Understanding infrastructure data can help you: Better understand our infrastructure monitoring UI. Manage your infrastructure data. Create better host filter sets. Run better queries of your data. Set up better monitoring solutions using custom attributes. Infrastructure events The following are events reported by default by the infrastructure agent and some infrastructure integrations. The attributes attached to these events are the metadata and metrics used to create our infrastructure UI visualizations. You can also create custom queries and charts of this data. If you're using integrations, see that integration's doc for more on reported data. For common AWS attributes, see AWS data. Select an event name in the following table to see its attributes. Event Description SystemSample SystemSample contains data describing the current overall state of the entire server, including CPU, memory, disk, and network. We take a snapshot of this data every 5 seconds and package it into a SystemSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears in the Hosts UI page. ProcessSample ProcessSample gathers detailed resource usage information from programs running on a single system. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for every active process and package it into a ProcessSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Processes UI page. Important Process metrics are not sent to New Relic by default for accounts created after July 20, 2020. Enable process metrics to get this data into the Infrastructure monitoring UI. StorageSample StorageSample represents a single storage device associated with a server. Each sample gathers descriptive information about the device, the type of file system it uses, and its current usage and capacity. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for each mounted file system and package it into a StorageSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Storage UI page. Important If your server uses disks with file systems other than the supported file systems in the following table, StorageSample events will not be generated for those disks. Supported Linux storage systems Supported Linux storage file systems: xfs vxfs btrfs ext ext2 ext3 ext4 hfs Supported Windows storage systems Supported Windows storage file systems: NTFS ReFS (version 1.0.976 and higher) NetworkSample NetworkSample captures the descriptive and state information for each network device associated with a server. It includes the device's interface and address information, as well as current usage data. We take a snapshot of this data every 10 seconds for each attached network interface and package it into a NetworkSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Network UI page. ContainerSample ContainerSample collects the descriptive and state information for each Docker container. It includes the container's ID, name, image, image name, as well metrics about CPU, memory and networking. We take a snapshot of this data every 15 seconds for each container and package it into a ContainerSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Containers UI page. For more information, see Docker monitoring. InfrastructureEvent InfrastructureEvent describes changes (deltas) that occur in a system's live state. When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, New Relic will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. This data appears on the Events UI page. To learn about infrastructure integration data, see the documentation for a specific integration. If an AWS integration is enabled, your infrastructure events may also have AWS attributes attached. Query infrastructure data You can query your infrastructure data to troubleshoot a problem or create a chart, or to understand what data is available. For example, to see what data is attached to ProcessSample, you would run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM ProcessSample Copy You can also query infrastructure using dimensional metrics. Manage data For tips on managing data ingest and reporting, see Manage infrastructure data. Add custom attributes You can create custom attributes in the infrastructure agent's YAML file. Use this metadata to: Create infrastructure filter sets Populate the Group by menu Annotate your infrastructure data Common Amazon EC2 attributes If you connect your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) account to our infrastructure monitoring, we report data from your Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon EC2-related attributes are common attributes that can be used in any event. These attributes are drawn from the EC2 API. No CloudWatch information is collected. These attributes and their values are subject to change if Amazon changes the data they expose. awsRegion The region (determined by Amazon Web Services) where the AWS server exists. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. awsAvailabilityZone The availability zone (determined by Amazon Web Services) where the AWS server exists. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2InstanceType The Amazon Web Services instance type, displayed in AWS-specific codes. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2InstanceId The Amazon Web Services instance's unique identifying number for the server. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2AmiId The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) identification number of the image used by Amazon Web Services to bootstrap the Amazon EC2 instance. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2SubnetId The networking sub-net identifier on which the server is connected. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2VpcId The Virtual Private Cloud identifier (if any) for this server. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. Other Amazon EC2 attributes If Amazon Web Services changes the metadata they make available to New Relic, other attributes and values collected also may be available.",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent collects and displays data using six primary events, each with associated attributes that represent assorted metrics and metadata. Understanding infrastructure data can help you: Better understand our infrastructure monitoring UI. Manage your infrastructure data. Create better host filter sets. Run better queries of your data. Set up better monitoring solutions using custom attributes. Infrastructure events The following are events reported by default by the infrastructure agent and some infrastructure integrations. The attributes attached to these events are the metadata and metrics used to create our infrastructure UI visualizations. You can also create custom queries and charts of this data. If you're using integrations, see that integration's doc for more on reported data. For common AWS attributes, see AWS data. Select an event name in the following table to see its attributes. Event Description SystemSample SystemSample contains data describing the current overall state of the entire server, including CPU, memory, disk, and network. We take a snapshot of this data every 5 seconds and package it into a SystemSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears in the Hosts UI page. ProcessSample ProcessSample gathers detailed resource usage information from programs running on a single system. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for every active process and package it into a ProcessSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Processes UI page. Important Process metrics are not sent to New Relic by default for accounts created after July 20, 2020. Enable process metrics to get this data into the Infrastructure monitoring UI. StorageSample StorageSample represents a single storage device associated with a server. Each sample gathers descriptive information about the device, the type of file system it uses, and its current usage and capacity. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for each mounted file system and package it into a StorageSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Storage UI page. Important If your server uses disks with file systems other than the supported file systems in the following table, StorageSample events will not be generated for those disks. Supported Linux storage systems Supported Linux storage file systems: xfs vxfs btrfs ext ext2 ext3 ext4 hfs Supported Windows storage systems Supported Windows storage file systems: NTFS ReFS (version 1.0.976 and higher) NetworkSample NetworkSample captures the descriptive and state information for each network device associated with a server. It includes the device's interface and address information, as well as current usage data. We take a snapshot of this data every 10 seconds for each attached network interface and package it into a NetworkSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Network UI page. ContainerSample ContainerSample collects the descriptive and state information for each Docker container. It includes the container's ID, name, image, image name, as well metrics about CPU, memory and networking. We take a snapshot of this data every 15 seconds for each container and package it into a ContainerSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Containers UI page. For more information, see Docker monitoring. InfrastructureEvent InfrastructureEvent describes changes (deltas) that occur in a system's live state. When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, New Relic will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. This data appears on the Events UI page. To learn about infrastructure integration data, see the documentation for a specific integration. If an AWS integration is enabled, your infrastructure events may also have AWS attributes attached. Query infrastructure data You can query your infrastructure data to troubleshoot a problem or create a chart, or to understand what data is available. For example, to see what data is attached to ProcessSample, you would run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM ProcessSample Copy You can also query infrastructure using dimensional metrics. Manage data For tips on managing data ingest and reporting, see Manage infrastructure data. Add custom attributes You can create custom attributes in the infrastructure agent's YAML file. Use this metadata to: Create infrastructure filter sets Populate the Group by menu Annotate your infrastructure data Common Amazon EC2 attributes If you connect your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) account to our infrastructure monitoring, we report data from your Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon EC2-related attributes are common attributes that can be used in any event. These attributes are drawn from the EC2 API. No CloudWatch information is collected. These attributes and their values are subject to change if Amazon changes the data they expose. awsRegion The region (determined by Amazon Web Services) where the AWS server exists. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. awsAvailabilityZone The availability zone (determined by Amazon Web Services) where the AWS server exists. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2InstanceType The Amazon Web Services instance type, displayed in AWS-specific codes. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2InstanceId The Amazon Web Services instance's unique identifying number for the server. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2AmiId The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) identification number of the image used by Amazon Web Services to bootstrap the Amazon EC2 instance. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2SubnetId The networking sub-net identifier on which the server is connected. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2VpcId The Virtual Private Cloud identifier (if any) for this server. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. Other Amazon EC2 attributes If Amazon Web Services changes the metadata they make available to New Relic, other attributes and values collected also may be available.",

Let's look at how the APM-Infrastructure integration works and how to make use of the shared data. The main ways to find and use APM data in infrastructure monitoring are: View APM charts on Infrastructure monitoring UI pages Filter hosts by application data Switch between Infrastructure and APM Examine APM data in Inventory and Events pages Infrastructure data appears in APM in the host table on the APM Summary page. How to integrate APM and infrastructure data For APM and infrastructure data to be integrated, all of the following must be true: The APM agent and the infrastructure agent must be installed on the same host. Both agents must use the same New Relic license key. They must use the same hostname. If the integration is not working, see Troubleshooting the APM-Infrastructure integration. View APM charts When your APM and infrastructure data is linked, you have access to APM data charts on these Infrastructure monitoring UI pages: Hosts, Network, Storage, and Processes. To switch to different charts: select the dropdown beside a chart's name and choose a new chart. Application-related charts will be near the top. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts: If your APM and Infrastructure data is linked, the charts in Infrastructure monitoring can be changed to show your application data. Filter by application data When your APM and infrastructure data is linked, you can filter displayed host data using Applications: From the host filter, select Applications. Select the application you want to filter on. Tip On the Hosts page, you can also filter by selecting items in the Applications column. Switch between infrastructure and APM When your APM and infrastructure accounts are linked, you can switch over from infrastructure to APM and vice versa for the same selected time range. You can switch from infrastructure to APM from these locations: From the host filter Applications menu On the Hosts page, when selecting applications in the Applications table column. You can switch from APM to infrastructure from the host table on the APM Summary page. APM data in Inventory and Events When your APM and infrastructure data is linked, you can view and filter on application data on the Infrastructure monitoring UI's Inventory page and the Events page. View host data in APM When your APM and infrastructure data is linked, you have more available host data in APM. The APM Summary page contains a table with data about your app's hosts and instances, including: Apdex Response time Throughput Error rate CPU usage Memory You can toggle between a table view or breakout metric details for the individual hosts by selecting View table or Break out each metric by host. For more information on host data on the APM Summary page, see host details. Troubleshoot missing APM data APM/Infrastructure integration should happen automatically if you have both the APM agent and the infrastructure agent installed on the same host(s) and they use the same New Relic license key and have the same hostname set. If you do not see APM data in infrastructure monitoring, see Troubleshooting.",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent collects and displays data using six primary events, each with associated attributes that represent assorted metrics and metadata. Understanding infrastructure data can help you: Better understand our infrastructure monitoring UI. Manage your infrastructure data. Create better host filter sets. Run better queries of your data. Set up better monitoring solutions using custom attributes. Infrastructure events The following are events reported by default by the infrastructure agent and some infrastructure integrations. The attributes attached to these events are the metadata and metrics used to create our infrastructure UI visualizations. You can also create custom queries and charts of this data. If you're using integrations, see that integration's doc for more on reported data. For common AWS attributes, see AWS data. Select an event name in the following table to see its attributes. Event Description SystemSample SystemSample contains data describing the current overall state of the entire server, including CPU, memory, disk, and network. We take a snapshot of this data every 5 seconds and package it into a SystemSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears in the Hosts UI page. ProcessSample ProcessSample gathers detailed resource usage information from programs running on a single system. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for every active process and package it into a ProcessSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Processes UI page. Important Process metrics are not sent to New Relic by default for accounts created after July 20, 2020. Enable process metrics to get this data into the Infrastructure monitoring UI. StorageSample StorageSample represents a single storage device associated with a server. Each sample gathers descriptive information about the device, the type of file system it uses, and its current usage and capacity. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for each mounted file system and package it into a StorageSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Storage UI page. Important If your server uses disks with file systems other than the supported file systems in the following table, StorageSample events will not be generated for those disks. Supported Linux storage systems Supported Linux storage file systems: xfs vxfs btrfs ext ext2 ext3 ext4 hfs Supported Windows storage systems Supported Windows storage file systems: NTFS ReFS (version 1.0.976 and higher) NetworkSample NetworkSample captures the descriptive and state information for each network device associated with a server. It includes the device's interface and address information, as well as current usage data. We take a snapshot of this data every 10 seconds for each attached network interface and package it into a NetworkSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Network UI page. ContainerSample ContainerSample collects the descriptive and state information for each Docker container. It includes the container's ID, name, image, image name, as well metrics about CPU, memory and networking. We take a snapshot of this data every 15 seconds for each container and package it into a ContainerSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Containers UI page. For more information, see Docker monitoring. InfrastructureEvent InfrastructureEvent describes changes (deltas) that occur in a system's live state. When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, New Relic will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. This data appears on the Events UI page. To learn about infrastructure integration data, see the documentation for a specific integration. If an AWS integration is enabled, your infrastructure events may also have AWS attributes attached. Query infrastructure data You can query your infrastructure data to troubleshoot a problem or create a chart, or to understand what data is available. For example, to see what data is attached to ProcessSample, you would run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM ProcessSample Copy You can also query infrastructure using dimensional metrics. Manage data For tips on managing data ingest and reporting, see Manage infrastructure data. Add custom attributes You can create custom attributes in the infrastructure agent's YAML file. Use this metadata to: Create infrastructure filter sets Populate the Group by menu Annotate your infrastructure data Common Amazon EC2 attributes If you connect your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) account to our infrastructure monitoring, we report data from your Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon EC2-related attributes are common attributes that can be used in any event. These attributes are drawn from the EC2 API. No CloudWatch information is collected. These attributes and their values are subject to change if Amazon changes the data they expose. awsRegion The region (determined by Amazon Web Services) where the AWS server exists. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. awsAvailabilityZone The availability zone (determined by Amazon Web Services) where the AWS server exists. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2InstanceType The Amazon Web Services instance type, displayed in AWS-specific codes. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2InstanceId The Amazon Web Services instance's unique identifying number for the server. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2AmiId The Amazon Machine Image (AMI) identification number of the image used by Amazon Web Services to bootstrap the Amazon EC2 instance. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2SubnetId The networking sub-net identifier on which the server is connected. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. ec2VpcId The Virtual Private Cloud identifier (if any) for this server. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. Other Amazon EC2 attributes If Amazon Web Services changes the metadata they make available to New Relic, other attributes and values collected also may be available.",

      "body": "With New Relic infrastructure monitoring, you can combine filters into a filter set to organize hosts based on criteria that matter the most to you. Read on to learn about the benefits, use, and logic of filter sets. Benefits of filter sets You can create filter sets using available attributes or tags. For example, you can organize your infrastructure into categories such as: Regions Operating system versions Hosts associated with Docker containers Test environments You can share filter sets with other people in your account, and you can quickly identify infrastructure problems by checking the color-coded health status of each host in the filter set. Create filter sets The default infrastructure filter set is All hosts, and it serves as a template for you to create filter sets. To create a filter set: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure and click Hosts, Inventory, or Events. If All hosts is not displayed in the left sidebar, open that filter set by selecting Saved filter sets > All hosts. In All hosts, click Filter hosts. In the list, click an item to see a list of values. Click Include or Exclude (see Filter set logic). Click values individually or enter text to match multiple values. Continue adding filters until you have the filter set you want. To name your filter, click the icon, type a name, and click Save. Edit filter sets To change an existing filter set: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure and click Hosts, Inventory, or Events. In the sidebar, click Saved filter sets to open a list. Locate the filter set by scrolling or by entering a search term. Click the filter set to open it. In the sidebar, click an option to update your filter set, and then save. Delete filter sets You can delete any saved filter set except the default All hosts. Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Settings > Filter sets. Click to delete the filter set. Combine filter sets with grouping On some pages you can use Group by to group chart results by specific attributes. For example, on the Hosts page, you can group by awsRegion to display the AWS regions with the highest CPU usage. Grouping applies to the selected filter sets. By combining filter sets with grouping, you can find detailed system information quickly. For an example of using these tools to troubleshoot a problem, see Combining filter sets and grouping. Copy filters from filter set to alerts When you create an alert condition, you can build filters individually, or you can copy all the filters from a filter set into a new alert condition. This is a quick shortcut to populate a new alert condition with some filters. Important When you copy filter set filters to a new alert condition, these filters are no longer tied to the filter set. If you make changes to the filter set, the alert filters are not affected. To copy filter set filters to a new alert condition: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure and click Hosts, Inventory, or Events. In the sidebar, click Saved filter sets to open a list. Locate the filter set by scrolling or by entering a search term. Click the filter set to open it. Mouse over any chart and click > Create alert. Enter an alert condition name. Make adjustments to filters as necessary. Complete the remaining alert fields (see Create alert conditions). Filter set logic When you create a filter set, you generate a list of attributes and/or tags that narrow the results. This section explains how filter sets apply various rules to the list. Inclusion and exclusion As part of building a filter set, you designate whether a filter should include or exclude entities that match certain values. The way the inclusion or exclusion works depends on how you select values: Recommended: Select values by matching a string You can generate a list of values by entering a string that you want values to match. This is useful for matching multiple values. Tip String matching efficiently generates a list of values, and this approach scales as you add new entities. Here is the logic filter sets use with string matching: Comparator Logic Include If you click Include and then enter a string that you want values to match, the filter uses the comparator LIKE, which means the results include any entities that are like the string. For example, you could filter by the term East-, and all entities that contain that term are returned. Exclude If you click Exclude and then enter a string that you want values to match, the filter uses the comparator NOT LIKE, which means the results exclude any entities that are like the string. For example, you could filter by the term West-, and all entities that do not contain that term are returned. Select values individually You can click through the list of attributes/tags to identify individual values. Tip This approach does not scale well if you add new entities. Here is the logic filter sets use with individual value selection: Comparator Logic Include If you click Include and then click specific values, the filter uses the comparator IN, which means the filter looks for entities that exactly match one or more values in your list of selections. Exclude If you click Exclude and then click specific values, the filter set uses the comparator NOT IN, which means the filter returns all entities that do not exactly match one or more values in your list of selections. And/Or Filter sets use the logical operators AND and OR behind the scenes to join the data. Here are the rules for AND and OR: When you click values from multiple attributes or tags, they are joined by AND. When you click values from within an attribute or tags, they are joined by OR. The filter results display hosts for which both of the following are true: Hosts containing any one of the selected infrastructure agent versions Hosts in any one of the selected AWS availability zones",

      "body": "Important As of April 12, 2021, we are upgrading Insights to an improved web and mobile experience! All of your Insights URLs will be redirected automatically to the corresponding dashboards in New Relic One. For more details about this migration and how you can easily plan for this transition, see our Explorers Hub post. New Relic's infrastructure monitoring agent collects and displays data using six primary events, each with associated attributes that represent assorted metrics and metadata. Understanding infrastructure data can help you: Better understand our infrastructure monitoring UI. Manage your infrastructure data. Create better host filter sets. Run better queries of your data. Set up better monitoring solutions using custom attributes. Infrastructure events The following are events reported by default by the infrastructure agent and some infrastructure integrations. The attributes attached to these events are the metadata and metrics used to create our infrastructure UI visualizations. You can also create custom queries and charts of this data. If you're using integrations, see that integration's doc for more on reported data. For common AWS attributes, see AWS data. Select an event name in the following table to see its attributes. Event Description SystemSample SystemSample contains data describing the current overall state of the entire server, including CPU, memory, disk, and network. We take a snapshot of this data every 5 seconds and package it into a SystemSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears in the Hosts UI page. ProcessSample ProcessSample gathers detailed resource usage information from programs running on a single system. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for every active process and package it into a ProcessSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Processes UI page. Important Process metrics are not sent to New Relic by default for accounts created after July 20, 2020. Enable process metrics to get this data into the Infrastructure monitoring UI. StorageSample StorageSample represents a single storage device associated with a server. Each sample gathers descriptive information about the device, the type of file system it uses, and its current usage and capacity. We take a snapshot of this data every 20 seconds for each mounted file system and package it into a StorageSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Storage UI page. Important If your server uses disks with file systems other than the supported file systems in the following table, StorageSample events will not be generated for those disks. Supported Linux storage systems Supported Linux storage file systems: xfs vxfs btrfs ext ext2 ext3 ext4 hfs Supported Windows storage systems Supported Windows storage file systems: NTFS ReFS (version 1.0.976 and higher) NetworkSample NetworkSample captures the descriptive and state information for each network device associated with a server. It includes the device's interface and address information, as well as current usage data. We take a snapshot of this data every 10 seconds for each attached network interface and package it into a NetworkSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Network UI page. ContainerSample ContainerSample collects the descriptive and state information for each Docker container. It includes the container's ID, name, image, image name, as well metrics about CPU, memory and networking. We take a snapshot of this data every 15 seconds for each container and package it into a ContainerSample event, which is then sent to New Relic. This data appears on the Containers UI page. For more information, see Docker monitoring. InfrastructureEvent InfrastructureEvent describes changes (deltas) that occur in a system's live state. When an inventory or system state is added, removed, or changed, New Relic will produce an InfrastructureEvent that logs that activity. This data appears on the Events UI page. To learn about infrastructure integration data, see the documentation for a specific integration. If an AWS integration is enabled, your infrastructure events may also have AWS attributes attached. Query infrastructure data You can query your infrastructure data to troubleshoot a problem or create a chart, or to understand what data is available. For example, to see what data is attached to ProcessSample, you would run this NRQL query: SELECT * FROM ProcessSample Copy You can also query infrastructure using dimensional metrics. Manage data For tips on managing data ingest and reporting, see Manage infrastructure data. Add custom attributes You can create custom attributes in the infrastructure agent's YAML file. Use this metadata to: Create infrastructure filter sets Populate the Group by menu Annotate your infrastructure data Common Amazon EC2 attributes If you connect your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) account to our infrastructure monitoring, we report data from your Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon EC2-related attributes are common attributes that can be used in any event. These attributes are drawn from the EC2 API. No CloudWatch information is collected. These attributes and their values are subject to change if Amazon changes the data they expose. awsRegion The region (determined by Amazon Web Services) where the AWS server exists. This attribute exists only for customers using New Relic to monitor Amazon EC2 servers. awsAvailabilityZone The availability zone (determined by Amazon Web Services) where the AWS server exists.

      "body": "Use Infrastructure monitoring's Host not reporting condition to notify you when we've stopped receiving data from an infrastructure agent. This feature allows you to dynamically alert on groups of hosts, configure the time window from five to 60 minutes, and take full advantage of alerts notifications. Features You can define conditions based on the sets of hosts most important to you, and configure thresholds appropriate for each filter set. The Host not reporting event triggers when data from the infrastructure agent doesn't reach our collector within the time frame you specify. Caution If you have filtered your Host Not Reporting condition using tags or labels and then remove a critical tag or label from a targeted host, the system will open a Host Not Reporting violation, since it will characterize that host as having lost its connection. This feature's flexibility allows you to easily customize what to monitor and when to notify selected individuals or teams. In addition, the email notification includes links to help you quickly troubleshoot the situation. Host not reporting condition Features What to monitor You can use filter sets to select which hosts you want to be monitored with the alert condition. The condition will also automatically apply to any hosts you add in the future that match these filters. How to notify Conditions are contained in policies. You can select an existing policy or create a new policy with email notifications from the Infrastructure monitoring UI. If you want to create a new policy with other types of notification channels, use the UI. When to notify Email addresses (identified in the policy) will be notified automatically about threshold violations for any host matching the filters you have applied, depending on the policy's incident preferences. Where to troubleshoot The link at the top of the email notification will take you to the infrastructure Events page centered on the time when the host disconnected. Additional links in the email will take you to additional detail. Create \"host not reporting\" condition To define the Host not reporting condition criteria: Follow standard procedures to create an infrastructure condition. Select Host not reporting as the Alert type. Define the Critical threshold for triggering the notification: minimum 5 minutes, maximum 60 minutes. Enable 'Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown' option, if you want to prevent false alerts when you have hosts set to shut down via command line. Currently this feature is supported on all Windows systems and Linux systems using systemd. Depending on the policy's incident preferences, it will define which notification channels to use when the defined Critical threshold for the condition passes. To avoid \"false positives,\" the host must stop reporting for the entire time period before a violation is opened. Example: You create a condition to open a violation when any of the filtered set of hosts stop reporting data for seven minutes. If any host stops reporting for five minutes, then resumes reporting, the condition does not open a violation. If any host stops reporting for seven minutes, even if the others are fine, the condition does open a violation. Investigate the problem To further investigate why a host is not reporting data: Review the details in the email notification. Use the link from the email notification to monitor ongoing changes in your environment from Infrastructure monitoring's Events page. For example, use the Events page to help determine if a host disconnected right after a root user made a configuration change to the host. Optional: Use the email notification's Acknowledge link to verify you are aware of and taking ownership of the alerting incident. Use the email links to examine additional details in the Incident details page. Intentional outages We can distinguish between unexpected situations and planned situations with the option Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown. Use this option for situations such as: Host has been taken offline intentionally. Host has planned downtime for maintenance. Host has been shut down or decommissioned. Autoscaling hosts or shutting down instances in a cloud console. We rely on Linux and Windows shutdown signals to flag a clean shutdown. We've confirmed that these scenarios are detected by the agent: AWS Auto-scaling event with EC2 instances that use systemd (Amazon Linux, CentOs/RedHat 7 and newer, Ubuntu 16 and newer, Suse 12 and newer, Debian 9 and newer) User-initiated shutdown of Windows systems User-initiated shutdown of Linux systems that use systemd (Amazon Linux, CentOs/RedHat 7 and newer, Ubuntu 16 and newer, Suse 12 and newer, Debian 9 and newer) We know that these scenarios are not detected by the agent: User-initiated shutdown of Linux systems that don't use systemd (CentOs/RedHat 6 and earlier, Ubuntu 14, Debian 8). This includes other modern Linux systems that still use Upstart or SysV init systems.

      "body": "Use the infrastructure REST API to add, update, delete, and list alerting conditions. You can also manage individual alerting conditions using the infrastructure monitoring UI. REST API calls for infrastructure alerts are not available in the API Explorer. Why use the API Examples Consistency Define the same set of conditions for every cluster without having to set up identical conditions in the Infrastructure monitoring UI each time. Manage multiple conditions quickly, without having to update them one by one using the UI. Flexibility Create conditions for an arbitrary group of hosts. Disable or delete conditions for hosts taken offline anytime. Create a condition with exclusionary filtering (for instance, environment NOT LIKE x). For more on this, see this post on exclusion filtering. For AWS Cloud integrations, select attributes that haven't been sent up by AWS yet. Create compound alert conditions by using the where_clause, which allows you to specify the limits on a secondary or tertiary metric. Exceed the 500-facet limitation on NRQL alert conditions. Reliability Audit when a condition was last updated. Requirements In order to use the Infrastructure REST API, you need: An API key The alerting condition's related policy_id from New Relic, available via GET list of conditions or via the Alerts REST API The condition id, available via GET list of conditions, or via the condition's URL in the Infrastructure monitoring UI Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, make sure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Using infrastructure API calls Here are some basic cURL commands and their responses for Infrastructure alert conditions. Depending on the type of condition, the DATA information you provide in the call will vary for POST (add) and PUT (update) calls. Definitions of each attribute used in the data blocks can be found in the Definitions section. GET infrastructure conditions You can either GET a list of infrastructure conditions or GET a specific infrastructure condition. Here are a few tips for listing infrastructure conditions. For pagination, use limit (records per page) and offset (how many records to skip) parameters. Default is 50 records per page, and offset starts at 0 (skip no records). To scope the results to a specific policy, use policy_id. Tip If you want to use the GET response as a template for your PUT or POST input, be sure to remove the created_at_epoch_millis, updated_at_epoch_millis and id information. GET a list of infrastructure conditions curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions?policy_id=111111\" Copy Example GET a list of conditions Response showing 2 of the 3 conditions for the example policy (formatted for readability and truncated): HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 622 Content-Type: application/json { \"data\":[ { \"type\":\"infra_process_running\", \"name\":\"Java is running\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(`hostname` LIKE '%cassandra%')\", \"id\":13890, \"created_at_epoch_millis\":1490996713872, \"updated_at_epoch_millis\":1490996713872, \"policy_id\":111111, \"comparison\":\"equal\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":0, \"duration_minutes\":6 }, \"process_where_clause\":\"(`commandName` = 'java')\" }, { \"created_at_epoch_millis\": 1501704525462, \"critical_threshold\": { \"duration_minutes\": 5 }, \"enabled\": true, \"filter\": { \"and\": [ { \"like\": { \"fullHostname\": \"Production_1\" } } ] }, \"id\": 448036, \"name\": \"PROD - Host Machine's Agent Not Responding ....\", \"policy_id\": 98485, \"type\": \"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"updated_at_epoch_millis\": 1504879191220 } . . . ], \"meta\":{ \"limit\":50, \"offset\":0, \"total\":3 }, \"links\":{} } Copy To get a list of the 10 Infrastructure conditions beyond the 50 limit: curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions?policy_id=111111&offset=50&list=10\" Copy GET a specific infrastructure condition To get information about a single Infrastructure condition: curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions/condition-id\" Copy Example GET a specific condition Response (formatted for readability): HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 246 Content-Type: application/json { \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"name\":\"demo condition\", \"enabled\":false, \"id\":13887, \"created_at_epoch_millis\":1490981583580, \"updated_at_epoch_millis\":1490981583580, \"policy_id\":23635, \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":100 } } } Copy Create (POST) an infrastructure condition Important Do not include an \"id\": when adding a new condition (POST). It will be generated when the condition is created. To add an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"data\":{DATA object details}}' Copy Include details in the DATA object (-d \\ section) for the type of infrastructure condition you are adding: Process running conditions API data Metric conditions API data Host not reporting conditions API data Update (PUT) an infrastructure condition You only need to include the fields that need to be changed when updating an infrastructure condition. The API keeps the existing values for any missing fields. Important If you want to change the condition type, do not use PUT. Instead, delete the existing condition, then add (POST) a new condition with the new condition type and all fields. To update an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command. To indicate which condition is to be updated, be sure to include the \"id\": . Example update (PUT) a condition curl -X PUT 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions/condition-id' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"data\":{DATA object details}}' Copy Include details in the DATA object (-d \\ section) for the type of infrastructure condition you are updating: Process running conditions API data Metric conditions API data Host not reporting conditions API data Remove (DELETE) an infrastructure condition To delete an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command: curl -v -X DELETE --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions/condition_id\" Copy Types of conditions Process running conditions API data A process running condition alerts you when the number of processes is above, below, or equal to the threshold you define. To add (POST) or update (PUT) a process running condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. Example condition types For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_process_running\", \"name\":\"Java is running\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"comparison\":\"equal\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":0, \"duration_minutes\":6 }, \"process_where_clause\":\"(commandName = '\\''java'\\'')\" } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause and process_where_clause Metric conditions API data A metric condition alerts you when the metric of your choice is above, below, or equal to the threshold you define. This includes: System metrics Process metrics Network metrics Storage metrics Cloud integration metrics To add (POST) or update (PUT) a metric condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. If you are adding or updating a cloud integration alert condition: For the event_type field, enter the event type generated by your selected cloud integration service (for example, ComputeSample for the AWS EC2 integration). If you are setting up an alert condition on a cloud integration service that requires a provider value (for example, AWS RDS uses DatastoreSample with a provider value of RdsDbInstance or RdsDbCluster), you will need to add the \"integration_provider\" field and use the value that is appropriate for the service your alert condition is targeting (for example, \"integration_provider\":\"RdsDbInstance\"). For the select_value field, build the metric name by using the following syntax, where provider is a standard prefix string: provider.metric.aggregation_type Copy metric: Use the metric name as described in the New Relic documentation for your integration. aggregation_type: Use Sum, Average, Minimum, or Maximum. Refer to the original documentation by the integration's cloud provider to see which statistic aggregations are available for each metric. Example For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_metric\", \"name\":\"Disk Space Condition\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"event_type\":\"StorageSample\", \"select_value\":\"diskFreePercent\", \"comparison\":\"below\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":10, \"duration_minutes\":1, \"time_function\":\"any\" }, \"warning_threshold\":{ \"value\":30, \"duration_minutes\":2, \"time_function\":\"any\" } } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause Host not reporting condition A host not reporting condition alerts you when a host stops reporting. To add (POST) or update (PUT) a host not reporting condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. Example For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"name\":\"Cassandra Host Reporting Condition\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":12 } } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause Definitions When formatting your cURL commands, use these values as needed. These are listed in alphabetical order, not the order they appear in your API calls. Field Definition comparison (enum) Condition type: infra_metric, infra_process_running The value used to define the threshold; for example, \"[\"above\", \"below\", \"equal\"]. critical_threshold and warning_threshold Condition type: all This object identifies the threshold value before opening a violation. The critical_threshold is required. The warning_threshold is optional and may only be used with infra_metric conditions. The keys of this object depend on the condition type. Condition type: infra_metric format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":<number>, \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, \"time_function\":\"any\" or \"all\" }, Copy Condition type: infra_process_running format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":<integer>, \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, }, Copy Condition type: infra_host_not_reporting format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, }, Copy value The numeric value that must be breached for the condition to open a violation duration_minutes The number of minutes the value must be passed or met for the condition to open a violation time_function Indicates if the condition needs to be sustained for a certain period of time to create a violation, or if it only needs to break the threshold once within a certain period of time. If you're setting up a for at least x minutes threshold, use all; for an at least once in x minutes threshold, use any. enabled (boolean) Condition type: all Whether the condition is turned on or off; true or false. event_type (string) Condition type: infra_metric The metric event; for example, system metrics, process metrics, storage metrics, or network metrics. This automatically populates for infrastructure integrations; for example, StorageSample or SystemSample. filter (string) Condition type: all If the condition was made in the UI, filter appears instead of where_clause; for example: {and: [{is: {ec2InstanceType: \"m3.medium\"}}]} Copy Recommendation: Use where_clause when creating a new condition. id (integer) Condition type: all The condition ID located in the URL. GET: This value appears in the GET response. PUT: Include this value in the DATA section. POST: Do not include this in the DATA section. DELETE: Include this value in the -X DELETE call. integration_provider (string) Condition type: infra_metric For alerts on integrations, use integration_provider instead of event_type. To see valid values: From the New Relic documentation for your cloud service, check the Find and use data section. Example: In the AWS RDS monitoring integration documentation, you can see that the DatastoreSample event type can be used with an integration_provider value of either RdsDbInstance for DB instances, or RdsDbCluster for Aurora DB clusters. name (string) Condition type: all The infrastructure alerting condition's name; for example: \"[test] process running\" Copy policy_id (integer) Condition type: all The unique ID for the alert policy's account ID associated with the condition; for example, 1234567890. This is not the policy's global ID. process_where_clause (string) Condition type: infra_process_running Any filters applied to processes, specifically in process running alert conditions. This parameter is mandatory for those types of alert conditions. For example: \"commandName = '\\''java'\\''\" Copy runbook_url (string) Condition type: all The runbook URL to display in notifications. select_value (string) Condition type: infra_metric The attribute name to identify the metric being targeted; for example, \"cpuPercent\", \"diskFreePercent\", \"memoryResidentSizeBytes\", or \"memoryFreeBytes/memoryTotalBytes*100\". This automatically populates for Infrastructure Integrations; for example, diskFreePercent. type (enum) Condition type: all The type of infrastructure alert condition: \"infra_process_running\", \"infra_metric\", or \"infra_host_not_reporting\". violation_close_timer (integer) Condition type: all The Violation time limit setting, expressed as hours. Possible values are 0, 1, 2, 4, 8,12, 24, 48, 72. This determines how much time will pass before a violation is automatically closed. Setting the time limit to 0 prevents a violation from being force-closed. For new conditions, if a value is not provided, the following default values are used: Host Not Responding (HNR) conditions: 0 (disabled) All other conditions: 24 When updating existing conditions, if a value is provided, it overrides the existing value, but does not affect already opened violations. where_clause (string) Condition type: all If applicable, this identifies any infrastructure host filters used; for example: \"(`hostname` LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", Copy",

      "body": "The Alert type field in infrastructure monitoring's Settings > Alerts page shows what options you can select to create infrastructure alert conditions. You can also create alert conditions from any infrastructure chart by selecting the ellipses icon and then Create alert. Examples: Infrastructure pages Here are some examples of how to create alert conditions within the context of the Infrastructure monitoring UI page you are currently viewing. To create an alerts condition from any chart, select the ellipses icon and then Create alert. New Relic will automatically select the appropriate Alert type. Example Problem and solution High CPU usage Problem: Your Ops team monitors a filtered set of host clusters in your eastern region and notices that the CPU usage is constantly high. Solution: Use the CPU chart on Infrastructure monitoring's Hosts page to create an alert condition for system metrics. Virtual memory capacity Problem: Your night shift needs to be alerted when virtual memory for a set of background workers reaches an average of 10G for at least two minutes. Solution: Use the Top memory consumers chart on Infrastructure monitoring's Processes page to create an alert condition for process metrics. Limited bandwidth Problem: You want to monitor performance based on the average number of errors received or transmitted. Solution: Use the Top bandwidth chart on Infrastructure monitoring's Network page to create an alert condition for network metrics. I/O read and write operations Problem: You are testing a new set of hosts in your staging environment, and you want to be notified when their read or write capacity rises above your test threshold level. Solution: Use the Top I/O operations chart on Infrastructure monitoring's Storage page to create an alert condition for storage metrics. Host not reporting Problem: You want to be notified when we have stopped receiving data from an infrastructure agent. Solution: From the Hosts, Processes, Network, or Storage pages, create a host not reporting alert condition. Processes not running as expected Problem: You want to be notified if any of the processes on your hosts stop reporting. OR A process you expected to start on a host (such as a new program) is not actually running. Solution: From the Processes page (or from the Hosts, Network, or Storage pages), create a process running alert condition. Examples: Threshold options Use the thresholds dropdown for the selected Alert type to further define how you want to be alerted. Here are some examples of the options available. Integrations providers With infrastructure integrations, you can create an alert condition from your Integrations page. Depending on the type of provider selected (CloudFront, DynamoDB, EBS, etc.), options will vary from the Define thresholds dropdown; for example, bytes, errors, requests, CPU, connections, memory, records, latency, etc. CPU, disk, load average, memory, swap The System metrics thresholds dropdown allows you to select various criteria for CPU, disk, load average, memory, and swap metrics. Byte size The Network metrics thresholds provide flexibility with your business needs. Depending on the size of your network, you can easily set the threshold in bytes, KB, MB, GB, or TB.",

      "body": "Use Infrastructure monitoring's Host not reporting condition to notify you when we've stopped receiving data from an infrastructure agent. This feature allows you to dynamically alert on groups of hosts, configure the time window from five to 60 minutes, and take full advantage of alerts notifications. Features You can define conditions based on the sets of hosts most important to you, and configure thresholds appropriate for each filter set. The Host not reporting event triggers when data from the infrastructure agent doesn't reach our collector within the time frame you specify. Caution If you have filtered your Host Not Reporting condition using tags or labels and then remove a critical tag or label from a targeted host, the system will open a Host Not Reporting violation, since it will characterize that host as having lost its connection. This feature's flexibility allows you to easily customize what to monitor and when to notify selected individuals or teams. In addition, the email notification includes links to help you quickly troubleshoot the situation. Host not reporting condition Features What to monitor You can use filter sets to select which hosts you want to be monitored with the alert condition. The condition will also automatically apply to any hosts you add in the future that match these filters. How to notify Conditions are contained in policies. You can select an existing policy or create a new policy with email notifications from the Infrastructure monitoring UI. If you want to create a new policy with other types of notification channels, use the UI. When to notify Email addresses (identified in the policy) will be notified automatically about threshold violations for any host matching the filters you have applied, depending on the policy's incident preferences. Where to troubleshoot The link at the top of the email notification will take you to the infrastructure Events page centered on the time when the host disconnected. Additional links in the email will take you to additional detail. Create \"host not reporting\" condition To define the Host not reporting condition criteria: Follow standard procedures to create an infrastructure condition. Select Host not reporting as the Alert type. Define the Critical threshold for triggering the notification: minimum 5 minutes, maximum 60 minutes. Enable 'Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown' option, if you want to prevent false alerts when you have hosts set to shut down via command line. Currently this feature is supported on all Windows systems and Linux systems using systemd. Depending on the policy's incident preferences, it will define which notification channels to use when the defined Critical threshold for the condition passes. To avoid \"false positives,\" the host must stop reporting for the entire time period before a violation is opened. Example: You create a condition to open a violation when any of the filtered set of hosts stop reporting data for seven minutes. If any host stops reporting for five minutes, then resumes reporting, the condition does not open a violation. If any host stops reporting for seven minutes, even if the others are fine, the condition does open a violation. Investigate the problem To further investigate why a host is not reporting data: Review the details in the email notification. Use the link from the email notification to monitor ongoing changes in your environment from Infrastructure monitoring's Events page. For example, use the Events page to help determine if a host disconnected right after a root user made a configuration change to the host. Optional: Use the email notification's Acknowledge link to verify you are aware of and taking ownership of the alerting incident. Use the email links to examine additional details in the Incident details page. Intentional outages We can distinguish between unexpected situations and planned situations with the option Don't trigger alerts for hosts that perform a clean shutdown. Use this option for situations such as: Host has been taken offline intentionally. Host has planned downtime for maintenance. Host has been shut down or decommissioned. Autoscaling hosts or shutting down instances in a cloud console. We rely on Linux and Windows shutdown signals to flag a clean shutdown. We've confirmed that these scenarios are detected by the agent: AWS Auto-scaling event with EC2 instances that use systemd (Amazon Linux, CentOs/RedHat 7 and newer, Ubuntu 16 and newer, Suse 12 and newer, Debian 9 and newer) User-initiated shutdown of Windows systems User-initiated shutdown of Linux systems that use systemd (Amazon Linux, CentOs/RedHat 7 and newer, Ubuntu 16 and newer, Suse 12 and newer, Debian 9 and newer) We know that these scenarios are not detected by the agent: User-initiated shutdown of Linux systems that don't use systemd (CentOs/RedHat 6 and earlier, Ubuntu 14, Debian 8). This includes other modern Linux systems that still use Upstart or SysV init systems.

      "body": "Use the infrastructure REST API to add, update, delete, and list alerting conditions. You can also manage individual alerting conditions using the infrastructure monitoring UI. REST API calls for infrastructure alerts are not available in the API Explorer. Why use the API Examples Consistency Define the same set of conditions for every cluster without having to set up identical conditions in the Infrastructure monitoring UI each time. Manage multiple conditions quickly, without having to update them one by one using the UI. Flexibility Create conditions for an arbitrary group of hosts. Disable or delete conditions for hosts taken offline anytime. Create a condition with exclusionary filtering (for instance, environment NOT LIKE x). For more on this, see this post on exclusion filtering. For AWS Cloud integrations, select attributes that haven't been sent up by AWS yet. Create compound alert conditions by using the where_clause, which allows you to specify the limits on a secondary or tertiary metric. Exceed the 500-facet limitation on NRQL alert conditions. Reliability Audit when a condition was last updated. Requirements In order to use the Infrastructure REST API, you need: An API key The alerting condition's related policy_id from New Relic, available via GET list of conditions or via the Alerts REST API The condition id, available via GET list of conditions, or via the condition's URL in the Infrastructure monitoring UI Tip If your account hosts data in the EU data center, make sure you are using the proper API endpoints for EU region accounts. Using infrastructure API calls Here are some basic cURL commands and their responses for Infrastructure alert conditions. Depending on the type of condition, the DATA information you provide in the call will vary for POST (add) and PUT (update) calls. Definitions of each attribute used in the data blocks can be found in the Definitions section. GET infrastructure conditions You can either GET a list of infrastructure conditions or GET a specific infrastructure condition. Here are a few tips for listing infrastructure conditions. For pagination, use limit (records per page) and offset (how many records to skip) parameters. Default is 50 records per page, and offset starts at 0 (skip no records). To scope the results to a specific policy, use policy_id. Tip If you want to use the GET response as a template for your PUT or POST input, be sure to remove the created_at_epoch_millis, updated_at_epoch_millis and id information. GET a list of infrastructure conditions curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions?policy_id=111111\" Copy Example GET a list of conditions Response showing 2 of the 3 conditions for the example policy (formatted for readability and truncated): HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 622 Content-Type: application/json { \"data\":[ { \"type\":\"infra_process_running\", \"name\":\"Java is running\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(`hostname` LIKE '%cassandra%')\", \"id\":13890, \"created_at_epoch_millis\":1490996713872, \"updated_at_epoch_millis\":1490996713872, \"policy_id\":111111, \"comparison\":\"equal\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":0, \"duration_minutes\":6 }, \"process_where_clause\":\"(`commandName` = 'java')\" }, { \"created_at_epoch_millis\": 1501704525462, \"critical_threshold\": { \"duration_minutes\": 5 }, \"enabled\": true, \"filter\": { \"and\": [ { \"like\": { \"fullHostname\": \"Production_1\" } } ] }, \"id\": 448036, \"name\": \"PROD - Host Machine's Agent Not Responding ....\", \"policy_id\": 98485, \"type\": \"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"updated_at_epoch_millis\": 1504879191220 } . . . ], \"meta\":{ \"limit\":50, \"offset\":0, \"total\":3 }, \"links\":{} } Copy To get a list of the 10 Infrastructure conditions beyond the 50 limit: curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions?policy_id=111111&offset=50&list=10\" Copy GET a specific infrastructure condition To get information about a single Infrastructure condition: curl -v -X GET --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions/condition-id\" Copy Example GET a specific condition Response (formatted for readability): HTTP/1.1 200 OK Content-Length: 246 Content-Type: application/json { \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"name\":\"demo condition\", \"enabled\":false, \"id\":13887, \"created_at_epoch_millis\":1490981583580, \"updated_at_epoch_millis\":1490981583580, \"policy_id\":23635, \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":100 } } } Copy Create (POST) an infrastructure condition Important Do not include an \"id\": when adding a new condition (POST). It will be generated when the condition is created. To add an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"data\":{DATA object details}}' Copy Include details in the DATA object (-d \\ section) for the type of infrastructure condition you are adding: Process running conditions API data Metric conditions API data Host not reporting conditions API data Update (PUT) an infrastructure condition You only need to include the fields that need to be changed when updating an infrastructure condition. The API keeps the existing values for any missing fields. Important If you want to change the condition type, do not use PUT. Instead, delete the existing condition, then add (POST) a new condition with the new condition type and all fields. To update an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command. To indicate which condition is to be updated, be sure to include the \"id\": . Example update (PUT) a condition curl -X PUT 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions/condition-id' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"data\":{DATA object details}}' Copy Include details in the DATA object (-d \\ section) for the type of infrastructure condition you are updating: Process running conditions API data Metric conditions API data Host not reporting conditions API data Remove (DELETE) an infrastructure condition To delete an infrastructure condition, use this basic cURL command: curl -v -X DELETE --header \"Api-Key: $API_KEY\" \"https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions/condition_id\" Copy Types of conditions Process running conditions API data A process running condition alerts you when the number of processes is above, below, or equal to the threshold you define. To add (POST) or update (PUT) a process running condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. Example condition types For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_process_running\", \"name\":\"Java is running\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"comparison\":\"equal\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":0, \"duration_minutes\":6 }, \"process_where_clause\":\"(commandName = '\\''java'\\'')\" } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause and process_where_clause Metric conditions API data A metric condition alerts you when the metric of your choice is above, below, or equal to the threshold you define. This includes: System metrics Process metrics Network metrics Storage metrics Cloud integration metrics To add (POST) or update (PUT) a metric condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. If you are adding or updating a cloud integration alert condition: For the event_type field, enter the event type generated by your selected cloud integration service (for example, ComputeSample for the AWS EC2 integration). If you are setting up an alert condition on a cloud integration service that requires a provider value (for example, AWS RDS uses DatastoreSample with a provider value of RdsDbInstance or RdsDbCluster), you will need to add the \"integration_provider\" field and use the value that is appropriate for the service your alert condition is targeting (for example, \"integration_provider\":\"RdsDbInstance\"). For the select_value field, build the metric name by using the following syntax, where provider is a standard prefix string: provider.metric.aggregation_type Copy metric: Use the metric name as described in the New Relic documentation for your integration. aggregation_type: Use Sum, Average, Minimum, or Maximum. Refer to the original documentation by the integration's cloud provider to see which statistic aggregations are available for each metric. Example For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_metric\", \"name\":\"Disk Space Condition\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"event_type\":\"StorageSample\", \"select_value\":\"diskFreePercent\", \"comparison\":\"below\", \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":10, \"duration_minutes\":1, \"time_function\":\"any\" }, \"warning_threshold\":{ \"value\":30, \"duration_minutes\":2, \"time_function\":\"any\" } } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause Host not reporting condition A host not reporting condition alerts you when a host stops reporting. To add (POST) or update (PUT) a host not reporting condition, use your API key, and refer to the definitions to customize your values in the API call. Example For example: curl -X POST 'https://infra-api.newrelic.com/v2/alerts/conditions' -H 'Api-Key:$API_KEY' -i -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{ \"data\":{ \"type\":\"infra_host_not_reporting\", \"name\":\"Cassandra Host Reporting Condition\", \"enabled\":true, \"where_clause\":\"(hostname LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", \"policy_id\":policy_id, \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":12 } } }' Copy Important Note the extra single quotes escaping the single quote around the where_clause Definitions When formatting your cURL commands, use these values as needed. These are listed in alphabetical order, not the order they appear in your API calls. Field Definition comparison (enum) Condition type: infra_metric, infra_process_running The value used to define the threshold; for example, \"[\"above\", \"below\", \"equal\"]. critical_threshold and warning_threshold Condition type: all This object identifies the threshold value before opening a violation. The critical_threshold is required. The warning_threshold is optional and may only be used with infra_metric conditions. The keys of this object depend on the condition type. Condition type: infra_metric format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":<number>, \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, \"time_function\":\"any\" or \"all\" }, Copy Condition type: infra_process_running format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"value\":<integer>, \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, }, Copy Condition type: infra_host_not_reporting format: \"critical_threshold\":{ \"duration_minutes\":<integer>, }, Copy value The numeric value that must be breached for the condition to open a violation duration_minutes The number of minutes the value must be passed or met for the condition to open a violation time_function Indicates if the condition needs to be sustained for a certain period of time to create a violation, or if it only needs to break the threshold once within a certain period of time. If you're setting up a for at least x minutes threshold, use all; for an at least once in x minutes threshold, use any. enabled (boolean) Condition type: all Whether the condition is turned on or off; true or false. event_type (string) Condition type: infra_metric The metric event; for example, system metrics, process metrics, storage metrics, or network metrics. This automatically populates for infrastructure integrations; for example, StorageSample or SystemSample. filter (string) Condition type: all If the condition was made in the UI, filter appears instead of where_clause; for example: {and: [{is: {ec2InstanceType: \"m3.medium\"}}]} Copy Recommendation: Use where_clause when creating a new condition. id (integer) Condition type: all The condition ID located in the URL. GET: This value appears in the GET response. PUT: Include this value in the DATA section. POST: Do not include this in the DATA section. DELETE: Include this value in the -X DELETE call. integration_provider (string) Condition type: infra_metric For alerts on integrations, use integration_provider instead of event_type. To see valid values: From the New Relic documentation for your cloud service, check the Find and use data section. Example: In the AWS RDS monitoring integration documentation, you can see that the DatastoreSample event type can be used with an integration_provider value of either RdsDbInstance for DB instances, or RdsDbCluster for Aurora DB clusters. name (string) Condition type: all The infrastructure alerting condition's name; for example: \"[test] process running\" Copy policy_id (integer) Condition type: all The unique ID for the alert policy's account ID associated with the condition; for example, 1234567890. This is not the policy's global ID. process_where_clause (string) Condition type: infra_process_running Any filters applied to processes, specifically in process running alert conditions. This parameter is mandatory for those types of alert conditions. For example: \"commandName = '\\''java'\\''\" Copy runbook_url (string) Condition type: all The runbook URL to display in notifications. select_value (string) Condition type: infra_metric The attribute name to identify the metric being targeted; for example, \"cpuPercent\", \"diskFreePercent\", \"memoryResidentSizeBytes\", or \"memoryFreeBytes/memoryTotalBytes*100\". This automatically populates for Infrastructure Integrations; for example, diskFreePercent. type (enum) Condition type: all The type of infrastructure alert condition: \"infra_process_running\", \"infra_metric\", or \"infra_host_not_reporting\". violation_close_timer (integer) Condition type: all The Violation time limit setting, expressed as hours. Possible values are 0, 1, 2, 4, 8,12, 24, 48, 72. This determines how much time will pass before a violation is automatically closed. Setting the time limit to 0 prevents a violation from being force-closed. For new conditions, if a value is not provided, the following default values are used: Host Not Responding (HNR) conditions: 0 (disabled) All other conditions: 24 When updating existing conditions, if a value is provided, it overrides the existing value, but does not affect already opened violations. where_clause (string) Condition type: all If applicable, this identifies any infrastructure host filters used; for example: \"(`hostname` LIKE '\\''%cassandra%'\\'')\", Copy",

      "body": "Use New Relic infrastructure's Process running alert condition to be notified when a set of processes on your filtered hosts stop running for a configurable number of minutes. This is useful, for example, when: Any of the processes on the hosts stop reporting A process you expected to start on a host (such as a new program) is not actually running This feature's flexibility allows you to easily filter what hosts and processes to monitor and when to notify selected individuals or teams. In addition, the email notification includes links to help you quickly troubleshoot the situation. Important By default, the infrastructure agent doesn't send data about the operating system's processes. To enable the sending of process data set enable_process_metrics to true. To fine-tune which processes you want to monitor, configure include_matching_metrics. Examples By applying filters to the hosts and processes that are important to your business, you can define alerting thresholds to decide when violations open and New Relic sends an email notification to you depending on the policy's incident preferences. These examples illustrate how to use infrastructure monitoring's Process running condition to monitor your processes. Ensure enough processes are running to satisfy load Problem: Some load balancers and application servers work by running many worker processes in parallel. Here, for example, you may want an alert violation when fewer than eight processes are running for a service like gunicorn. Solution: Depending on the situation, use any of these Process running thresholds options as needed: More than the defined number of processes are running Exactly the defined number of processes are running Fewer than the defined number of processes are running Ensure that critical services run constantly Problem: A service, such as a database or application server, is expected to be running constantly on certain hosts, and you need to know when it has stopped. Solution: Use the No processes are running (default) threshold. Monitor startup for critical processes that require special attention Problem: You have processes requiring special attention due to security or potential performance impact. Solution: Use the At least one process is running threshold with condition filters set to a username and specific executable so that New Relic can open a violation when the process is running. Make sure a job doesn't take too long Problem: You have a job that runs periodically, and you want to open a violation when it has been running longer than an expected number of minutes. Solution: Use the At least one process is running threshold. Validate that services started successfully Problem: When provisioning new hosts, you want to open a violation if a required service fails to successfully start up. Solution: Use the No processes are running (default) threshold. Watch for runaway processes or configuration problems Problem: Sometimes problems with processes can be solved with changes to your configuration. For example, you have more than one Chef process running, and you may need to address an issue with how that service is configured. Solution: Depending on the situation, use any of these Process running thresholds options as needed: More than the defined number of processes are running Exactly the defined number of processes are running Fewer than the defined number of processes are running Create an infrastructure process running condition To define the Process running alert criteria: Follow standard procedures to create an infrastructure alert condition. Select Process running as the Alert type. Filter what hosts and processes you want the alert condition to apply to. Define the Critical threshold for triggering the alert notification: minimum 1 minute, default 5 minutes, maximum 60 minutes. If you create the alert condition directly with infrastructure monitoring, New Relic will send an email notification when the defined threshold for the alert condition passes depending on the policy's incident preferences. Your alert policy defines which personnel or teams and which notification channels we use.",
