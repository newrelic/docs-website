To access the console, sign into the partnership owner account, and go to: https://partner-admin-console.newrelic.com/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/admin_console/ Copy You can also access the console from the New Relic UI: Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings. From the left menu bar, select Partnerships. one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Account settings > Partnerships: Partnership owners can access the Partnership Admin Console from their account settings in the New Relic UI. Console components The Partnership Admin Console has two main components: Partnership configuration settings Customer activity monitoring If multiple partnerships are associated with the New Relic parent account, the menu also includes an option to switch partnership accounts. Partnership configuration settings In developing your integration with New Relic, you must specify a number of settings. For your convenience these settings are grouped together in the partnership console, including URLs for header/footer and various redirects, SSO configuration, and keys and the ability to manipulate them. Customer activity monitoring New Relic provides you with two tools for managing your customers: State-of-the-Partnership reports and live monitoring of all deployed New Relic agents in your partnership. Both of these tools provide insight into your customers who are using New Relic. They can be used to identify up-sale opportunities or to assist your support group in proactive support. State-of-the-Partnership report The State-of-the-Partnership report provides a summary of your customers with New Relic accounts and their activities. The report is broken down by language of the agents deployed, the agent version and the language version for each account. This report is run weekly for each partner. It is available on request from your New Relic Business Development contact. This report is an excellent way to see which of your customers with New Relic accounts are in fact using the service. Partner customer monitoring The Partner customer monitoring facility provides application performance data on the New Relic enabled applications that are running on your service. This facility allows you to easily identify customers experiencing performance problems. Where the performance problems are caused by under capacity, these customers are excellent sales opportunities. Alternatively your support or services organization will find this information useful in pre-emptively identifying customer issues or as good prospects for consulting services. View an arbitrary customer To view activity of a customer that does not appear in any of the filtered views: Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Switch accounts > Other accounts. New Relic will list all of the reporting accounts in the partnership. You can filter or search the list. Viewing detailed customer data Under normal circumstances a partner will be able to see only the summary level data in a customer's New Relic account. Through the Partnership Admin Console, partners will be permitted to drill down to the more detailed presentation. If you want to drill down from the Partnership Admin Console, add your user (typically support@partner.com or something similar) to the account. Typically this will be done at account creation. Avoid provisioning this user as the account Owner.",

Co-branding example This example is from Heroku's New Relic integration. In this case Heroku has chosen to use a header only. New Relic partner co-branding example: Here is an example of co-branding with New Relic by using a header. Headers and footers To implement headers and footers: Create a header and/or footer page, consisting of content enclosed in < div> tags. Make sure the pages do not import any CSS or contain any inline CSS. Take any CSS needed for the header and footer, and make it available in a separate CSS file. For example, prepend a custom string such as yourcompany_ to the various style names, to avoid overriding New Relic's standard style definitions. Post the three files to publicly accessible locations hosted by the partner. Use https so your customers do not see any mixed content warnings. For example: https://yourcompany.com/newrelic_header.htm https://yourcompany.com/newrelic_footer.htm https://yourcompany.com/newrelic_styles.css Copy Enter the URLs for the header, footer, and CSS page locations into the appropriate fields in the New Relic Partnership console. Tip To view the headers, log in to one of the accounts in the partnership. Layouts and styles Header and footer layouts and styles are loaded and cached on New Relic's collector servers for insertion into each page output. Updates made to the layout on the partner's site are automatically refreshed hourly. Customized links to the partner's website may be added to the layout. If single sign-on is enabled, the partner may inject customer-specific information into the New Relic user session for use by the layout. For more information, see Single sign on and access control. Sub-domains Partners can optionally display a custom subdomain; for example, yourcompany.newrelic.com, to customers accessing New Relic accounts. To arrange this, contact New Relic's Business Enablement team.",

      "body": "Thank you for your interest in partnering with New Relic. We look forward to providing your customers with powerful, easy-to-use application performance monitoring. This guide explains how to bundle New Relic services with yours. An effective bundling includes technical tasks (such as agent provisioning and console integration) as well as marketing and promotional activities (such as branding and awareness generation). Process To achieve a full and productive integration with New Relic you will need to: What How Integrate your user console with New Relic. Update your user portal to automatically create New Relic accounts and make them available to your customers in a convenient, compelling, co-branded way. Provision the New Relic agent. For your customers to benefit from New Relic, they will need our monitoring agent installed into their apps. Update your provisioning systems to install New Relic automatically. Generate awareness. Integrate and deploy New Relic facilities for displaying sample application reporting data to customers. Establish support and sustaining engineering processes. Agree on a process for support coordination and refresh of New Relic software. Set up communication. Tip: We've found that partners typically complete integration with one to two developer weeks of effort. For more information, see Typical component tasks. Accelerated process Where circumstances and/or proximity permit, we have found that bringing your developers on site to New Relic's San Francisco offices can dramatically accelerate development of your integration. At New Relic's offices your developers will work in close proximity to the engineering team that is responsible for the development and maintenance of New Relic's APIs. Development issues that would under other circumstances require hours or days to resolve can be addressed in minutes. Typically development time for an integration can be cut in half. Should you elect to pursue this option, please talk to your New Relic technical contact. Typical component tasks The checklist for creating a successful integration will vary with each partner and specific circumstances. As a general guide, here's a typical outline of the components and rough sequencing of tasks involved in creating an integration with New Relic. Done Component tasks of a typical partner integration Finalize business relationship. Have introductory conference call or meeting for technical team. Review partner integration documentation and other integration materials. Review roles and responsibilities. Develop integration plan with timeline. Plan account and agent provisioning. Create and deploy account provisioning system. Determine which agents and how to provision. Create and deploy webpages to support provisioning and deployment. Set up test partnership and accounts on New Relic's staging server. Plan for co-branding. Create and deploy CSS. Create and deploy header and footer. Create branded URL (cname). Drive adoption through creating awareness. Add the New Relic widget to the user console. Use data API integration. Test integration on staging. Set up partnership on New Relic's production server. Modify integration to point to production server. Test integration on production. Establish a support plan. Designate support contacts. Introduce New Relic Support to your technical support team. Create sustaining engineering plans. Get test account. Prepare for launch. Walk through integration review and signoff (conference call). Document final signup flow. Coordinate on launch co-marketing and PR. Go live!",

Console components The Partnership Admin Console has two main components: Partnership configuration settings Customer activity monitoring If multiple partnerships are associated with the New Relic parent account, the menu also includes an option to switch partnership accounts. Partnership configuration settings In developing your integration with New Relic, you must specify a number of settings. For your convenience these settings are grouped together in the partnership console, including URLs for header/footer and various redirects, SSO configuration, and keys and the ability to manipulate them. Customer activity monitoring New Relic provides you with two tools for managing your customers: State-of-the-Partnership reports and live monitoring of all deployed New Relic agents in your partnership. Both of these tools provide insight into your customers who are using New Relic. They can be used to identify up-sale opportunities or to assist your support group in proactive support. State-of-the-Partnership report The State-of-the-Partnership report provides a summary of your customers with New Relic accounts and their activities. The report is broken down by language of the agents deployed, the agent version and the language version for each account. This report is run weekly for each partner. It is available on request from your New Relic Business Development contact. This report is an excellent way to see which of your customers with New Relic accounts are in fact using the service. Partner customer monitoring The Partner customer monitoring facility provides application performance data on the New Relic enabled applications that are running on your service. This facility allows you to easily identify customers experiencing performance problems. Where the performance problems are caused by under capacity, these customers are excellent sales opportunities. Alternatively your support or services organization will find this information useful in pre-emptively identifying customer issues or as good prospects for consulting services. View an arbitrary customer To view activity of a customer that does not appear in any of the filtered views: Go to one.newrelic.com > (account dropdown) > Switch accounts > Other accounts. New Relic will list all of the reporting accounts in the partnership. You can filter or search the list. Viewing detailed customer data Under normal circumstances a partner will be able to see only the summary level data in a customer's New Relic account. Through the Partnership Admin Console, partners will be permitted to drill down to the more detailed presentation. If you want to drill down from the Partnership Admin Console, add your user (typically support@partner.com or something similar) to the account. Typically this will be done at account creation. Avoid provisioning this user as the account Owner.",

      "body": "Thank you for your interest in partnering with New Relic. We look forward to providing your customers with powerful, easy-to-use application performance monitoring. This guide explains how to bundle New Relic services with yours. An effective bundling includes technical tasks (such as agent provisioning and console integration) as well as marketing and promotional activities (such as branding and awareness generation). Process To achieve a full and productive integration with New Relic you will need to: What How Integrate your user console with New Relic. Update your user portal to automatically create New Relic accounts and make them available to your customers in a convenient, compelling, co-branded way. Provision the New Relic agent. For your customers to benefit from New Relic, they will need our monitoring agent installed into their apps. Update your provisioning systems to install New Relic automatically. Generate awareness. Integrate and deploy New Relic facilities for displaying sample application reporting data to customers. Establish support and sustaining engineering processes. Agree on a process for support coordination and refresh of New Relic software. Set up communication. Tip: We've found that partners typically complete integration with one to two developer weeks of effort. For more information, see Typical component tasks. Accelerated process Where circumstances and/or proximity permit, we have found that bringing your developers on site to New Relic's San Francisco offices can dramatically accelerate development of your integration. At New Relic's offices your developers will work in close proximity to the engineering team that is responsible for the development and maintenance of New Relic's APIs. Development issues that would under other circumstances require hours or days to resolve can be addressed in minutes. Typically development time for an integration can be cut in half. Should you elect to pursue this option, please talk to your New Relic technical contact. Typical component tasks The checklist for creating a successful integration will vary with each partner and specific circumstances. As a general guide, here's a typical outline of the components and rough sequencing of tasks involved in creating an integration with New Relic. Done Component tasks of a typical partner integration Finalize business relationship. Have introductory conference call or meeting for technical team. Review partner integration documentation and other integration materials. Review roles and responsibilities. Develop integration plan with timeline. Plan account and agent provisioning. Create and deploy account provisioning system. Determine which agents and how to provision. Create and deploy webpages to support provisioning and deployment. Set up test partnership and accounts on New Relic's staging server. Plan for co-branding. Create and deploy CSS. Create and deploy header and footer. Create branded URL (cname). Drive adoption through creating awareness. Add the New Relic widget to the user console. Use data API integration. Test integration on staging. Set up partnership on New Relic's production server. Modify integration to point to production server. Test integration on production. Establish a support plan. Designate support contacts. Introduce New Relic Support to your technical support team. Create sustaining engineering plans. Get test account. Prepare for launch. Walk through integration review and signoff (conference call). Document final signup flow. Coordinate on launch co-marketing and PR. Go live!",

      "body": "Important This information is for New Relic partners. If you are not a New Relic partner, refer to the information about pricing and billing for New Relic accounts. Partners: For account setup procedures, see New Relic's Partner API documentation. For specific product pricing details (such as New Relic APM), visit New Relic's website, or contact your Alliance & Channels representative at New Relic. Commitment levels When customers choose a product, they also choose a monthly or annual commitment level. Existing partnerships have the option of limiting available product offerings for their customers. Reseller partners may be able to modify these subscription terms based on the contractual terms in the partner agreement with New Relic. Customized partnership pricing Partnership accounts may offer customized pricing. Customized pricing models, rates, minimums, discounts, and options vary by partnership--the actual pricing model used is subject to the contractual terms of the partner's agreement with New Relic. Contact your Alliance & Channels representative at New Relic to learn more. Partnership billing options New Relic supports the following billing options for partnerships. All subscriptions commence and expire at midnight GMT. For host-based subscriptions, fees are charged in advance for the month. Upgrade requests are honored immediately without any billing for partial use during the month. Downgrades take effect at the next payment date. To view New Relic account billing details and history from the user interface: From one.newrelic.com, select (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Billing. Billing option Description Credit card When partners choose credit card billing, your customers are directly charged using the credit card information provided during their New Relic subscription signup. This does not include any license fees paid directly by the partner for their customers' accounts. Invoice When partners choose invoice billing, your customers are billed directly by New Relic via invoice for their subscriptions. This option is normally provided on special request to customers with large monthly costs for which credit card billing would be impractical. Reseller For resellers, partners are billed directly for all customer accounts based on the calendar month. Partners may be responsible for accounting for customer usage, pricing, and subscriptions. Resellers have the option to implement an integration between our respective accounting systems. New Relic will invoice the partner monthly, using the Billing integration API for each of the paying accounts under the partnership. Cancellations Once a New Relic account cancellation takes effect, you must uninstall and/or delete all agents or other data-reporting integrations. For uninstallation details, see the documentation for the relevant agents and integrations. Customers may continue to access their data on New Relic until it is purged in accordance with the data retention policy corresponding to the product level. For existing accounts with paid, fixed host subscriptions, cancellations take effect at the next payment date. New Relic will continue to accept data for cancelled accounts until this date. Cancellations for accounts with free or paid based subscriptions take effect immediately. Promotions New Relic allows promotions for accounts offered through partnerships. Promotions associated with a specific partnership may only be redeemed on accounts associated with the partnership. Each promotion has a unique code. This promotion code may be applied only once per account. New Relic may impose further limits on the number of promotions that a customer may apply to an account. Promotion Description Free trials New Relic may include a free trial period for features normally available only through a paid subscription level. This option is provided for a specified number of days. The customer's subscription automatically reverts to its prior level at the conclusion of the trial. Payments for paid subscriptions are not interrupted by the redemption of a free trial promotion on the account. Single use Single use trials expire after they are used once. Discount (deprecated) A one-time percentage discount is applied to a paid subscription. This discount is applied in addition to any volume discounts and customized partner prices. The discount remains in effect until the subscription is modified or cancelled. Legacy products and commitment levels If you have questions about older New Relic products that have been converted to new pricing models, contact your Alliance & Channels representative at New Relic.

      "body": "New Relic supports Single Sign On (SSO) as a convenience for partner customers. Partners implementing SSO also have the option to restrict access by requiring customers to access New Relic via the partner's management site or product login. Single Sign On is a convenience for your customers, eliminating the requirement of entering sign on credentials multiple times, and it creates a more unified experience for the user. In situations where this distinction is desired, SSO is recommended. Where it is desirable to maintain a distinction between the services or where technical considerations preclude implementing SSO, a fully functioning integration is still achievable. Implement Single Sign On Two methods for SSO are supported by New Relic. New Relic upgraded its single sign on system during 2011. If you implemented single sign on with New Relic prior to September 2011, you will have used the old system. That method of implementing SSO has been deprecated. All new integrations must use the new system. Existing implementations using the old system will continue to work indefinitely. However, we encourage all partners using the old system to upgrade to the new model. Use shared secret method The upgraded shared secret version of New Relic's SSO implementation offers several improvements over the old handshake version. Most important, the system is more secure. Security is enhanced by the use of passing a SHA1 digest of a shared secret, a timestamp, and request specific data in the authentication SSO request. The shared secret can be any string. Whatever shared secret is chosen, enter it in the appropriate field in the New Relic Partner console. To edit the SSO settings: Log in to the partnership owner account. From the account dropdown in the New Relic UI, select Account settings > Partnerships > Edit settings. For SSO type, select signature. For SSO data, type the shared secret. Select Save. In addition to enhanced security, the new SSO method supports a session cookie. Nav data may be stored in the session cookie to support enhanced functionality of headers and footers. The name of the cookie is specified through the Partner console. If unspecified the cookie name defaults to nav_data. To successfully use this SSO method, the SSO URI must be invoked from the user's browser. On success the browser will be automatically logged into New Relic and the redirect URL to that account returned. The SSO URI however should not be generated on the browser, as this would expose the shared secret and allow the login to be spoofed. The URI should be generated on a host and passed to the user's browser. SSO API Description SSO authentication request Method POST or GET URI https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/sso_access Copy Parameters Name Required Description id Yes ID of the New Relic account. email No Email address of user logging in (optional). If given, the user must already have been added to the account. By default, the account Owner role is used. Account Owners have full privileges on accounts.

      "body": "Important This information is for New Relic partners. If you are not a New Relic partner, refer to the information about pricing and billing for New Relic accounts. Partners: For account setup procedures, see New Relic's Partner API documentation. For specific product pricing details (such as New Relic APM), visit New Relic's website, or contact your Alliance & Channels representative at New Relic. Commitment levels When customers choose a product, they also choose a monthly or annual commitment level. Existing partnerships have the option of limiting available product offerings for their customers. Reseller partners may be able to modify these subscription terms based on the contractual terms in the partner agreement with New Relic. Customized partnership pricing Partnership accounts may offer customized pricing. Customized pricing models, rates, minimums, discounts, and options vary by partnership--the actual pricing model used is subject to the contractual terms of the partner's agreement with New Relic. Contact your Alliance & Channels representative at New Relic to learn more. Partnership billing options New Relic supports the following billing options for partnerships. All subscriptions commence and expire at midnight GMT. For host-based subscriptions, fees are charged in advance for the month. Upgrade requests are honored immediately without any billing for partial use during the month. Downgrades take effect at the next payment date. To view New Relic account billing details and history from the user interface: From one.newrelic.com, select (account dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Billing. Billing option Description Credit card When partners choose credit card billing, your customers are directly charged using the credit card information provided during their New Relic subscription signup. This does not include any license fees paid directly by the partner for their customers' accounts. Invoice When partners choose invoice billing, your customers are billed directly by New Relic via invoice for their subscriptions. This option is normally provided on special request to customers with large monthly costs for which credit card billing would be impractical. Reseller For resellers, partners are billed directly for all customer accounts based on the calendar month. Partners may be responsible for accounting for customer usage, pricing, and subscriptions. Resellers have the option to implement an integration between our respective accounting systems. New Relic will invoice the partner monthly, using the Billing integration API for each of the paying accounts under the partnership. Cancellations Once a New Relic account cancellation takes effect, you must uninstall and/or delete all agents or other data-reporting integrations. For uninstallation details, see the documentation for the relevant agents and integrations. Customers may continue to access their data on New Relic until it is purged in accordance with the data retention policy corresponding to the product level. For existing accounts with paid, fixed host subscriptions, cancellations take effect at the next payment date. New Relic will continue to accept data for cancelled accounts until this date. Cancellations for accounts with free or paid based subscriptions take effect immediately. Promotions New Relic allows promotions for accounts offered through partnerships. Promotions associated with a specific partnership may only be redeemed on accounts associated with the partnership. Each promotion has a unique code. This promotion code may be applied only once per account. New Relic may impose further limits on the number of promotions that a customer may apply to an account. Promotion Description Free trials New Relic may include a free trial period for features normally available only through a paid subscription level. This option is provided for a specified number of days. The customer's subscription automatically reverts to its prior level at the conclusion of the trial. Payments for paid subscriptions are not interrupted by the redemption of a free trial promotion on the account. Single use Single use trials expire after they are used once. Discount (deprecated) A one-time percentage discount is applied to a paid subscription. This discount is applied in addition to any volume discounts and customized partner prices. The discount remains in effect until the subscription is modified or cancelled. Legacy products and commitment levels If you have questions about older New Relic products that have been converted to new pricing models, contact your Alliance & Channels representative at New Relic.

      "body": "Our Partnership API allows New Relic partners, and New Relic accounts set up as customer partnerships, to manage accounts, users, and subscription-related settings. Requirements The Partnership API can be used by two types of New Relic accounts: partners (managed service providers, resellers) and customer partnerships (larger customers who have been given access to our partnership account structure). These docs are for version 2 of the Partner API. Earlier versions have been deprecated. If you have problems with an older integration, upgrade to version 2. Access to the partnership account structure and the Partnership API requires prior setup and approval by New Relic. Partnership API calls require authentication with both your partnership owner account's REST API key and your Partner ID. Accounts that are genuine New Relic partners (managed service providers, resellers) have no restrictions on using the API. Accounts set up as customer partnerships have restrictions that follow. Customer partnership restrictions If your New Relic organization is set up as a customer partnership, there are some restrictions in place if your organization is on our newer pricing plan or our newer user model. Details: Pricing plan. If you’re on New Relic One pricing, you can't use API calls that govern our original pricing plan. The API impacts are: You can't use the subscription object You can't use the NerdGraph Provisioning API. User model. If your New Relic account has been converted to be entirely on the New Relic One user model, you can no longer use API calls that create or govern users on our original user model. The API impacts are: You can't use the user object. Instead, you'd manage users with these user management docs. For the account object: you can't add users via the users field. Instead, you'd manage users with these user management docs. To determine your pricing plan or user model, see Overview of pricing and user model changes. Password requirements Passwords passed for account creation have these requirements: 8 to 50 characters in length Only contain letters, numbers, or special characters Cannot contain spaces Must contain at least 1 letter Must contain at least 1 number or special character Things you can do Here is an overview of the API's functionality. Account: The account object is what you use to create and update accounts. You can do the following with it: Create new Show Update Cancel Show usage Set primary admin (some accounts) Set subscription (some accounts) There is also a child account object for creating child accounts. Users: Some organizations that meet the requirements can use the user object to: Add user access to account Remove user access from account Subscription: Organizations that meet the requirements and are on our original product pricing plan can use the subscription object to configure various subscription-related traits.

      "body": "New Relic organizations set up as partnership accounts have access to an enhanced hierarchical way of organizing their account structure. Partnerships with New Relic There are two types of New Relic organizations that are able to use our partnership account structure and the Partnership API: An actual partnership: A partnership refers to managed service providers or resellers, who offer New Relic products to their customers. Heroku is one example of such a New Relic partner. A customer partnership: some of our larger organizations also make use of our partnership account structure. We call these customers \"customer partnerships.\" Use of our partnership account structure requires prior approval and set up by New Relic representatives. For customer partnerships, New Relic contacts organizations that would benefit from such a structure. Partnerships are identified by a numeric PARTNER_ID. In some cases, a New Relic customer may have more than one partnership; for example, when one section of New Relic users must be managed differently from another. Partnerships are administered by a partnership owner account. The account that owns a partnership functions differently from a regular account. If multiple partnerships have been set up, each has a unique PARTNER_ID. Account hierarchy New Relic partnership organizations consist of the partnership owning account, partnerships, parent accounts, and child accounts. A partnership can have multiple parent and child accounts. To understand how child accounts and parent accounts scale with EU region accounts, see EU region account hierarchy. Tip If you don't have a partnership organization, you can only have one parent account. For more information, see Manage apps or users with child accounts. All parent and child accounts roll up to your partnership account. Partnership owner accounts (POA) The partnership owner account (POA) is the entity that is used to administer a partnership. It controls which users manage accounts under partnerships, have access to the partner API, and manage other aspects of the partnership. Do not monitor your own applications from the partnership owner account. Instead, create an account within the partnership and monitor apps from that account. Users on the partnership owner account can access accounts under their partnerships and enjoy User level privileges. Admins on the POA can access accounts under their partnerships and enjoy Admin level privileges, including permission to manage users. The Owner of the partnership owner account will still only have Admin level access on accounts under the partnership. That means that the owner cannot enable SAML SSO, change the account owner, cancel the account via the UI, etc. The partnership owner account enjoys special privileges, and it lets you exercise the capabilities defined in your partnership agreement with New Relic. For example, you may use your partnership owner account with the New Relic Partnership API to set up and manage users on your accounts or to view your customers' performance data in the New Relic UI. Tip Many of the Partnership API calls return an account status as part of the XML. Child accounts with partnerships Child accounts behave differently than other New Relic accounts provisioned through your partnership: Child accounts Comments Account creation Child accounts can be created through the Partnership API or New Relic user interface. In order to group accounts through the New Relic user interface, your partnership must have Admin privileges, and the account must have the appropriate subscription level. If you have any questions about partnership privileges or subscription levels, contact your New Relic account representative. Child accounts do not have a New Relic subscription of their own. They inherit the parent account's subscription. Billing Billing is applied at the parent account level. Exception: Reseller partnerships receive consolidated billing for all accounts under the partnership. Permissions Admin-level users on a parent account have the ability to create, modify, and delete children accounts for the parent account. Users that have been granted access permissions on a parent account automatically inherit the same level of access for all children accounts. This is also true for add-on roles. Exception: Child account users won't receive alert emails or weekly report emails unless they are explicitly granted permission on these child accounts. Account users You can use the Partnership user API to add and maintain your customer users. An account must always have at least one person (the Owner) associated with it. For security purposes, you cannot change an account Owner with the Partnership user API. Instead, you must change the account Owner from the Users page in the New Relic UI. In addition, a specific user may be associated with multiple accounts. For example, many New Relic users have accounts through a partnership, and they also have accounts they created directly with New Relic. Partnership pricing Accounts within a partnership organization may have different levels of access to New Relic products. Tip Many of the Partnership API calls return a subscription status as part of the XML. For accounts set up through a partnership: An account can have multiple New Relic products associated with it. However, only one subscription per product may be active at any time. For example, a user may have both an Essentials subscription and a higher service level Pro Trial subscription. When the Pro Trial subscription expires, the service level returns to the Essentials subscription. Promotions may appear as a subscription change. Several factors affect starting and stopping subscriptions, including how New Relic handles pricing and billing.",

      "body": "New Relic organizations set up as partnership accounts have access to an enhanced hierarchical way of organizing their account structure. Partnerships with New Relic There are two types of New Relic organizations that are able to use our partnership account structure and the Partnership API: An actual partnership: A partnership refers to managed service providers or resellers, who offer New Relic products to their customers. Heroku is one example of such a New Relic partner. A customer partnership: some of our larger organizations also make use of our partnership account structure. We call these customers \"customer partnerships.\" Use of our partnership account structure requires prior approval and set up by New Relic representatives. For customer partnerships, New Relic contacts organizations that would benefit from such a structure. Partnerships are identified by a numeric PARTNER_ID. In some cases, a New Relic customer may have more than one partnership; for example, when one section of New Relic users must be managed differently from another. Partnerships are administered by a partnership owner account. The account that owns a partnership functions differently from a regular account. If multiple partnerships have been set up, each has a unique PARTNER_ID. Account hierarchy New Relic partnership organizations consist of the partnership owning account, partnerships, parent accounts, and child accounts. A partnership can have multiple parent and child accounts. To understand how child accounts and parent accounts scale with EU region accounts, see EU region account hierarchy. Tip If you don't have a partnership organization, you can only have one parent account. For more information, see Manage apps or users with child accounts. All parent and child accounts roll up to your partnership account. Partnership owner accounts (POA) The partnership owner account (POA) is the entity that is used to administer a partnership. It controls which users manage accounts under partnerships, have access to the partner API, and manage other aspects of the partnership. Do not monitor your own applications from the partnership owner account. Instead, create an account within the partnership and monitor apps from that account. Users on the partnership owner account can access accounts under their partnerships and enjoy User level privileges. Admins on the POA can access accounts under their partnerships and enjoy Admin level privileges, including permission to manage users. The Owner of the partnership owner account will still only have Admin level access on accounts under the partnership. That means that the owner cannot enable SAML SSO, change the account owner, cancel the account via the UI, etc. The partnership owner account enjoys special privileges, and it lets you exercise the capabilities defined in your partnership agreement with New Relic. For example, you may use your partnership owner account with the New Relic Partnership API to set up and manage users on your accounts or to view your customers' performance data in the New Relic UI. Tip Many of the Partnership API calls return an account status as part of the XML. Child accounts with partnerships Child accounts behave differently than other New Relic accounts provisioned through your partnership: Child accounts Comments Account creation Child accounts can be created through the Partnership API or New Relic user interface. In order to group accounts through the New Relic user interface, your partnership must have Admin privileges, and the account must have the appropriate subscription level. If you have any questions about partnership privileges or subscription levels, contact your New Relic account representative. Child accounts do not have a New Relic subscription of their own. They inherit the parent account's subscription. Billing Billing is applied at the parent account level. Exception: Reseller partnerships receive consolidated billing for all accounts under the partnership. Permissions Admin-level users on a parent account have the ability to create, modify, and delete children accounts for the parent account. Users that have been granted access permissions on a parent account automatically inherit the same level of access for all children accounts. This is also true for add-on roles. Exception: Child account users won't receive alert emails or weekly report emails unless they are explicitly granted permission on these child accounts. Account users You can use the Partnership user API to add and maintain your customer users. An account must always have at least one person (the Owner) associated with it. For security purposes, you cannot change an account Owner with the Partnership user API. Instead, you must change the account Owner from the Users page in the New Relic UI. In addition, a specific user may be associated with multiple accounts. For example, many New Relic users have accounts through a partnership, and they also have accounts they created directly with New Relic. Partnership pricing Accounts within a partnership organization may have different levels of access to New Relic products. Tip Many of the Partnership API calls return a subscription status as part of the XML. For accounts set up through a partnership: An account can have multiple New Relic products associated with it. However, only one subscription per product may be active at any time. For example, a user may have both an Essentials subscription and a higher service level Pro Trial subscription. When the Pro Trial subscription expires, the service level returns to the Essentials subscription. Promotions may appear as a subscription change. Several factors affect starting and stopping subscriptions, including how New Relic handles pricing and billing.",

Requirements The Partnership API can be used by two types of New Relic accounts: partners (managed service providers, resellers) and customer partnerships (larger customers who have been given access to our partnership account structure). These docs are for version 2 of the Partner API. Earlier versions have been deprecated. If you have problems with an older integration, upgrade to version 2. Access to the partnership account structure and the Partnership API requires prior setup and approval by New Relic. Partnership API calls require authentication with both your partnership owner account's REST API key and your Partner ID. Accounts that are genuine New Relic partners (managed service providers, resellers) have no restrictions on using the API. Accounts set up as customer partnerships have restrictions that follow. Customer partnership restrictions If your New Relic organization is set up as a customer partnership, there are some restrictions in place if your organization is on our newer pricing plan or our newer user model. Details: Pricing plan. If you’re on New Relic One pricing, you can't use API calls that govern our original pricing plan. The API impacts are: You can't use the subscription object You can't use the NerdGraph Provisioning API. User model. If your New Relic account has been converted to be entirely on the New Relic One user model, you can no longer use API calls that create or govern users on our original user model. The API impacts are: You can't use the user object. Instead, you'd manage users with these user management docs. For the account object: you can't add users via the users field. Instead, you'd manage users with these user management docs. To determine your pricing plan or user model, see Overview of pricing and user model changes. Password requirements Passwords passed for account creation have these requirements: 8 to 50 characters in length Only contain letters, numbers, or special characters Cannot contain spaces Must contain at least 1 letter Must contain at least 1 number or special character Things you can do Here is an overview of the API's functionality. Account: The account object is what you use to create and update accounts. You can do the following with it: Create new Show Update Cancel Show usage Set primary admin (some accounts) Set subscription (some accounts) There is also a child account object for creating child accounts. Users: Some organizations that meet the requirements can use the user object to: Add user access to account Remove user access from account Subscription: Organizations that meet the requirements and are on our original product pricing plan can use the subscription object to configure various subscription-related traits.

Adding an active subscription to the account will re-activate the account. Partnership owner account The Partnership Owner Account is not part of the partnership. It owns the partnership. Attempts to treat it as if it were in the partnership will fail. This includes but is not limited to: Attempting to SSO into the partnership owner account using the partnership shared secret Expecting the partnership pricing to apply to the partnership owner account",

      "body": "New Relic organizations set up as partnership accounts have access to an enhanced hierarchical way of organizing their account structure. Partnerships with New Relic There are two types of New Relic organizations that are able to use our partnership account structure and the Partnership API: An actual partnership: A partnership refers to managed service providers or resellers, who offer New Relic products to their customers. Heroku is one example of such a New Relic partner. A customer partnership: some of our larger organizations also make use of our partnership account structure. We call these customers \"customer partnerships.\" Use of our partnership account structure requires prior approval and set up by New Relic representatives. For customer partnerships, New Relic contacts organizations that would benefit from such a structure. Partnerships are identified by a numeric PARTNER_ID. In some cases, a New Relic customer may have more than one partnership; for example, when one section of New Relic users must be managed differently from another. Partnerships are administered by a partnership owner account. The account that owns a partnership functions differently from a regular account. If multiple partnerships have been set up, each has a unique PARTNER_ID. Account hierarchy New Relic partnership organizations consist of the partnership owning account, partnerships, parent accounts, and child accounts. A partnership can have multiple parent and child accounts. To understand how child accounts and parent accounts scale with EU region accounts, see EU region account hierarchy. Tip If you don't have a partnership organization, you can only have one parent account. For more information, see Manage apps or users with child accounts. All parent and child accounts roll up to your partnership account. Partnership owner accounts (POA) The partnership owner account (POA) is the entity that is used to administer a partnership. It controls which users manage accounts under partnerships, have access to the partner API, and manage other aspects of the partnership. Do not monitor your own applications from the partnership owner account. Instead, create an account within the partnership and monitor apps from that account. Users on the partnership owner account can access accounts under their partnerships and enjoy User level privileges. Admins on the POA can access accounts under their partnerships and enjoy Admin level privileges, including permission to manage users. The Owner of the partnership owner account will still only have Admin level access on accounts under the partnership. That means that the owner cannot enable SAML SSO, change the account owner, cancel the account via the UI, etc. The partnership owner account enjoys special privileges, and it lets you exercise the capabilities defined in your partnership agreement with New Relic. For example, you may use your partnership owner account with the New Relic Partnership API to set up and manage users on your accounts or to view your customers' performance data in the New Relic UI. Tip Many of the Partnership API calls return an account status as part of the XML. Child accounts with partnerships Child accounts behave differently than other New Relic accounts provisioned through your partnership: Child accounts Comments Account creation Child accounts can be created through the Partnership API or New Relic user interface. In order to group accounts through the New Relic user interface, your partnership must have Admin privileges, and the account must have the appropriate subscription level. If you have any questions about partnership privileges or subscription levels, contact your New Relic account representative. Child accounts do not have a New Relic subscription of their own. They inherit the parent account's subscription. Billing Billing is applied at the parent account level. Exception: Reseller partnerships receive consolidated billing for all accounts under the partnership. Permissions Admin-level users on a parent account have the ability to create, modify, and delete children accounts for the parent account. Users that have been granted access permissions on a parent account automatically inherit the same level of access for all children accounts. This is also true for add-on roles. Exception: Child account users won't receive alert emails or weekly report emails unless they are explicitly granted permission on these child accounts. Account users You can use the Partnership user API to add and maintain your customer users. An account must always have at least one person (the Owner) associated with it. For security purposes, you cannot change an account Owner with the Partnership user API. Instead, you must change the account Owner from the Users page in the New Relic UI. In addition, a specific user may be associated with multiple accounts. For example, many New Relic users have accounts through a partnership, and they also have accounts they created directly with New Relic. Partnership pricing Accounts within a partnership organization may have different levels of access to New Relic products. Tip Many of the Partnership API calls return a subscription status as part of the XML. For accounts set up through a partnership: An account can have multiple New Relic products associated with it. However, only one subscription per product may be active at any time. For example, a user may have both an Essentials subscription and a higher service level Pro Trial subscription. When the Pro Trial subscription expires, the service level returns to the Essentials subscription. Promotions may appear as a subscription change. Several factors affect starting and stopping subscriptions, including how New Relic handles pricing and billing.",

      "body": "New Relic organizations set up as partnership accounts have access to an enhanced hierarchical way of organizing their account structure. Partnerships with New Relic There are two types of New Relic organizations that are able to use our partnership account structure and the Partnership API: An actual partnership: A partnership refers to managed service providers or resellers, who offer New Relic products to their customers. Heroku is one example of such a New Relic partner. A customer partnership: some of our larger organizations also make use of our partnership account structure. We call these customers \"customer partnerships.\" Use of our partnership account structure requires prior approval and set up by New Relic representatives. For customer partnerships, New Relic contacts organizations that would benefit from such a structure. Partnerships are identified by a numeric PARTNER_ID. In some cases, a New Relic customer may have more than one partnership; for example, when one section of New Relic users must be managed differently from another. Partnerships are administered by a partnership owner account. The account that owns a partnership functions differently from a regular account. If multiple partnerships have been set up, each has a unique PARTNER_ID. Account hierarchy New Relic partnership organizations consist of the partnership owning account, partnerships, parent accounts, and child accounts. A partnership can have multiple parent and child accounts. To understand how child accounts and parent accounts scale with EU region accounts, see EU region account hierarchy. Tip If you don't have a partnership organization, you can only have one parent account. For more information, see Manage apps or users with child accounts. All parent and child accounts roll up to your partnership account. Partnership owner accounts (POA) The partnership owner account (POA) is the entity that is used to administer a partnership. It controls which users manage accounts under partnerships, have access to the partner API, and manage other aspects of the partnership. Do not monitor your own applications from the partnership owner account. Instead, create an account within the partnership and monitor apps from that account. Users on the partnership owner account can access accounts under their partnerships and enjoy User level privileges. Admins on the POA can access accounts under their partnerships and enjoy Admin level privileges, including permission to manage users. The Owner of the partnership owner account will still only have Admin level access on accounts under the partnership. That means that the owner cannot enable SAML SSO, change the account owner, cancel the account via the UI, etc. The partnership owner account enjoys special privileges, and it lets you exercise the capabilities defined in your partnership agreement with New Relic. For example, you may use your partnership owner account with the New Relic Partnership API to set up and manage users on your accounts or to view your customers' performance data in the New Relic UI. Tip Many of the Partnership API calls return an account status as part of the XML. Child accounts with partnerships Child accounts behave differently than other New Relic accounts provisioned through your partnership: Child accounts Comments Account creation Child accounts can be created through the Partnership API or New Relic user interface. In order to group accounts through the New Relic user interface, your partnership must have Admin privileges, and the account must have the appropriate subscription level. If you have any questions about partnership privileges or subscription levels, contact your New Relic account representative. Child accounts do not have a New Relic subscription of their own. They inherit the parent account's subscription. Billing Billing is applied at the parent account level. Exception: Reseller partnerships receive consolidated billing for all accounts under the partnership. Permissions Admin-level users on a parent account have the ability to create, modify, and delete children accounts for the parent account. Users that have been granted access permissions on a parent account automatically inherit the same level of access for all children accounts. This is also true for add-on roles. Exception: Child account users won't receive alert emails or weekly report emails unless they are explicitly granted permission on these child accounts. Account users You can use the Partnership user API to add and maintain your customer users. An account must always have at least one person (the Owner) associated with it. For security purposes, you cannot change an account Owner with the Partnership user API. Instead, you must change the account Owner from the Users page in the New Relic UI. In addition, a specific user may be associated with multiple accounts. For example, many New Relic users have accounts through a partnership, and they also have accounts they created directly with New Relic. Partnership pricing Accounts within a partnership organization may have different levels of access to New Relic products. Tip Many of the Partnership API calls return a subscription status as part of the XML. For accounts set up through a partnership: An account can have multiple New Relic products associated with it. However, only one subscription per product may be active at any time. For example, a user may have both an Essentials subscription and a higher service level Pro Trial subscription. When the Pro Trial subscription expires, the service level returns to the Essentials subscription. Promotions may appear as a subscription change. Several factors affect starting and stopping subscriptions, including how New Relic handles pricing and billing.",

Marketing activity Description Social media support Let New Relic help amplify your social media through tweets, retweets, Facebook likes, shares, etc. Event opportunities Participate in local meetups or find out about other events or co-sponsorship opportunities. Webinar Co-host a webinar; for example, see: Three Powerful Tools for Improving the Performance of Your Drupal Site Guest blog posts New Relic loves great blog content, and partners are often an essential source. You're encouraged to write a guest blog post for http://blog.newrelic.com. What's in it for you? It's a great opportunity for you to promote your company and the integration you've built. Our blog is popular reading for the New Relic community, and our customers are frequently among the fastest growing innovators. How does it work? You draft the post and supply screenshots and/or video as applicable. New Relic will edit, format, publish, and promote the post. You'll get credit as the author, and you can include a paragraph at the end mentioning your product. How do you create a great blog post? The goal is to be insightful, useful, thought provoking, smart, surprising, and entertaining—or at least some combination of those elements. Blog post guidelines Comments Writing style Recommendation: Write your blog post in the first person. New Relic's target audience includes developers, DevOps, IT ops, execs, marketers, and data scientists working with big data, but we have no problem attracting a wider readership than that. We want to intrigue them and help them do their jobs better and more passionately. Passion and connection are essential. If you do not care about the topic you are blogging about or, more importantly, you do not appear to care about it, neither will the reader. Length A typical blog post runs approximately 500 words, but it may be longer or shorter if there is a good reason. Technical blog posts may run much longer, while posts with video may not need much text at all. Content Each post should focus on a single main idea. If you have a mashup of multiple ideas, consider breaking them up into a series of multiple, related posts. Posts do not have to be based on the latest news, but they shouldn't pretend that old news is new. If you're writing about something that's not brand new, you need to acknowledge that and come up with a fresh take or new angle. Posts should be fact based, and not mere opinion without a grounding in reality. The magic is in the details. Posts should be grounded in specifics, not just general pronouncements. If you say something is bad, you need to describe why; for example, what can or did happen because of it. Similarly, if you suggest best practices, the more specific examples you provide, the better. Links Links to outside content are encouraged, but just pointing to something on the web is not enough for a post, no matter how interesting the link is. You need to bring something unique to the post.",

      "body": "This doc explains how to use the Partnership API to manage accounts. For child accounts, you'd use the child account object. Requirements You may not be able to use some aspects of this object. Before using, first read the requirements. Account object attributes Here are the Partnership API account object's attributes. name (REQUIRED to create an account) Type: String Default: (none) The account name attribute is required for new accounts. This name must be unique in New Relic's database. If the specified name is not unique, it will be auto-incremented with a numeric suffix as follows: conflicting_name_1 conflicting_name_2 etc. Copy phone_number Type: String Default: (none) Primary contact phone number for the account. allow_api_access Type: Boolean Default: False This flag allows API access to application data. This must be set to true for partnerships remotely administering accounts. testing Type: Boolean Default: False Use this flag to indicate a test account. Test accounts are assumed to contain garbage data and are ignored by internal systems. The data they generate may be deleted at any time. users (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of users. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships who have switched to the New Relic One user model: do not define users. If you add users with this field, they will be ignored. Instead, to add users, you'd use these user management procedures. For all other accounts, which have users on our original user model: When you first create an account, this field is required, and only one user can be defined: the account Owner. To add additional users, use the Partnership API user object. For more on restrictions, read the Requirements. subscriptions (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of subscriptions. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships on our New Relic One pricing plan: ignore this field because it applies to the original pricing plan, not yours. If you use this, it will be ignored. For all other accounts: You are on our original product-based pricing plan. The subscriptions attribute is required for new accounts. If it is empty, default product tiers will be used. To update subscription information, use the Partnership API subscription object. Important When creating an account with this object, it can take some time for the account settings to populate. This means that the returned response may initially show aspects that are not true (for example, it may return a response showing default Lite subscriptions). To specify an empty JSON array, don't use subscriptions: [ {} ]. Instead, use this format: subscriptions: [ ] Copy The account API does not include an attribute to create a child account. Instead, to create child accounts, use the parent account's Account settings page in the New Relic UI. Account API calls Here are the URL patterns for account API functions. If using this URL pattern, send an HTTP header containing the Partner API key along with the JSON request body. For example: GET .../api/v2/partners/:PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID x-api-key: :PARTNER_ACCOUNT_KEY Content-Type: application/json { JSON data } Copy Call Resource URL pattern List (index) all accounts of a partner. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts Copy Show the attributes of an account. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Update the attributes of an account. PUT /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Create an account with the given parameters. POST /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts Copy Cancel an account. DELETE /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Status definitions When an account is created or listed with an API call, the account status is included automatically. Some of these statuses don't apply to all pricing plans. Account status Definition pending Free account created, but primary admin is not yet activated. paid_pending Account created with a paid subscription, but the primary admin is not yet activated. new Free account, active primary admin, no application data has been collected. paid_new Paid subscription, active primary admin, no application data has been collected. active Free subscription, receiving application data. paid_active Paid subscription, receiving application data. upgraded Account's subscription was upgraded. downgraded Account's subscription was downgraded. cancelled The New Relic account subscription has been cancelled. suspended The New Relic account has been suspended because the primary admin has not validated their email address. JSON example Here is an example of a JSON request and response using the Partnership API account object. Note that this is just an example, and that for some accounts, the users and subscriptions attributes are unnecessary and are ignored.

Before using the Partnership API, first read the requirements. Introduction to using child accounts Some notes about using the child account object: To manage existing parent accounts or child accounts, use the Partnership API account object. A parent account may have more than one associated child account, but every chld account must correspond to one and only one parent account. Every child account must have at least a primary_admin user. You cannot create a child account without connecting it to an existing parent account and adding at least one user. Child account object attributes Before using the Partnership API, first read the requirements. Here are the Partnership API child account object's attributes: name (REQUIRED) Type: String Default: (none) This name must be unique in New Relic's database. If the specified name is not unique, it will be auto-incremented with a numeric suffix as follows: conflicting_name_1 conflicting_name_2 etc. Copy allow_api_access Type: Boolean Default: False This flag allows API access to application data.

      "body": "New Relic's Partnership API includes functionality for partners to replace a customer's existing subscription with a new one, or to update invoice information for New Relic partner accounts. This is particularly useful for partners acting as resellers or managed service providers of New Relic accounts. For example, when customers of a New Relic reseller partner purchase a higher subscription level from New Relic's Sales team, New Relic replaces the old subscription with a new subscription. New Relic then uses the API to communicate this information to the partner. Requirements Before using this object, please read the Partnership API requirements. Communication endpoint Partners must implement a billing communication endpoint that identifies the partner's URL and PARTNER_ID. New Relic uses this endpoint to notify the partner that New Relic has made a change to a partner account's subscription or invoice information. The endpoint must support HTTPS. The partner-specified portion of the URL is identified from the Settings tab of New Relic's Partner Portal. The PARTNER_ID is the partner's external ID for this account. This value must be passed when the account is created by using the partner_external_identifier parameter. Billing API Supported functionality for the Partnership billing API includes: Customer subscription notification Invoice information notification Customer subscription notification API To communicate changes to a partner about a customer's subscription, New Relic uses the POST method with this URI: https://partner-specified/partner-specified/PARTNER_ID.json Copy Authentication is done via headers with the partner's REST API key or Admin user's API key. The Partnership API returns the results as JSON. Parameters: Name Type Description id String The customer's New Relic account ID subscription_id Integer Subscription's numeric ID subscription_string String Description of subscription for display price Integer Monthly price of subscription in cents number_of_hosts Integer Number of hosts starts Date Subscription's start date (yyyymmdd) expires Date Subscription's end date (yyyymmdd) Return codes: 200: Successfully updated. 404: Account not found. 422: Missing or invalid parameters. Authentication failed. Invoice notification API New Relic uses this endpoint to notify the partner of changes to a partner account's subscription level and invoice information. New Relic uses the PUT method with this URI: https://partner-specified/partner-specified/PARTNER_ID.json Copy OR https://partner-specified/partner-specified/PARTNER_ID.xml Copy The Partnership API returns the results as JSON or XML. Parameters: Name Type Description id string The customer's New Relic account ID subscription_id integer Subscription's numeric ID subscription_string string Description of subscription for display price integer Monthly price of subscription in cents Return codes: 200: Successfully updated. 404: Account not found. 422: Missing or invalid parameters.

      "body": "This doc explains how to use the Partnership API to manage child accounts. For accounts, you'd use the child account object. Requirements You may not have access to using this object. Before using the Partnership API, first read the requirements. Introduction to using child accounts Some notes about using the child account object: To manage existing parent accounts or child accounts, use the Partnership API account object. A parent account may have more than one associated child account, but every chld account must correspond to one and only one parent account. Every child account must have at least a primary_admin user. You cannot create a child account without connecting it to an existing parent account and adding at least one user. Child account object attributes Before using the Partnership API, first read the requirements. Here are the Partnership API child account object's attributes: name (REQUIRED) Type: String Default: (none) This name must be unique in New Relic's database. If the specified name is not unique, it will be auto-incremented with a numeric suffix as follows: conflicting_name_1 conflicting_name_2 etc. Copy allow_api_access Type: Boolean Default: False This flag allows API access to application data. This must be set to true for partnerships remotely administering accounts. testing Type: Boolean Default: False Use this flag to indicate a test account. Test accounts are assumed to contain garbage data and are ignored by internal systems. The data they generate may be deleted at any time. users (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of users. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships who have switched to the New Relic One user model: do not define users. If you add users with this field, they will be ignored. Instead, to add users, you'd use these user management procedures. For all other accounts, which have users on our original user model: When you create the child account, you can define only one user: the account Owner. To add additional users, use the Partnership API user object. For more about restrictions, read the Requirements. password (REQUIRED) Type: String Default: (none) If you are creating a child account with an existing user as the account Owner, the password must match the user's current password. For some New Relic organizations, child accounts can also be created via the parent account's Account settings page in the New Relic UI. Child account API calls Here is the URL pattern to create child accounts. Notice that the Parent Account ID must be specified. If using this URL pattern, send the JSON object along with an HTTP header containing the Partner API key. For example: POST .../api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/PARENT_ACCOUNT_ID/sub_accounts​ x-api-key:PARTNER_ACCOUNT_KEY Content-Type: application/json { JSON data } Copy Call Resource URL pattern Create a child account with the given parameters. POST /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/PARENT_ACCOUNT_ID/sub_accounts Copy JSON example Here is an example of a JSON request and response using the Partnership API child account object. Note that this is just an example, and that for some accounts, the users attribute is unnecessary and will be ignored.

Requirements For requirements, see Intro to Partnership API. Find your Partnership API key The Partnership API requires that you authenticate with the REST API key that is specific to your partnership owner account (you cannot use the other REST API keys). When using your Partnership API key with calls to REST API (v2) endpoints that require the use of an Admin user's API key, see Admin user's API Key and partnerships. Find your Partner ID The Partnership API also requires that you authenticate by providing a Partner ID specific to your partnership. This is unique from the account ID for your partnership owner account. To obtain your Partner ID, go to your partner admin console and retrieve the partner ID number that is listed in your URL: https://partner-admin-console.newrelic.com/accounts/​$ACCOUNT_ID/admin_console/partnerships/$PARTNER_ID Copy You must include the Partner ID as part of the base URL for the Partner API.

Include your Partner ID at the specified point in the request URI. Notes for partners who manage New Relic accounts For partners who manage New Relic accounts for their customers, the initial API call for all account-level interactions is to \"create account.\" This call returns an xml record of the newly created account. Part of this record is the account_id. All of the other calls in the Partnership API require the account_id as a parameter. Provision will need to be made by the partner to parse the returned xml extract, store the account_id, and associate it with the users' partner account record. Errors New Relic uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the 2xx range indicate success and codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that resulted from the provided information (for example, a required parameter was missing). Error Probable cause 400 Bad Request Most commonly the call is missing a required parameter. 401 Unauthorized A valid API key was not provided. 402 Request Failed Parameters were valid but request failed for some reason. 404 Not Found The requested item doesn't exist. 422 Unprocessable Entity Your account has special terms and cannot be changed.",

      "body": "This doc explains how to use the Partnership API to manage child accounts. For accounts, you'd use the child account object. Requirements You may not have access to using this object. Before using the Partnership API, first read the requirements. Introduction to using child accounts Some notes about using the child account object: To manage existing parent accounts or child accounts, use the Partnership API account object. A parent account may have more than one associated child account, but every chld account must correspond to one and only one parent account. Every child account must have at least a primary_admin user. You cannot create a child account without connecting it to an existing parent account and adding at least one user. Child account object attributes Before using the Partnership API, first read the requirements. Here are the Partnership API child account object's attributes: name (REQUIRED) Type: String Default: (none) This name must be unique in New Relic's database. If the specified name is not unique, it will be auto-incremented with a numeric suffix as follows: conflicting_name_1 conflicting_name_2 etc. Copy allow_api_access Type: Boolean Default: False This flag allows API access to application data. This must be set to true for partnerships remotely administering accounts. testing Type: Boolean Default: False Use this flag to indicate a test account. Test accounts are assumed to contain garbage data and are ignored by internal systems. The data they generate may be deleted at any time. users (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of users. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships who have switched to the New Relic One user model: do not define users. If you add users with this field, they will be ignored. Instead, to add users, you'd use these user management procedures. For all other accounts, which have users on our original user model: When you create the child account, you can define only one user: the account Owner. To add additional users, use the Partnership API user object. For more about restrictions, read the Requirements. password (REQUIRED) Type: String Default: (none) If you are creating a child account with an existing user as the account Owner, the password must match the user's current password. For some New Relic organizations, child accounts can also be created via the parent account's Account settings page in the New Relic UI. Child account API calls Here is the URL pattern to create child accounts. Notice that the Parent Account ID must be specified. If using this URL pattern, send the JSON object along with an HTTP header containing the Partner API key. For example: POST .../api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/PARENT_ACCOUNT_ID/sub_accounts​ x-api-key:PARTNER_ACCOUNT_KEY Content-Type: application/json { JSON data } Copy Call Resource URL pattern Create a child account with the given parameters. POST /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/PARENT_ACCOUNT_ID/sub_accounts Copy JSON example Here is an example of a JSON request and response using the Partnership API child account object.

      "body": "New Relic's Partnership API includes functionality for partners to replace a customer's existing subscription with a new one, or to update invoice information for New Relic partner accounts. This is particularly useful for partners acting as resellers or managed service providers of New Relic accounts. For example, when customers of a New Relic reseller partner purchase a higher subscription level from New Relic's Sales team, New Relic replaces the old subscription with a new subscription. New Relic then uses the API to communicate this information to the partner. Requirements Before using this object, please read the Partnership API requirements. Communication endpoint Partners must implement a billing communication endpoint that identifies the partner's URL and PARTNER_ID. New Relic uses this endpoint to notify the partner that New Relic has made a change to a partner account's subscription or invoice information. The endpoint must support HTTPS. The partner-specified portion of the URL is identified from the Settings tab of New Relic's Partner Portal. The PARTNER_ID is the partner's external ID for this account. This value must be passed when the account is created by using the partner_external_identifier parameter. Billing API Supported functionality for the Partnership billing API includes: Customer subscription notification Invoice information notification Customer subscription notification API To communicate changes to a partner about a customer's subscription, New Relic uses the POST method with this URI: https://partner-specified/partner-specified/PARTNER_ID.json Copy Authentication is done via headers with the partner's REST API key or Admin user's API key. The Partnership API returns the results as JSON. Parameters: Name Type Description id String The customer's New Relic account ID subscription_id Integer Subscription's numeric ID subscription_string String Description of subscription for display price Integer Monthly price of subscription in cents number_of_hosts Integer Number of hosts starts Date Subscription's start date (yyyymmdd) expires Date Subscription's end date (yyyymmdd) Return codes: 200: Successfully updated. 404: Account not found. 422: Missing or invalid parameters. Authentication failed. Invoice notification API New Relic uses this endpoint to notify the partner of changes to a partner account's subscription level and invoice information. New Relic uses the PUT method with this URI: https://partner-specified/partner-specified/PARTNER_ID.json Copy OR https://partner-specified/partner-specified/PARTNER_ID.xml Copy The Partnership API returns the results as JSON or XML. Parameters: Name Type Description id string The customer's New Relic account ID subscription_id integer Subscription's numeric ID subscription_string string Description of subscription for display price integer Monthly price of subscription in cents Return codes: 200: Successfully updated. 404: Account not found. 422: Missing or invalid parameters.

      "body": "This doc explains how to use the Partnership API to manage accounts. For child accounts, you'd use the child account object. Requirements You may not be able to use some aspects of this object. Before using, first read the requirements. Account object attributes Here are the Partnership API account object's attributes. name (REQUIRED to create an account) Type: String Default: (none) The account name attribute is required for new accounts. This name must be unique in New Relic's database. If the specified name is not unique, it will be auto-incremented with a numeric suffix as follows: conflicting_name_1 conflicting_name_2 etc. Copy phone_number Type: String Default: (none) Primary contact phone number for the account. allow_api_access Type: Boolean Default: False This flag allows API access to application data. This must be set to true for partnerships remotely administering accounts. testing Type: Boolean Default: False Use this flag to indicate a test account. Test accounts are assumed to contain garbage data and are ignored by internal systems. The data they generate may be deleted at any time. users (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of users. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships who have switched to the New Relic One user model: do not define users. If you add users with this field, they will be ignored. Instead, to add users, you'd use these user management procedures. For all other accounts, which have users on our original user model: When you first create an account, this field is required, and only one user can be defined: the account Owner. To add additional users, use the Partnership API user object. For more on restrictions, read the Requirements. subscriptions (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of subscriptions. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships on our New Relic One pricing plan: ignore this field because it applies to the original pricing plan, not yours. If you use this, it will be ignored. For all other accounts: You are on our original product-based pricing plan. The subscriptions attribute is required for new accounts. If it is empty, default product tiers will be used. To update subscription information, use the Partnership API subscription object. Important When creating an account with this object, it can take some time for the account settings to populate. This means that the returned response may initially show aspects that are not true (for example, it may return a response showing default Lite subscriptions). To specify an empty JSON array, don't use subscriptions: [ {} ]. Instead, use this format: subscriptions: [ ] Copy The account API does not include an attribute to create a child account. Instead, to create child accounts, use the parent account's Account settings page in the New Relic UI. Account API calls Here are the URL patterns for account API functions. If using this URL pattern, send an HTTP header containing the Partner API key along with the JSON request body. For example: GET .../api/v2/partners/:PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID x-api-key: :PARTNER_ACCOUNT_KEY Content-Type: application/json { JSON data } Copy Call Resource URL pattern List (index) all accounts of a partner. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts Copy Show the attributes of an account. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Update the attributes of an account. PUT /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Create an account with the given parameters. POST /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts Copy Cancel an account. DELETE /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Status definitions When an account is created or listed with an API call, the account status is included automatically. Some of these statuses don't apply to all pricing plans. Account status Definition pending Free account created, but primary admin is not yet activated. paid_pending Account created with a paid subscription, but the primary admin is not yet activated. new Free account, active primary admin, no application data has been collected. paid_new Paid subscription, active primary admin, no application data has been collected. active Free subscription, receiving application data. paid_active Paid subscription, receiving application data. upgraded Account's subscription was upgraded. downgraded Account's subscription was downgraded. cancelled The New Relic account subscription has been cancelled. suspended The New Relic account has been suspended because the primary admin has not validated their email address. JSON example Here is an example of a JSON request and response using the Partnership API account object. Note that this is just an example, and that for some accounts, the users and subscriptions attributes are unnecessary and are ignored.

      "body": "New Relic's Partnership API includes functionality for partners to replace a customer's existing subscription with a new one, or to update invoice information for New Relic partner accounts. This is particularly useful for partners acting as resellers or managed service providers of New Relic accounts. For example, when customers of a New Relic reseller partner purchase a higher subscription level from New Relic's Sales team, New Relic replaces the old subscription with a new subscription. New Relic then uses the API to communicate this information to the partner. Requirements Before using this object, please read the Partnership API requirements. Communication endpoint Partners must implement a billing communication endpoint that identifies the partner's URL and PARTNER_ID. New Relic uses this endpoint to notify the partner that New Relic has made a change to a partner account's subscription or invoice information. The endpoint must support HTTPS. The partner-specified portion of the URL is identified from the Settings tab of New Relic's Partner Portal. The PARTNER_ID is the partner's external ID for this account. This value must be passed when the account is created by using the partner_external_identifier parameter. Billing API Supported functionality for the Partnership billing API includes: Customer subscription notification Invoice information notification Customer subscription notification API To communicate changes to a partner about a customer's subscription, New Relic uses the POST method with this URI: https://partner-specified/partner-specified/PARTNER_ID.json Copy Authentication is done via headers with the partner's REST API key or Admin user's API key. The Partnership API returns the results as JSON. Parameters: Name Type Description id String The customer's New Relic account ID subscription_id Integer Subscription's numeric ID subscription_string String Description of subscription for display price Integer Monthly price of subscription in cents number_of_hosts Integer Number of hosts starts Date Subscription's start date (yyyymmdd) expires Date Subscription's end date (yyyymmdd) Return codes: 200: Successfully updated. 404: Account not found. 422: Missing or invalid parameters. Authentication failed. Invoice notification API New Relic uses this endpoint to notify the partner of changes to a partner account's subscription level and invoice information. New Relic uses the PUT method with this URI: https://partner-specified/partner-specified/PARTNER_ID.json Copy OR https://partner-specified/partner-specified/PARTNER_ID.xml Copy The Partnership API returns the results as JSON or XML. Parameters: Name Type Description id string The customer's New Relic account ID subscription_id integer Subscription's numeric ID subscription_string string Description of subscription for display price integer Monthly price of subscription in cents Return codes: 200: Successfully updated. 404: Account not found. 422: Missing or invalid parameters.

Requirements For requirements, see Intro to Partnership API. Find your Partnership API key The Partnership API requires that you authenticate with the REST API key that is specific to your partnership owner account (you cannot use the other REST API keys). When using your Partnership API key with calls to REST API (v2) endpoints that require the use of an Admin user's API key, see Admin user's API Key and partnerships. Find your Partner ID The Partnership API also requires that you authenticate by providing a Partner ID specific to your partnership. This is unique from the account ID for your partnership owner account. To obtain your Partner ID, go to your partner admin console and retrieve the partner ID number that is listed in your URL: https://partner-admin-console.newrelic.com/accounts/​$ACCOUNT_ID/admin_console/partnerships/$PARTNER_ID Copy You must include the Partner ID as part of the base URL for the Partner API.

Include your Partner ID at the specified point in the request URI. Notes for partners who manage New Relic accounts For partners who manage New Relic accounts for their customers, the initial API call for all account-level interactions is to \"create account.\" This call returns an xml record of the newly created account. Part of this record is the account_id. All of the other calls in the Partnership API require the account_id as a parameter. Provision will need to be made by the partner to parse the returned xml extract, store the account_id, and associate it with the users' partner account record. Errors New Relic uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the 2xx range indicate success and codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that resulted from the provided information (for example, a required parameter was missing). Error Probable cause 400 Bad Request Most commonly the call is missing a required parameter. 401 Unauthorized A valid API key was not provided. 402 Request Failed Parameters were valid but request failed for some reason. 404 Not Found The requested item doesn't exist. 422 Unprocessable Entity Your account has special terms and cannot be changed.",

      "body": "This doc explains how to use the Partnership API to manage accounts. For child accounts, you'd use the child account object. Requirements You may not be able to use some aspects of this object. Before using, first read the requirements. Account object attributes Here are the Partnership API account object's attributes. name (REQUIRED to create an account) Type: String Default: (none) The account name attribute is required for new accounts. This name must be unique in New Relic's database. If the specified name is not unique, it will be auto-incremented with a numeric suffix as follows: conflicting_name_1 conflicting_name_2 etc. Copy phone_number Type: String Default: (none) Primary contact phone number for the account. allow_api_access Type: Boolean Default: False This flag allows API access to application data. This must be set to true for partnerships remotely administering accounts. testing Type: Boolean Default: False Use this flag to indicate a test account. Test accounts are assumed to contain garbage data and are ignored by internal systems. The data they generate may be deleted at any time. users (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of users. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships who have switched to the New Relic One user model: do not define users. If you add users with this field, they will be ignored. Instead, to add users, you'd use these user management procedures. For all other accounts, which have users on our original user model: When you first create an account, this field is required, and only one user can be defined: the account Owner. To add additional users, use the Partnership API user object. For more on restrictions, read the Requirements. subscriptions (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of subscriptions. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships on our New Relic One pricing plan: ignore this field because it applies to the original pricing plan, not yours. If you use this, it will be ignored. For all other accounts: You are on our original product-based pricing plan. The subscriptions attribute is required for new accounts. If it is empty, default product tiers will be used. To update subscription information, use the Partnership API subscription object. Important When creating an account with this object, it can take some time for the account settings to populate. This means that the returned response may initially show aspects that are not true (for example, it may return a response showing default Lite subscriptions). To specify an empty JSON array, don't use subscriptions: [ {} ]. Instead, use this format: subscriptions: [ ] Copy The account API does not include an attribute to create a child account. Instead, to create child accounts, use the parent account's Account settings page in the New Relic UI. Account API calls Here are the URL patterns for account API functions. If using this URL pattern, send an HTTP header containing the Partner API key along with the JSON request body. For example: GET .../api/v2/partners/:PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID x-api-key: :PARTNER_ACCOUNT_KEY Content-Type: application/json { JSON data } Copy Call Resource URL pattern List (index) all accounts of a partner. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts Copy Show the attributes of an account. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Update the attributes of an account. PUT /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Create an account with the given parameters. POST /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts Copy Cancel an account. DELETE /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Status definitions When an account is created or listed with an API call, the account status is included automatically. Some of these statuses don't apply to all pricing plans. Account status Definition pending Free account created, but primary admin is not yet activated. paid_pending Account created with a paid subscription, but the primary admin is not yet activated. new Free account, active primary admin, no application data has been collected. paid_new Paid subscription, active primary admin, no application data has been collected. active Free subscription, receiving application data. paid_active Paid subscription, receiving application data. upgraded Account's subscription was upgraded. downgraded Account's subscription was downgraded. cancelled The New Relic account subscription has been cancelled. suspended The New Relic account has been suspended because the primary admin has not validated their email address. JSON example Here is an example of a JSON request and response using the Partnership API account object. Note that this is just an example, and that for some accounts, the users and subscriptions attributes are unnecessary and are ignored.

Before using the Partnership API, first read the requirements. Introduction to using child accounts Some notes about using the child account object: To manage existing parent accounts or child accounts, use the Partnership API account object. A parent account may have more than one associated child account, but every chld account must correspond to one and only one parent account. Every child account must have at least a primary_admin user. You cannot create a child account without connecting it to an existing parent account and adding at least one user. Child account object attributes Before using the Partnership API, first read the requirements. Here are the Partnership API child account object's attributes: name (REQUIRED) Type: String Default: (none) This name must be unique in New Relic's database. If the specified name is not unique, it will be auto-incremented with a numeric suffix as follows: conflicting_name_1 conflicting_name_2 etc. Copy allow_api_access Type: Boolean Default: False This flag allows API access to application data.

      "body": "New Relic's Partnership API includes functionality for partners to replace a customer's existing subscription with a new one, or to update invoice information for New Relic partner accounts. This is particularly useful for partners acting as resellers or managed service providers of New Relic accounts. For example, when customers of a New Relic reseller partner purchase a higher subscription level from New Relic's Sales team, New Relic replaces the old subscription with a new subscription. New Relic then uses the API to communicate this information to the partner. Requirements Before using this object, please read the Partnership API requirements. Communication endpoint Partners must implement a billing communication endpoint that identifies the partner's URL and PARTNER_ID. New Relic uses this endpoint to notify the partner that New Relic has made a change to a partner account's subscription or invoice information. The endpoint must support HTTPS. The partner-specified portion of the URL is identified from the Settings tab of New Relic's Partner Portal. The PARTNER_ID is the partner's external ID for this account. This value must be passed when the account is created by using the partner_external_identifier parameter. Billing API Supported functionality for the Partnership billing API includes: Customer subscription notification Invoice information notification Customer subscription notification API To communicate changes to a partner about a customer's subscription, New Relic uses the POST method with this URI: https://partner-specified/partner-specified/PARTNER_ID.json Copy Authentication is done via headers with the partner's REST API key or Admin user's API key. The Partnership API returns the results as JSON. Parameters: Name Type Description id String The customer's New Relic account ID subscription_id Integer Subscription's numeric ID subscription_string String Description of subscription for display price Integer Monthly price of subscription in cents number_of_hosts Integer Number of hosts starts Date Subscription's start date (yyyymmdd) expires Date Subscription's end date (yyyymmdd) Return codes: 200: Successfully updated. 404: Account not found. 422: Missing or invalid parameters. Authentication failed. Invoice notification API New Relic uses this endpoint to notify the partner of changes to a partner account's subscription level and invoice information. New Relic uses the PUT method with this URI: https://partner-specified/partner-specified/PARTNER_ID.json Copy OR https://partner-specified/partner-specified/PARTNER_ID.xml Copy The Partnership API returns the results as JSON or XML.

      "body": "This doc explains how to use the Partnership API to manage accounts. For child accounts, you'd use the child account object. Requirements You may not be able to use some aspects of this object. Before using, first read the requirements. Account object attributes Here are the Partnership API account object's attributes. name (REQUIRED to create an account) Type: String Default: (none) The account name attribute is required for new accounts. This name must be unique in New Relic's database. If the specified name is not unique, it will be auto-incremented with a numeric suffix as follows: conflicting_name_1 conflicting_name_2 etc. Copy phone_number Type: String Default: (none) Primary contact phone number for the account. allow_api_access Type: Boolean Default: False This flag allows API access to application data. This must be set to true for partnerships remotely administering accounts. testing Type: Boolean Default: False Use this flag to indicate a test account. Test accounts are assumed to contain garbage data and are ignored by internal systems. The data they generate may be deleted at any time. users (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of users. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships who have switched to the New Relic One user model: do not define users. If you add users with this field, they will be ignored. Instead, to add users, you'd use these user management procedures. For all other accounts, which have users on our original user model: When you first create an account, this field is required, and only one user can be defined: the account Owner. To add additional users, use the Partnership API user object. For more on restrictions, read the Requirements. subscriptions (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of subscriptions. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships on our New Relic One pricing plan: ignore this field because it applies to the original pricing plan, not yours. If you use this, it will be ignored. For all other accounts: You are on our original product-based pricing plan. The subscriptions attribute is required for new accounts. If it is empty, default product tiers will be used. To update subscription information, use the Partnership API subscription object. Important When creating an account with this object, it can take some time for the account settings to populate. This means that the returned response may initially show aspects that are not true (for example, it may return a response showing default Lite subscriptions). To specify an empty JSON array, don't use subscriptions: [ {} ]. Instead, use this format: subscriptions: [ ] Copy The account API does not include an attribute to create a child account. Instead, to create child accounts, use the parent account's Account settings page in the New Relic UI. Account API calls Here are the URL patterns for account API functions. If using this URL pattern, send an HTTP header containing the Partner API key along with the JSON request body. For example: GET .../api/v2/partners/:PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID x-api-key: :PARTNER_ACCOUNT_KEY Content-Type: application/json { JSON data } Copy Call Resource URL pattern List (index) all accounts of a partner. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts Copy Show the attributes of an account. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Update the attributes of an account. PUT /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Create an account with the given parameters. POST /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts Copy Cancel an account. DELETE /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Status definitions When an account is created or listed with an API call, the account status is included automatically. Some of these statuses don't apply to all pricing plans. Account status Definition pending Free account created, but primary admin is not yet activated. paid_pending Account created with a paid subscription, but the primary admin is not yet activated. new Free account, active primary admin, no application data has been collected. paid_new Paid subscription, active primary admin, no application data has been collected. active Free subscription, receiving application data. paid_active Paid subscription, receiving application data. upgraded Account's subscription was upgraded. downgraded Account's subscription was downgraded. cancelled The New Relic account subscription has been cancelled. suspended The New Relic account has been suspended because the primary admin has not validated their email address. JSON example Here is an example of a JSON request and response using the Partnership API account object. Note that this is just an example, and that for some accounts, the users and subscriptions attributes are unnecessary and are ignored.

Before using the Partnership API, first read the requirements. Introduction to using child accounts Some notes about using the child account object: To manage existing parent accounts or child accounts, use the Partnership API account object. A parent account may have more than one associated child account, but every chld account must correspond to one and only one parent account. Every child account must have at least a primary_admin user. You cannot create a child account without connecting it to an existing parent account and adding at least one user. Child account object attributes Before using the Partnership API, first read the requirements. Here are the Partnership API child account object's attributes: name (REQUIRED) Type: String Default: (none) This name must be unique in New Relic's database. If the specified name is not unique, it will be auto-incremented with a numeric suffix as follows: conflicting_name_1 conflicting_name_2 etc. Copy allow_api_access Type: Boolean Default: False This flag allows API access to application data.

      "body": "New Relic's Partnership API includes functionality for partners to replace a customer's existing subscription with a new one, or to update invoice information for New Relic partner accounts. This is particularly useful for partners acting as resellers or managed service providers of New Relic accounts. For example, when customers of a New Relic reseller partner purchase a higher subscription level from New Relic's Sales team, New Relic replaces the old subscription with a new subscription. New Relic then uses the API to communicate this information to the partner. Requirements Before using this object, please read the Partnership API requirements. Communication endpoint Partners must implement a billing communication endpoint that identifies the partner's URL and PARTNER_ID. New Relic uses this endpoint to notify the partner that New Relic has made a change to a partner account's subscription or invoice information. The endpoint must support HTTPS. The partner-specified portion of the URL is identified from the Settings tab of New Relic's Partner Portal. The PARTNER_ID is the partner's external ID for this account. This value must be passed when the account is created by using the partner_external_identifier parameter. Billing API Supported functionality for the Partnership billing API includes: Customer subscription notification Invoice information notification Customer subscription notification API To communicate changes to a partner about a customer's subscription, New Relic uses the POST method with this URI: https://partner-specified/partner-specified/PARTNER_ID.json Copy Authentication is done via headers with the partner's REST API key or Admin user's API key. The Partnership API returns the results as JSON. Parameters: Name Type Description id String The customer's New Relic account ID subscription_id Integer Subscription's numeric ID subscription_string String Description of subscription for display price Integer Monthly price of subscription in cents number_of_hosts Integer Number of hosts starts Date Subscription's start date (yyyymmdd) expires Date Subscription's end date (yyyymmdd) Return codes: 200: Successfully updated. 404: Account not found. 422: Missing or invalid parameters. Authentication failed. Invoice notification API New Relic uses this endpoint to notify the partner of changes to a partner account's subscription level and invoice information. New Relic uses the PUT method with this URI: https://partner-specified/partner-specified/PARTNER_ID.json Copy OR https://partner-specified/partner-specified/PARTNER_ID.xml Copy The Partnership API returns the results as JSON or XML. Parameters: Name Type Description id string The customer's New Relic account ID subscription_id integer Subscription's numeric ID subscription_string string Description of subscription for display price integer Monthly price of subscription in cents Return codes: 200: Successfully updated. 404: Account not found. 422: Missing or invalid parameters.

      "body": "This doc explains how to use the Partnership API to manage accounts. For child accounts, you'd use the child account object. Requirements You may not be able to use some aspects of this object. Before using, first read the requirements. Account object attributes Here are the Partnership API account object's attributes. name (REQUIRED to create an account) Type: String Default: (none) The account name attribute is required for new accounts. This name must be unique in New Relic's database. If the specified name is not unique, it will be auto-incremented with a numeric suffix as follows: conflicting_name_1 conflicting_name_2 etc. Copy phone_number Type: String Default: (none) Primary contact phone number for the account. allow_api_access Type: Boolean Default: False This flag allows API access to application data. This must be set to true for partnerships remotely administering accounts. testing Type: Boolean Default: False Use this flag to indicate a test account. Test accounts are assumed to contain garbage data and are ignored by internal systems. The data they generate may be deleted at any time. users (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of users. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships who have switched to the New Relic One user model: do not define users. If you add users with this field, they will be ignored. Instead, to add users, you'd use these user management procedures. For all other accounts, which have users on our original user model: When you first create an account, this field is required, and only one user can be defined: the account Owner. To add additional users, use the Partnership API user object. For more on restrictions, read the Requirements. subscriptions (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of subscriptions. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships on our New Relic One pricing plan: ignore this field because it applies to the original pricing plan, not yours. If you use this, it will be ignored. For all other accounts: You are on our original product-based pricing plan. The subscriptions attribute is required for new accounts. If it is empty, default product tiers will be used. To update subscription information, use the Partnership API subscription object. Important When creating an account with this object, it can take some time for the account settings to populate. This means that the returned response may initially show aspects that are not true (for example, it may return a response showing default Lite subscriptions). To specify an empty JSON array, don't use subscriptions: [ {} ]. Instead, use this format: subscriptions: [ ] Copy The account API does not include an attribute to create a child account. Instead, to create child accounts, use the parent account's Account settings page in the New Relic UI. Account API calls Here are the URL patterns for account API functions. If using this URL pattern, send an HTTP header containing the Partner API key along with the JSON request body. For example: GET .../api/v2/partners/:PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID x-api-key: :PARTNER_ACCOUNT_KEY Content-Type: application/json { JSON data } Copy Call Resource URL pattern List (index) all accounts of a partner. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts Copy Show the attributes of an account. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Update the attributes of an account. PUT /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Create an account with the given parameters. POST /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts Copy Cancel an account. DELETE /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Status definitions When an account is created or listed with an API call, the account status is included automatically. Some of these statuses don't apply to all pricing plans. Account status Definition pending Free account created, but primary admin is not yet activated. paid_pending Account created with a paid subscription, but the primary admin is not yet activated. new Free account, active primary admin, no application data has been collected. paid_new Paid subscription, active primary admin, no application data has been collected. active Free subscription, receiving application data. paid_active Paid subscription, receiving application data. upgraded Account's subscription was upgraded. downgraded Account's subscription was downgraded. cancelled The New Relic account subscription has been cancelled. suspended The New Relic account has been suspended because the primary admin has not validated their email address. JSON example Here is an example of a JSON request and response using the Partnership API account object. Note that this is just an example, and that for some accounts, the users and subscriptions attributes are unnecessary and are ignored.

Before using the Partnership API, first read the requirements. Introduction to using child accounts Some notes about using the child account object: To manage existing parent accounts or child accounts, use the Partnership API account object. A parent account may have more than one associated child account, but every chld account must correspond to one and only one parent account. Every child account must have at least a primary_admin user. You cannot create a child account without connecting it to an existing parent account and adding at least one user. Child account object attributes Before using the Partnership API, first read the requirements. Here are the Partnership API child account object's attributes: name (REQUIRED) Type: String Default: (none) This name must be unique in New Relic's database. If the specified name is not unique, it will be auto-incremented with a numeric suffix as follows: conflicting_name_1 conflicting_name_2 etc. Copy allow_api_access Type: Boolean Default: False This flag allows API access to application data. This must be set to true for partnerships remotely administering accounts. testing Type: Boolean Default: False Use this flag to indicate a test account. Test accounts are assumed to contain garbage data and are ignored by internal systems. The data they generate may be deleted at any time. users (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of users. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships who have switched to the New Relic One user model: do not define users. If you add users with this field, they will be ignored. Instead, to add users, you'd use these user management procedures. For all other accounts, which have users on our original user model: When you create the child account, you can define only one user: the account Owner. To add additional users, use the Partnership API user object. For more about restrictions, read the Requirements. password (REQUIRED) Type: String Default: (none) If you are creating a child account with an existing user as the account Owner, the password must match the user's current password. For some New Relic organizations, child accounts can also be created via the parent account's Account settings page in the New Relic UI. Child account API calls Here is the URL pattern to create child accounts. Notice that the Parent Account ID must be specified. If using this URL pattern, send the JSON object along with an HTTP header containing the Partner API key. For example: POST .../api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/PARENT_ACCOUNT_ID/sub_accounts​ x-api-key:PARTNER_ACCOUNT_KEY Content-Type: application/json { JSON data } Copy Call Resource URL pattern Create a child account with the given parameters.

      "body": "This doc explains technical details about using the Partnership API. For an introduction and requirements, first read Intro to Partnership API. Requirements For requirements, see Intro to Partnership API. Find your Partnership API key The Partnership API requires that you authenticate with the REST API key that is specific to your partnership owner account (you cannot use the other REST API keys). When using your Partnership API key with calls to REST API (v2) endpoints that require the use of an Admin user's API key, see Admin user's API Key and partnerships. Find your Partner ID The Partnership API also requires that you authenticate by providing a Partner ID specific to your partnership. This is unique from the account ID for your partnership owner account. To obtain your Partner ID, go to your partner admin console and retrieve the partner ID number that is listed in your URL: https://partner-admin-console.newrelic.com/accounts/​$ACCOUNT_ID/admin_console/partnerships/$PARTNER_ID Copy You must include the Partner ID as part of the base URL for the Partner API. URL component URL pattern Partner API endpoint https://rpm.newrelic.com/api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID Copy Resource URL patterns /accounts /accounts/ACCOUNT_ID /accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/users /accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/users/USER_ID /accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/subscriptions /accounts/ACCOUNT_ID/subscriptions/SUBSCRIPTION_ID Copy Example https://rpm.newrelic.com/api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/ACCOUNT_ID Copy Authenticate the API call To authenticate to the Partner API when making an API call: Add a request header labeled x-api-key and set its value to your Partner API key. Include your Partner ID at the specified point in the request URI. Notes for partners who manage New Relic accounts For partners who manage New Relic accounts for their customers, the initial API call for all account-level interactions is to \"create account.\" This call returns an xml record of the newly created account. Part of this record is the account_id. All of the other calls in the Partnership API require the account_id as a parameter. Provision will need to be made by the partner to parse the returned xml extract, store the account_id, and associate it with the users' partner account record. Errors New Relic uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the 2xx range indicate success and codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that resulted from the provided information (for example, a required parameter was missing). Error Probable cause 400 Bad Request Most commonly the call is missing a required parameter. 401 Unauthorized A valid API key was not provided. 402 Request Failed Parameters were valid but request failed for some reason. 404 Not Found The requested item doesn't exist. 422 Unprocessable Entity Your account has special terms and cannot be changed.",

      "body": "This doc explains how to use the Partnership API to manage accounts. For child accounts, you'd use the child account object. Requirements You may not be able to use some aspects of this object. Before using, first read the requirements. Account object attributes Here are the Partnership API account object's attributes. name (REQUIRED to create an account) Type: String Default: (none) The account name attribute is required for new accounts. This name must be unique in New Relic's database. If the specified name is not unique, it will be auto-incremented with a numeric suffix as follows: conflicting_name_1 conflicting_name_2 etc. Copy phone_number Type: String Default: (none) Primary contact phone number for the account. allow_api_access Type: Boolean Default: False This flag allows API access to application data. This must be set to true for partnerships remotely administering accounts. testing Type: Boolean Default: False Use this flag to indicate a test account. Test accounts are assumed to contain garbage data and are ignored by internal systems. The data they generate may be deleted at any time. users (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of users. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships who have switched to the New Relic One user model: do not define users. If you add users with this field, they will be ignored. Instead, to add users, you'd use these user management procedures. For all other accounts, which have users on our original user model: When you first create an account, this field is required, and only one user can be defined: the account Owner. To add additional users, use the Partnership API user object. For more on restrictions, read the Requirements. subscriptions (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of subscriptions. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships on our New Relic One pricing plan: ignore this field because it applies to the original pricing plan, not yours. If you use this, it will be ignored. For all other accounts: You are on our original product-based pricing plan. The subscriptions attribute is required for new accounts. If it is empty, default product tiers will be used. To update subscription information, use the Partnership API subscription object. Important When creating an account with this object, it can take some time for the account settings to populate. This means that the returned response may initially show aspects that are not true (for example, it may return a response showing default Lite subscriptions). To specify an empty JSON array, don't use subscriptions: [ {} ]. Instead, use this format: subscriptions: [ ] Copy The account API does not include an attribute to create a child account. Instead, to create child accounts, use the parent account's Account settings page in the New Relic UI. Account API calls Here are the URL patterns for account API functions. If using this URL pattern, send an HTTP header containing the Partner API key along with the JSON request body. For example: GET .../api/v2/partners/:PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID x-api-key: :PARTNER_ACCOUNT_KEY Content-Type: application/json { JSON data } Copy Call Resource URL pattern List (index) all accounts of a partner. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts Copy Show the attributes of an account. GET /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Update the attributes of an account. PUT /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Create an account with the given parameters. POST /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts Copy Cancel an account. DELETE /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/:ID Copy Status definitions When an account is created or listed with an API call, the account status is included automatically. Some of these statuses don't apply to all pricing plans. Account status Definition pending Free account created, but primary admin is not yet activated. paid_pending Account created with a paid subscription, but the primary admin is not yet activated. new Free account, active primary admin, no application data has been collected. paid_new Paid subscription, active primary admin, no application data has been collected. active Free subscription, receiving application data. paid_active Paid subscription, receiving application data. upgraded Account's subscription was upgraded. downgraded Account's subscription was downgraded. cancelled The New Relic account subscription has been cancelled. suspended The New Relic account has been suspended because the primary admin has not validated their email address.

      "body": "This doc explains how to use the Partnership API to manage child accounts. For accounts, you'd use the child account object. Requirements You may not have access to using this object. Before using the Partnership API, first read the requirements. Introduction to using child accounts Some notes about using the child account object: To manage existing parent accounts or child accounts, use the Partnership API account object. A parent account may have more than one associated child account, but every chld account must correspond to one and only one parent account. Every child account must have at least a primary_admin user. You cannot create a child account without connecting it to an existing parent account and adding at least one user. Child account object attributes Before using the Partnership API, first read the requirements. Here are the Partnership API child account object's attributes: name (REQUIRED) Type: String Default: (none) This name must be unique in New Relic's database. If the specified name is not unique, it will be auto-incremented with a numeric suffix as follows: conflicting_name_1 conflicting_name_2 etc. Copy allow_api_access Type: Boolean Default: False This flag allows API access to application data. This must be set to true for partnerships remotely administering accounts. testing Type: Boolean Default: False Use this flag to indicate a test account. Test accounts are assumed to contain garbage data and are ignored by internal systems. The data they generate may be deleted at any time. users (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of users. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships who have switched to the New Relic One user model: do not define users. If you add users with this field, they will be ignored. Instead, to add users, you'd use these user management procedures. For all other accounts, which have users on our original user model: When you create the child account, you can define only one user: the account Owner. To add additional users, use the Partnership API user object. For more about restrictions, read the Requirements. password (REQUIRED) Type: String Default: (none) If you are creating a child account with an existing user as the account Owner, the password must match the user's current password. For some New Relic organizations, child accounts can also be created via the parent account's Account settings page in the New Relic UI. Child account API calls Here is the URL pattern to create child accounts. Notice that the Parent Account ID must be specified. If using this URL pattern, send the JSON object along with an HTTP header containing the Partner API key. For example: POST .../api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/PARENT_ACCOUNT_ID/sub_accounts​ x-api-key:PARTNER_ACCOUNT_KEY Content-Type: application/json { JSON data } Copy Call Resource URL pattern Create a child account with the given parameters. POST /api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/PARENT_ACCOUNT_ID/sub_accounts Copy JSON example Here is an example of a JSON request and response using the Partnership API child account object. Note that this is just an example, and that for some accounts, the users attribute is unnecessary and will be ignored.

      "body": "New Relic's Partnership API includes functionality for partners to replace a customer's existing subscription with a new one, or to update invoice information for New Relic partner accounts. This is particularly useful for partners acting as resellers or managed service providers of New Relic accounts. For example, when customers of a New Relic reseller partner purchase a higher subscription level from New Relic's Sales team, New Relic replaces the old subscription with a new subscription. New Relic then uses the API to communicate this information to the partner. Requirements Before using this object, please read the Partnership API requirements. Communication endpoint Partners must implement a billing communication endpoint that identifies the partner's URL and PARTNER_ID. New Relic uses this endpoint to notify the partner that New Relic has made a change to a partner account's subscription or invoice information. The endpoint must support HTTPS. The partner-specified portion of the URL is identified from the Settings tab of New Relic's Partner Portal. The PARTNER_ID is the partner's external ID for this account. This value must be passed when the account is created by using the partner_external_identifier parameter. Billing API Supported functionality for the Partnership billing API includes: Customer subscription notification Invoice information notification Customer subscription notification API To communicate changes to a partner about a customer's subscription, New Relic uses the POST method with this URI: https://partner-specified/partner-specified/PARTNER_ID.json Copy Authentication is done via headers with the partner's REST API key or Admin user's API key. The Partnership API returns the results as JSON. Parameters: Name Type Description id String The customer's New Relic account ID subscription_id Integer Subscription's numeric ID subscription_string String Description of subscription for display price Integer Monthly price of subscription in cents number_of_hosts Integer Number of hosts starts Date Subscription's start date (yyyymmdd) expires Date Subscription's end date (yyyymmdd) Return codes: 200: Successfully updated. 404: Account not found. 422: Missing or invalid parameters. Authentication failed. Invoice notification API New Relic uses this endpoint to notify the partner of changes to a partner account's subscription level and invoice information. New Relic uses the PUT method with this URI: https://partner-specified/partner-specified/PARTNER_ID.json Copy OR https://partner-specified/partner-specified/PARTNER_ID.xml Copy The Partnership API returns the results as JSON or XML. Parameters: Name Type Description id string The customer's New Relic account ID subscription_id integer Subscription's numeric ID subscription_string string Description of subscription for display price integer Monthly price of subscription in cents Return codes: 200: Successfully updated. 404: Account not found. 422: Missing or invalid parameters.

      "body": "This doc explains how to use the Partnership API to manage child accounts. For accounts, you'd use the child account object. Requirements You may not have access to using this object. Before using the Partnership API, first read the requirements. Introduction to using child accounts Some notes about using the child account object: To manage existing parent accounts or child accounts, use the Partnership API account object. A parent account may have more than one associated child account, but every chld account must correspond to one and only one parent account. Every child account must have at least a primary_admin user. You cannot create a child account without connecting it to an existing parent account and adding at least one user. Child account object attributes Before using the Partnership API, first read the requirements. Here are the Partnership API child account object's attributes: name (REQUIRED) Type: String Default: (none) This name must be unique in New Relic's database. If the specified name is not unique, it will be auto-incremented with a numeric suffix as follows: conflicting_name_1 conflicting_name_2 etc. Copy allow_api_access Type: Boolean Default: False This flag allows API access to application data. This must be set to true for partnerships remotely administering accounts. testing Type: Boolean Default: False Use this flag to indicate a test account. Test accounts are assumed to contain garbage data and are ignored by internal systems. The data they generate may be deleted at any time. users (REQUIRED for some accounts) Type: Array Default: (none) An array defining a list of users. There are some restrictions in place dependent on the status of your account: For customer partnerships who have switched to the New Relic One user model: do not define users. If you add users with this field, they will be ignored. Instead, to add users, you'd use these user management procedures. For all other accounts, which have users on our original user model: When you create the child account, you can define only one user: the account Owner. To add additional users, use the Partnership API user object. For more about restrictions, read the Requirements. password (REQUIRED) Type: String Default: (none) If you are creating a child account with an existing user as the account Owner, the password must match the user's current password. For some New Relic organizations, child accounts can also be created via the parent account's Account settings page in the New Relic UI. Child account API calls Here is the URL pattern to create child accounts. Notice that the Parent Account ID must be specified. If using this URL pattern, send the JSON object along with an HTTP header containing the Partner API key. For example: POST .../api/v2/partners/PARTNER_ID/accounts/PARENT_ACCOUNT_ID/sub_accounts​ x-api-key:PARTNER_ACCOUNT_KEY Content-Type: application/json { JSON data } Copy Call Resource URL pattern Create a child account with the given parameters.

      "body": "New Relic's Partnership API includes functionality for partners to replace a customer's existing subscription with a new one, or to update invoice information for New Relic partner accounts. This is particularly useful for partners acting as resellers or managed service providers of New Relic accounts. For example, when customers of a New Relic reseller partner purchase a higher subscription level from New Relic's Sales team, New Relic replaces the old subscription with a new subscription. New Relic then uses the API to communicate this information to the partner. Requirements Before using this object, please read the Partnership API requirements. Communication endpoint Partners must implement a billing communication endpoint that identifies the partner's URL and PARTNER_ID. New Relic uses this endpoint to notify the partner that New Relic has made a change to a partner account's subscription or invoice information. The endpoint must support HTTPS. The partner-specified portion of the URL is identified from the Settings tab of New Relic's Partner Portal. The PARTNER_ID is the partner's external ID for this account. This value must be passed when the account is created by using the partner_external_identifier parameter. Billing API Supported functionality for the Partnership billing API includes: Customer subscription notification Invoice information notification Customer subscription notification API To communicate changes to a partner about a customer's subscription, New Relic uses the POST method with this URI: https://partner-specified/partner-specified/PARTNER_ID.json Copy Authentication is done via headers with the partner's REST API key or Admin user's API key. The Partnership API returns the results as JSON. Parameters: Name Type Description id String The customer's New Relic account ID subscription_id Integer Subscription's numeric ID subscription_string String Description of subscription for display price Integer Monthly price of subscription in cents number_of_hosts Integer Number of hosts starts Date Subscription's start date (yyyymmdd) expires Date Subscription's end date (yyyymmdd) Return codes: 200: Successfully updated. 404: Account not found. 422: Missing or invalid parameters.

      "body": "Application monitoring tips you need to know It's one thing to know how to use APM, but it's another thing to know how to use New Relic's application performance monitoring software well. Here are some best practices designed to help you become an APM pro—and a key asset to your team! Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. 1. Standardize application names Most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as \"My Application\" or \"PHP Application,\" if you don't specify one in your New Relic configuration file. You don't want to end up with 20 identically named applications, be sure to select a descriptive identifier for your apps as soon you deploy them. To keep things consistent and easy to navigate, New Relic recommends standardizing your application naming (for example, all apps in Staging append [ Staging] or the like at the end of their names). Ideally, you want your new Java applications to be named automatically to reduce the chances of typographical errors and misnaming. How to do it For Java applications, automatic application naming can come from the following sources: Request attribute Servlet init parameter Filter init parameter Web app context parameter Web app context name (display name) Web app context path Choose the method that fits best your needs and follow these steps. For non-Java applications, there are no automatic naming methods, so refer to the documentation for your APM agent. 2. Add tags to your applications When several different applications use the same account, and each application spans multiple environments (for example, development, test, pre-production, production), it can be hard to find a specific application in your overview dashboard. That's why we recommend adding tags to your apps so that you can segment them into logical groups. The two most common tags that mature APM customers use are application name and environment. So, for example, if you wanted to view the billing application in Test, you could simply filter by \"billing app\" (name tag) and \"test\" (environment tag). Caution In the APM agent configuration settings files, use the labels field to add tags to your data. For example, see this description of the Python labels setting. APM is designed so that apps can roll up into an unlimited number of meaningful tag categories. How to do it Learn about tags. Learn how to add tags. Learn how to query tags. 3. Create and evaluate alert policies When key performance indicators spike or drop, individuals and teams in your organization need to be notified. Alerting in New Relic provides a set of tools including dynamic baselines that allow you to detect problems before they impact your end users. Alert policies can be set up in two primary ways: Static threshold alerts are great when you already know the nature of an application and its normal behaviors aren't likely to change anytime soon. Apdex score, response time, error rate, throughput are some of the static thresholds you can create alert policies on. Dynamic baseline alerts make it easy to determine and set dynamic alert thresholds for applications with varying seasonal patterns and growth trends (which make it difficult to set thresholds that define normal behavior). These alerts use baselines modeled from your application’s historical metric data. Each alert policy can contain as many conditions as you need, and each alert condition includes three components: Type of condition (metric, external service, and so on) Entities that the policy targets (for example, APM apps, browser monitoring apps, or hosts) Thresholds that escalate into alerting situations with increasing severity Once you have your alerting set up, you then want to make sure you're taking advantage of all viable notification channels. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can manage alerts by creating specific user groups and by leveraging New Relic's integrated alert channels, including Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks, and email. Be sure to evaluate alert policies on a regular basis to ensure that they are always valid. How to do it See the detailed documentation: To set up dynamic baseline alerts and choose an application, follow standard procedures. You will see a preview of the metric with the predicted baseline You can select a metric for that application and see the corresponding baseline. Then, using the threshold sliders, you can set how closely you want your threshold to follow the baseline prediction. To set up static threshold alerts for your Apdex settings, follow standard procedures. To set up your alert notification channels, follow standard procedures. 4. Identify and set up key transactions Depending on the nature of your application, some transactions may be more important to you than others. New Relic's key transactions feature is designed to help you closely monitor what you consider to be your app's most business-critical transactions, whether that's end-user or app response time, call counts, error rates, or something else. You can also set alert threshold levels for notifications when your key transactions are performing poorly. How to do it In the menu bar, select More > Key transactions, and then select Add more. Then select the app and web transaction or, from the selected transaction, select Track as key transaction. Type a name for the key transaction, and select Track key transaction. Optional: If the agent for the selected app supports custom alerting, use the default values that New Relic automatically fills, or select Edit key alert transaction policy to set the Apdex and alert threshold values. To view the key transactions dashboard details, select View new key transaction. 5. Track deployment history When development teams are pushing new code out as frequently as possible, it can be hard to measure the impact that each deployment is having on performance. One way to stay in tune with how these changes are affecting your application is with deployment reports. These reports list recent deployments and their impact on end-users and app servers' Apdex scores, along with response times, throughput, and errors. You can also view and drill down into the details to catch errors related to recent deployments, or file a ticket and share details with your team. How to do it From the New Relic menu bar, select APM > (selected app) > Events > Deployments. To view performance after a deployment, go to the selected app's Overview dashboard in the Recent events section. A blue vertical bar on a chart indicates a deployment. To view summary information about the deployment, point to the blue bar. 6. Review APM reports From SLA, deployment, and capacity to scalability, host usage reports, and more, APM offers a variety of downloadable reporting tools surfacing historical trends—all great ways to report to senior executive teams or customers. Take a look at the full list of reports and use them to your advantage. How to do it From the APM menu bar, select Applications > (selected app) > Reports. Select the report you'd like to see. If you want to save or export a report to share, select Download this report as .csv, which will create a report with comma-separated values. 7. Review your environment with service maps Use New Relic service maps, a feature included in APM, to understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and talk to each other. Service maps are visual, customizable representations of your application architecture. Maps automatically show you your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. How to do it Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps. To get started, see Introduction to service maps. 8. Keep current With New Relic’s SaaS platform, getting new features is as easy as updating your agent. Most likely your organization already has a set of scripts for deploying application upgrades into your environment. In a similar fashion, you can also automate your New Relic agent deployment to ensure that your systems are up to date. Both Puppet and Chef scripts are great examples of deployment frameworks that make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. How to do it Regularly review which version of the agent you're using so that you know when an update is needed. If the latest agent release contains a needed fix or added functionality, download it. To deploy the agent automatically (preferred as a method to avoid errors): Use existing deployment scripts, provided they can be adapted to handle the deployment. OR Create and maintain a script that specifically deploys and configures the New Relic agent. Ideally, the script would pull the agent files from a repository where the files are versioned (for rollback purposes). Once the script has been created, shut down the application (unless script handles this). Run the deployment script. Start the application (unless script handles this). If problems arise, run the script to roll back to the previous version. To deploy the agent manually: Back up the current agent directory. Deploy the updated agent into the existing agent directory. Modify configuration files by comparing new files with existing files. In particular, make sure things like license key and custom extensions are copied over to the new configuration. Restart the application. If problems arise, restore the old agent using the backup and restart. 9. Manage user access How you manage your users depends on which user model your users are on: See original user management docs See New Relic One user management docs",

      "body": "With Applied Intelligence's Proactive Detection, anomalies from your APM-monitored applications are automatically surfaced in our activity streams and anomalies feed. Each anomaly can be clicked on to bring up an automatic analysis. You can have notifications for anomalies delivered in Slack, or you can set up a webhook to deliver messages when you need them. These events are available for querying, creating custom dashboards, and alerting. By creating a Proactive Detection configuration (a group of apps you’re interested in), you can then add this configuration as a source, and have anomalies automatically correlated with other data sources via Incident Intelligence. Requirements To use Proactive Detection, ensure you have: An APM agent installed for at least one applications. To receive notifications in Slack, you'll need to ask your IT administrator to install the New Relic application in your Slack workspace. For more on data limits, see Data limits. Why it matters With Proactive Detection, Applied Intelligence delivers insights about anomalies in your production system, along with an automatic analysis of the anomaly. It’s enabled automatically, at no additional cost. When an anomaly is detected, you can view it in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed, or we'll send notifications directly to your Slack channel or a webhook. How it works Proactive Detection uses the following methods to detect anomalies in your app data: Proactive Detection monitors metric data reported by an APM agent, building a model of your typical application dynamics, and focuses on key golden signals: throughput, response time, and errors. If one of these golden signals shows anomalous behavior, the system flags it and tracks recovery to normal behavior. The system adapts to changes in your data, and continuously updates models based on new data. Automatically on: By default, Proactive Detection monitors all your APM applications, with no action required by you. When an anomaly is detected, it's automatically surfaced in various activity streams, the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed and is available for querying via NRQL. Receiving notifications: We send notifications when we detect anomalous changes in throughput, error rate, or response time. The notifications are sent to selected Slack channels, or sent via webhook. When the anomaly goes back to normal, a recovery message is sent. If you don't want to receive notifications, you still have access to the data via NRQL query. Anomaly analysis: For each anomaly, we provide a link in Slack to an analyze anomaly page. This page generates automatic insights into the anomaly. The page is also available from the anomalies tab, which lists recent anomalies. This page uses your existing APM and Proactive Detection data to provide explanations as to the cause of the anomaly. Activity stream: Inside various activity streams such as the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary page, Lookout and Explorer, you'll see relevant anomalies from your APM-monitored applications. Clicking on any of the anomaly events in the activity stream brings up the analysis page for that anomaly. Applications will not always generate anomalies, so it can be normal to not receive any detections. Set up notifications for Proactive Detection Proactive Detection is enabled automatically, at no additional cost. To receive notifications or to have a configuration (group of apps) that you can add as a source for Incident Intelligence, you will need to create a Proactive Detection configuration. You can create a configuration in the Proactive Detection UI: From one.newrelic.com, click Alerts & AI. Under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Click Add a configuration. Input the following information into the form: Choose a name for your configuration that helps you easily identify it from others in your account. Select an account. Select up to 1,000 applications. Note that certain applications with low throughput might not be good candidates for Proactive Detection, as they can be more sensitive to smaller amounts of data fluctuation. Optional: select the golden signals you'd like to monitor for anomalies. Optional: connect to Incident Intelligence. Set up for Slack To use Proactive Detection with Slack: Select Slack. Choose which Slack channel receives notifications. You can select any existing public or private channel. This prompts the workflow to add the Applied Intelligence Slack application to your selected channel. To create a new channel, do that directly in Slack first. Tip If you experience an error when assigning Slack channels, make sure that the New Relic AI Slack application has been added to your Slack workspace. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up for webhooks To use Proactive Detection with webhooks: Select Webhook. Input the following information into the form: Provide the webhook URL. Provide optional custom headers. Choose to edit the custom payload, or enable using the default payload. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Set up without notifications To use Proactive Detection when you don't need to receive notifications: Select No notifications. Save the configuration. You can modify the applications for each configuration at any time by selecting the configuration in the configuration table. Mute notifications (Slack only) In Slack, detections coming from specific applications can be muted temporarily or permanently. The entire channel can also be muted temporarily. This is useful in the case of an incident or when the channel should otherwise not be interrupted. To mute in Slack, select Mute this app’s warnings or Mute all warnings, then select the duration. We will resume sending notifications for any detections once the muting duration has completed. Muting an application permanently removes it from the configuration. To add it back in, go to one.newrelic.com, in the top nav click Alerts & AI, then click Proactive Detection, and select the configuration to edit. Muting Proactive Detection notifications does not affect alerts. Use Proactive Detection Slack messages Each anomaly message has several key pieces of information you can use to learn more about and start troubleshooting the potential issue: The application name and a link to more information about it in New Relic One. The metric experiencing an anomaly and a link to its details in New Relic One. A graph of the metric over time to provide a visual understanding of the anomaly’s behavior and degree. An Analyze button that navigates to an analysis page in Applied Intelligence that identifies key attributes that are unique to the anomaly, anomalies found upstream or downstream, and any other relevant signals. Once an anomaly has returned to normal, we send a recovery notification with the option to provide feedback. Your feedback provides our development team with input to help us improve detection quality. In the case of feedback provided on throughput anomalies, an evaluation is run each hour based on feedback to fit a more suitable model. If we helped you, you can select Yes or No. View overview of anomalies In addition to notifications for anomalies that give you information via Slack or webhook, you can view more information about the anomalies in your environment via the Anomalies tab on the Alerts & AI Overview page. That tab provides a list of all the recent anomalies from every configuration in the selected account, and you can select an anomaly for a detailed analysis. Anomaly visibility settings Anomalies are displayed in various New Relic activity streams and in the Applied Intelligence anomalies feed. You can customize what is displayed using the anomaly visibility settings (for example, hiding throughput anomalies on an activity stream but keeping them in the anomalies feed). To find these settings: from Alerts & AI, under Proactive Detection, click Settings. Notes on using these settings: These settings are applied at the user level. Changes you make won’t affect others users in your organization. Regardless of these settings, the anomalies are still reported and available for NRQL querying. Details on these UI sections: AI overview and anomalies tab: Use the AI overview and anomalies tab setting to hide anomalies from the AI overview and anomalies tab setting. Please note you also can use filters specific to these views as well. Global activity stream: Use the global activity stream section to customize what anomalies are shown in the various New Relic activity streams, including the New Relic One homepage, APM Summary, and Lookout. Anomaly types: Use the check boxes here to hide specific types of anomalies. For example uncheck Web throughput and Non-web throughput anomalies to hide these types of anomalies from both the activity streams and the AI overview and anomalies tab. (Note they are still reported and available for querying.) Query anomaly data You can use NRQL to query and chart your Proactive Detection data using the NrAiAnomaly event. For example: FROM NrAiAnomaly SELECT * Important This data has previously been attached to the ProactiveDetection event. That event will be deprecated on April 7, 2021. If you use ProactiveDetection in your custom charts, you should convert those queries to using NrAiAnomaly. Here are important attributes attached to this event: Attribute Description closeTime timestamp The time when the anomaly ended. Example: 1615304100000. configurationType string The type of configuration monitoring the event. If at least one configuration is monitoring the entity, this is set to configuration. Otherwise, it's set to automatic. entity.accountId number The New Relic account ID to which the entity belongs. entity.domain number The domain of the entity (currently only APM but will change with future functionality). entity.guid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entityGuid. entityGuid string The GUID of the entity. This is used to identify and retrieve data about the entity via NerdGraph. Identical to entity.guid. entity.name string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entityName. Example: Laura's coffee service. entityName string The name of the entity whose data was determined to be anomalous. Identical to entity.name. entity.type string The type of entity (currently only APPLICATION but will change with future functionality). evaluationType string This is always anomaly. event string Indicates whether it's the beginning (open) or end (close) of the anomalous data. openTime timestamp The time when the anomaly opened. Example: 1615303740000. signalType string The type of data that was analyzed. For example, error_rate or response_time.non_web. timestamp timestamp The time at which the event was written. title string Description of the anomaly. Example: Error rate was much higher than normal. Add anomalies as source in Incident Intelligence By integrating Incident Intelligence with your Proactive Detection anomalies, you can get context and correlations. To learn about doing this in Incident Intelligence, see Configure sources. You can also select Connect to Incident Intelligence from inside of a configuration. Webhook payload and examples Proactive Detection sends the event body in JSON format via HTTPS POST. The system expects the endpoint to return a successful HTTP code (2xx). If you use webhooks to configure Proactive Detection, use these examples of the webhook body format and JSON schema. Attribute Description category enum The category of data that was analyzed. Categories include web throughput, non-web throughput, web transactions, non-web transactions, and error class. data list The time series data leading up to the detection. data[].timestamp number The timestamp of the data point in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. Example: 1584366819000 data[].unit string The unit describing the value of the data point. Data units include count, milliseconds, and error_rate. data[].value number The value of the data point. Example: 1.52 detectionType enum The type of data that was analyzed.

      "body": "Want even longer periods of uninterrupted sleep? Here are eight best practices to make dynamic infrastructure and server monitoring even easier with New Relic's infrastructure monitoring. 1. Install the infrastructure agent across your entire environment Our infrastructure monitoring solution was designed to help enterprise customers monitor their large and dynamically changing environments at scale. In order to facilitate this, the UI is completely driven by tags that let you visualize aggregated metrics, events, and inventory for a large number of servers. To really get the most out of infrastructure monitoring, we recommend installing it across your entire environment, preferably even across multiple regions and clusters. This will provide a more accurate picture of the health of your host ecosystem and the impact your infrastructure has on your applications. Want to achieve faster Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR)? Install the infrastructure agent on database servers, web servers, and any other host that supports your applications. When deploying the agent, leverage custom attributes to tag your hosts so that you can use those for filtering the data presented in the UI and for setting alerts. This is in addition to any Amazon EC2 tags you may be using which will auto-import when you enable the EC2 integration. You may also prefer to keep the agent logs separate from the system logs, which you can do through the configuration. How to do it Leverage our install modules for config management tools such as Chef, Puppet and Ansible to easily deploy your agent across all your infrastructure. Read the instructions in the github repo for your config management tool referenced in the link above and define the custom_attributes you want to use to tag your hosts. Set the log_file attribute to your preferred location for the infrastructure agent logs. Tip If you are installing the agent on a single host, the process should only take a few minutes and you can find detailed instructions in our documentation. 2. Configure the native EC2 integration If you have an AWS environment, in addition to installing the infrastructure agent on your EC2 instances to monitor them, we also recommend configuring the EC2 integration so that New Relic can automatically import all the tags and metadata associated with your AWS instances. This allows you to filter down to a part of your infrastructure using the same AWS tags (example, ECTag_Role='Kafka'), and slice-and-dice your data in multiple ways. Additionally, our ‘Alerts’ and ‘Saved Filter Sets’ are completely tag-driven and dynamic, so they automatically add/remove instances matching these tags to give our users the most real-time views that scale with your cloud infrastructure. 3. Activate the integrations Monitoring your infrastructure extends beyond just CPU, memory, and storage utilization. That’s why New Relic has out-of-the-box integrations that allow you to monitor all the services that support your hosts as well. Activate any of our integrations, including AWS Billing, AWS ELB, Amazon S3, MySQL, NGINX, and more, to extend monitoring to your AWS or on-host applications, and access the pre-configured dashboards that appear for each of them. 4. Create filter sets With New Relic, users can create filter sets to organize hosts, cluster roles, and other resources based on criteria that matter the most to users. This allows you to optimize your resources by using a focused view to monitor, detect, and resolve any problems proactively. The attributes for filtering are populated from the auto-imported EC2 tags or custom tags that may be applied to hosts. You can combine as many filters as you want in a filter set, and save them to share with other people in your account. You’ll also be able to see the color-coded health status of each host inside the filter set, so you can quickly identify problematic areas of your infrastructure. Additionally, filter sets can be used in the health map to get an overview of your infrastructure performance at a glance based on the filters that matter to your teams. 5. Create alert conditions With New Relic, you can create alert conditions directly within the context of what you are currently monitoring with New Relic. For example, if you are viewing a filter set comprised of a large number of hosts and notice a problem, you don’t need to create an individual alert condition for every host within. Instead, we recommend initiating the alert condition directly from the chart of the metric you are viewing and creating it based on the filter tags. This will create an alert condition for any hosts that match those tags, allowing our infrastructure monitoring to automatically remove hosts that go offline and add new hosts to the alert condition if they match those tags. Alerts configured once for the appropriate tags will scale correctly across all future hosts. And know that you can also leverage existing alert policies for infrastructure alert conditions. 6. View infrastructure data alongside APM data The integration between APM and infrastructure monitoring lets you see your APM data and infrastructure data side by side, so you can find the root cause of problems more quickly, no matter where they originate. This allows users to view the performance relationship of your hosts and the applications running on them, allowing for quicker diagnosis of the issue and impact on the business’ health. Use health maps to quickly spot any issues or alerts related to the health of your applications and how that connects to the supporting infrastructure. The first boxes starting from the top left are those that require your attention. 7. Access Infrastructure data using the Data explorer Teams that use multiple New Relic capabilities find it useful to create a single dashboard to visually correlate the infrastructure’s health with application, browser and synthetics metrics. That’s where New Relic data exploration features comes in. All the granular metrics and events collected by infrastructure monitoring are stored in New Relic and are accessible to you immediately. Having access to the raw metrics means you can run more custom queries using NRQL, and also create dashboards to share infrastructure metrics with your team. 8. Update your agents regularly New Relic’s software engineering team is constantly pushing out improvements and new features to improve our customers’ overall monitoring experience. In order to take advantage of all the awesomeness they’re delivering, we recommend regularly updating to the latest version of the infrastructure agent. Want more user tips?

      "body": "Improve your Alerts coverage by implementing the following recommendations and get the most out of your alerts configuration. Read on to learn the best practices for: Policies Notification channels Incident preferences Thresholds and violations Muting rules Recommended alerts Use recommended alerts conditions conditions if you are new to Alerts or if you want suggestions that optimize your alert coverage. Organize your policies A policy is a container for similar conditions. If you’re new to Alerts, learn how to create, edit, or find policies. Organize your policy's scope to a single entity when possible. Assign your policy to the essential team or teams that need to be notified when an incident occurs. This way, you keep policies centralized and focused. If a team is monitoring several groups of the same entity type, combine those entity clusters (like servers) together into one policy. This way, your team can be notified from one policy rather than navigating several policies at once. You can use Alerts to monitor all of your entities. Consider your role and priorities when assigning yourself to a policy. For example: Software developers may need notifications for both front-end and back-end performance, such as webpage response time and page load JavaScript errors. Operations personnel may need notifications for poor back-end performance, such as server memory and load averages. The product owner may need notifications for positive front-end performance, such as improved end user Apdex scores or sales being monitored in dashboards. Set your condition thresholds and violations Set meaningful threshold levels to optimize Alerts for your business. Here are some suggested guidelines: Action Recommendations Set threshold levels Avoid setting thresholds too low. For example, if you set a CPU condition threshold of 75% for 5 minutes on your production servers, and it routinely goes over that level, this will increase the likelihood of un-actionable alerts or false positives. Experimenting with settings You do not need to edit files or restart software, so feel free to make quick changes to your threshold levels and adjust as necessary. Adjust settings Adjust your conditions over time. As you use our products to help you optimize your entity's performance, tighten your thresholds to keep pace with your improved performance. If you are rolling out something that you know will negatively impact your performance for a period of time, loosen your thresholds to allow for this. Disable settings You can disable any condition in a policy. This is useful, for example, if you want to continue using other conditions in the policy while you experiment with other metrics or thresholds. In most of our products (except Infrastructure), the color-coded health status indicator in the user interface changes as the alerting threshold escalates or returns to normal. This allows you to monitor a situation through our UI before a critical threshold passes, without needing to receive specific notifications about it. There are two violation thresholds: critical (red) and warning (yellow). Define these thresholds with different criteria, keeping in mind the suggestions above. Important Warning violations do not open incidents. A critical violation can open incidents, but you must define that decision through your incident preferences. Decide what happens when there's no signal Loss of signal occurs when New Relic stops receiving data for a while; technically, we detect loss of signal after a significant amount of time has elapsed since data was last received in a time series. Loss of signal can be used to trigger or resolve a violation, which you can use to set up alerts. You can configure loss of signal settings by condition in the UI or configure loss of signal via the NerdGraph API. Use non-null values when there's no signal By default, gaps in data signals are filled with null values. In cases where you need to be able to create conditions based on those data gaps, you can fill gaps with a custom value or the last known value. You can configure this setting by condition in the UI or configure gap filling values via NerdGraph Define your incident preferences Decide when you get incident notifications so you can respond to incidents when they happen. If you’re new to Alerts, learn more about your incident preferences options. The default incident preference setting combines all conditions within a policy into one incident. Change your default incident preference setting to increase or decrease the number of incidents and incident notifications you receive. Each team within your organization will have different needs. Ask your team two important questions when deciding your incident preferences: Do we want to be notified every time something goes wrong? Do we want to group all similar notifications together and be notified once? When a policy and its conditions have a broader scope (like managing the performance of several entities), increase the amount of incidents you receive. You will need more notifications because two incidents will not necessarily relate to each other. When a policy and its conditions have a focused scope (like managing the performance of one entity), opt for the default incident preference. You will need less notifications when two incidents are related to each other or when the team is already notified and fixing an existing problem. Decide how you get incident notifications by using our notification channel best practices. Select your notification channels Tailor notifications to the most useful channel and policy so you can avoid alert fatigue and help the right personnel receive and respond to incidents they care about in a systematic way. If you’re new to Alerts, learn how to set up notification channels. Notify teams and individuals who needs to stay updated on or resolve a problem when an incident arises. To stay updated, select a notification channel that is less intrusive, like email. For vital notifications and incident responses, select a notification channel that is more intrusive, like PagerDuty or Slack. Do not rely on email for quick notifications in case of delays. Understand muting rules Mute alerts during routine events, such as maintenance or planned downtime. You can also silence a policy, a specific entity, and a condition when needed. Incidents can still be opened, but you won't be notified. If you're new to Alerts, learn how to create and manage muting rules. What's next? To learn more about using alerts: Learn about the API.

      "body": "By eliminating crashes and increasing speed across the stack, you can build better performance into every mobile app release. Here are some best practices to take full advantage of mobile monitoring with New Relic. 1. Start collecting data Start collecting data in production. You'll see immediate value by adding our mobile monitoring SDK to your app for its next release to the app store. We recommend installing the iOS or Android agent to your production release even if you're simply testing New Relic's capabilities. This will ensure you'll get an adequate amount of data to really understand all of our mobile monitoring capabilities and your end users' experience. How to do it Add your mobile app to New Relic First, add a new app in New Relic's user interface (full steps): Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. From the list of monitored apps, select Add more. Select the relevant platform. Type a name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Use one app and the associated app token for the development releases of your iOS app, another app and its associated app token for the production releases of that iOS app, and another pair of app tokens for development and production releases of your Android app. You'll be able to compare data from across the four app tokens using our query builder. Install and configure our mobile SDK Next, install and configure the mobile agent: Download the latest version of New Relic's SDK for iOS or Android, and add it to your mobile app. (Full steps for iOS and Android) Configure your installation as needed. For example: Enable the feature flag to capture MobileRequest events to use our full network analysis capabilities for iOS or Android. Automate dSYM uploads for your production builds. To avoid surprises, follow the standard pattern of where you start our mobile agent. In addition, start our agent before you initiate any other SDKs. For more information, see our documentation for Android installation and configuration and for iOS installation and configuration. Deploy a new release of your application. 2. Explore your data Immediately be able to explore your data. As soon as New Relic starts reporting data, take the time to explore the wealth of information about your mobile apps. To get started, go to one.newrelic.com and select Mobile. How to do it Analyze, resolve, and prevent crashes Find the cause of crashes so you can fix them. Then, uncover trends behind crashes so you can prevent them: From the summary UI page for a monitored mobile app, click Crash analysis. Analyze crash data so you can see and fix the most impactful crashes. Follow the breadcrumbs in the crash event trail to fix crashes and resolve critical errors more easily: From your mobile app's Crash analysis page in the UI, select a Crash type. From the crash type's Summary page, select the Crash trail tab. Monitor your key workflows Create custom breadcrumbs to monitor key workflows (such as your app's login or checkout process), track user clicks, optimize timing, and identify crash locations for faster MTTR. Get actionable session data Borrow from our example queries to: See how much of your user base has upgraded to your latest app version. Track adoption over time. Get a count of new installs as compared to upgrades from an earlier version. See the distribution of usage across geographical locations, carriers, ASN owners (wi-fi providers), devices, connection types, and more. 3. Take preventive steps Use alert notifications to help uncover the causes behind crashes and errors. Once you are running our mobile monitoring capabilities in production and have explored some of the key features, you can use New Relic to uncover critical issues with your mobile application. In particular, focus on crashes and errors. Use metric-based alerts as a starting point to gain high-level visibility into problems. Then, as new services or functionalities are added, use New Relic’s more targeted, event-based (NRQL) alerts to make sure that the most critical issues are handled swiftly. Use these alerts to determine whether a crash is impacting a large number of users. If it is, the relevant people (for example, both the mobile app team’s on-call member and the owner of the related back-end service) will be alerted. Make sure that your team knows how to respond to changes in crash rate (crashes per sessions) and the percentage of users impacted by crashes of your mobile app. How to do it Metric-based alerts Use our metric-based alerts and mobile monitoring UI: Ensure that key members of your mobile team have opted in to receive emails for new crashes. These emails will take you to the crash type in the UI page for your mobile app. Create an alert for your crash rate threshold that key members of your team can view in Slack or any other Alerts notification channel you choose. Your alert notification will include a link to our UI, where you can examine a chart with the exceeded threshold. From there, a link will take you to the relevant mobile monitoring page, where you can get additional details. Event-based alerts Combine the metric-based workflow with event-based alerts and dashboards specific to your mobile app and system. Create your NRQL alert that focuses on crashes of your most recently released production version. Create an additional NRQL alert that focuses on the percentage of users impacted by crashes in your latest app version (to check the overall impact on your user base). 4. Dig deeper into crashes Take your crash reporting to the next level. Now it’s time to tackle some of those harder-to-reproduce crashes by: Applying additional instrumentation to your application. Leveraging crash event trails, NRQL queries, and dashboards to visualize your data. How to do it Crash analysis Crashes are an inevitable part of running mobile applications at scale. We provide tools to help you understand your highest-impact crashes. Use the Crash analysis UI to see which crashes are occurring most often, the percentage of crash-free users, which files and methods are associated with perhaps 80 percent of your crashes, which crashes a particular user just experienced, and more. Go after high-impact crashes with crash analysis: Add custom attributes to categorize the highest-value customers, and then use them to segment crashes according to your most valuable audiences. Add breadcrumbs and custom events to produce a detailed trail of events leading up to every crash occurrence (over the last 90 days). Then, view this crash event trail in our mobile monitoring UI. Use our mobile monitoring's Versions trends page to make sure you’re improving the crash rate over subsequent releases and avoiding regressions. Breadcrumbs Use breadcrumbs and custom attributes to better reproduce and debug crashes. For example, use our recordBreadrumb API for Android or iOS to track mid-session changes in state that can help debug crashes, such as: Change of connection type Change of orientation CPU and memory state at key points in the app code Custom attributes Add custom attributes to existing events, so you can ask even more precise questions of your mobile app. Add dimensions such as: User ID: Use to react to specific user concerns and to better understand which customers and segments are most impacted. Store ID: Use to address problems with out-of-date devices, bad wi-fi, and so on. User segments: Use to better understand which customers and segments are most impacted; for example, logged in vs. non-logged in. Money in the cart at session end Origin or attribution of entry into the app Standardize custom attribute names across your mobile apps, and align with your website (if you're using our browser monitoring), so that you can compare and contrast performance across end-user channels. The mobile agents track the last interaction of crashed and non-crashed sessions to provide visibility into what the user viewed before exiting your app (either intentionally or due to a crash). 5. Focus on KPIs Bring your key performance indicators to life. Create custom interactions and events to hone in on the most important signals, including user activity for the business-critical aspects of your app. Using these powerful APIs, you can add custom instrumentation to just about anything. The following are some example use cases. How to do it Track and query feature use Use custom events to track feature use. For example: Use custom events to track user flow between app and website. Use custom events or mobile breadcrumbs to optimize the performance of key user flows (log in, shopping cart, etc.). use custom events to provide faster, contextualized support experiences for your digital customers. Use the recordCustomEvent API. Then compare the use of different features using: SELECT count(*) FROM MyNewMobileEventType FACET name Copy Measure page load times Use custom events to measure page load time: Create an app-launch timer to measure the time that elapses between a user-tap to launch your app and the point in your app code where the first screen is available. Record the timer value in New Relic using something like the following: recordCustomEvent(<myMobileTimers>, <appLaunch>, {attributes}) Copy Define start and stop timers to measure spinner durations, and then record this time in New Relic using something like the following: recordCustomEvent(<myMobileTimers>, <spinnerOnScreenA>, {attributes}) Copy Track specific user actions or funnel steps in the app (like \"add to cart\"), and include the price as an attribute on that event. Measure flows through the application by viewing the related funnel steps with custom events in Insights. For example, create a timer to track the start and end times of a subflow or an entire flow across multiple funnel steps to understand how long it took users to get through the process. Examine data about webpage interactions Use custom interactions to see traces associated with the same webpages. Use the agent API to disable default interactions, and focus on custom interactions so that you can review the page loads that are most crucial to your primary funnel. Define the start and stop times of these custom interactions to trace activities associated with individual steps of that funnel (for example, a specific user action or a page load). Track the last interactions of crashed and non-crashed sessions so that you can see what the user viewed before exiting your app (either intentionally or from a crash). Example query for non-crashed sessions: SELECT count(*) FROM Mobile WHERE sessionCrashed is null FACET lastInteraction SINCE 90 days ago Copy Example query for crashed sessions: SELECT count(*) FROM Mobile WHERE sessionCrashed is true FACET lastInteraction SINCE 90 days ago Copy",

      "body": "Application monitoring tips you need to know It's one thing to know how to use APM, but it's another thing to know how to use New Relic's application performance monitoring software well. Here are some best practices designed to help you become an APM pro—and a key asset to your team! Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. 1. Standardize application names Most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as \"My Application\" or \"PHP Application,\" if you don't specify one in your New Relic configuration file. You don't want to end up with 20 identically named applications, be sure to select a descriptive identifier for your apps as soon you deploy them. To keep things consistent and easy to navigate, New Relic recommends standardizing your application naming (for example, all apps in Staging append [ Staging] or the like at the end of their names). Ideally, you want your new Java applications to be named automatically to reduce the chances of typographical errors and misnaming. How to do it For Java applications, automatic application naming can come from the following sources: Request attribute Servlet init parameter Filter init parameter Web app context parameter Web app context name (display name) Web app context path Choose the method that fits best your needs and follow these steps. For non-Java applications, there are no automatic naming methods, so refer to the documentation for your APM agent. 2. Add tags to your applications When several different applications use the same account, and each application spans multiple environments (for example, development, test, pre-production, production), it can be hard to find a specific application in your overview dashboard. That's why we recommend adding tags to your apps so that you can segment them into logical groups. The two most common tags that mature APM customers use are application name and environment. So, for example, if you wanted to view the billing application in Test, you could simply filter by \"billing app\" (name tag) and \"test\" (environment tag). Caution In the APM agent configuration settings files, use the labels field to add tags to your data. For example, see this description of the Python labels setting. APM is designed so that apps can roll up into an unlimited number of meaningful tag categories. How to do it Learn about tags. Learn how to add tags. Learn how to query tags. 3. Create and evaluate alert policies When key performance indicators spike or drop, individuals and teams in your organization need to be notified. Alerting in New Relic provides a set of tools including dynamic baselines that allow you to detect problems before they impact your end users. Alert policies can be set up in two primary ways: Static threshold alerts are great when you already know the nature of an application and its normal behaviors aren't likely to change anytime soon. Apdex score, response time, error rate, throughput are some of the static thresholds you can create alert policies on. Dynamic baseline alerts make it easy to determine and set dynamic alert thresholds for applications with varying seasonal patterns and growth trends (which make it difficult to set thresholds that define normal behavior). These alerts use baselines modeled from your application’s historical metric data. Each alert policy can contain as many conditions as you need, and each alert condition includes three components: Type of condition (metric, external service, and so on) Entities that the policy targets (for example, APM apps, browser monitoring apps, or hosts) Thresholds that escalate into alerting situations with increasing severity Once you have your alerting set up, you then want to make sure you're taking advantage of all viable notification channels. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can manage alerts by creating specific user groups and by leveraging New Relic's integrated alert channels, including Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks, and email. Be sure to evaluate alert policies on a regular basis to ensure that they are always valid. How to do it See the detailed documentation: To set up dynamic baseline alerts and choose an application, follow standard procedures. You will see a preview of the metric with the predicted baseline You can select a metric for that application and see the corresponding baseline. Then, using the threshold sliders, you can set how closely you want your threshold to follow the baseline prediction. To set up static threshold alerts for your Apdex settings, follow standard procedures. To set up your alert notification channels, follow standard procedures. 4. Identify and set up key transactions Depending on the nature of your application, some transactions may be more important to you than others. New Relic's key transactions feature is designed to help you closely monitor what you consider to be your app's most business-critical transactions, whether that's end-user or app response time, call counts, error rates, or something else. You can also set alert threshold levels for notifications when your key transactions are performing poorly. How to do it In the menu bar, select More > Key transactions, and then select Add more. Then select the app and web transaction or, from the selected transaction, select Track as key transaction. Type a name for the key transaction, and select Track key transaction. Optional: If the agent for the selected app supports custom alerting, use the default values that New Relic automatically fills, or select Edit key alert transaction policy to set the Apdex and alert threshold values. To view the key transactions dashboard details, select View new key transaction. 5. Track deployment history When development teams are pushing new code out as frequently as possible, it can be hard to measure the impact that each deployment is having on performance. One way to stay in tune with how these changes are affecting your application is with deployment reports. These reports list recent deployments and their impact on end-users and app servers' Apdex scores, along with response times, throughput, and errors. You can also view and drill down into the details to catch errors related to recent deployments, or file a ticket and share details with your team. How to do it From the New Relic menu bar, select APM > (selected app) > Events > Deployments. To view performance after a deployment, go to the selected app's Overview dashboard in the Recent events section. A blue vertical bar on a chart indicates a deployment. To view summary information about the deployment, point to the blue bar. 6. Review APM reports From SLA, deployment, and capacity to scalability, host usage reports, and more, APM offers a variety of downloadable reporting tools surfacing historical trends—all great ways to report to senior executive teams or customers. Take a look at the full list of reports and use them to your advantage. How to do it From the APM menu bar, select Applications > (selected app) > Reports. Select the report you'd like to see. If you want to save or export a report to share, select Download this report as .csv, which will create a report with comma-separated values. 7. Review your environment with service maps Use New Relic service maps, a feature included in APM, to understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and talk to each other. Service maps are visual, customizable representations of your application architecture. Maps automatically show you your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. How to do it Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps. To get started, see Introduction to service maps. 8. Keep current With New Relic’s SaaS platform, getting new features is as easy as updating your agent. Most likely your organization already has a set of scripts for deploying application upgrades into your environment. In a similar fashion, you can also automate your New Relic agent deployment to ensure that your systems are up to date. Both Puppet and Chef scripts are great examples of deployment frameworks that make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. How to do it Regularly review which version of the agent you're using so that you know when an update is needed. If the latest agent release contains a needed fix or added functionality, download it. To deploy the agent automatically (preferred as a method to avoid errors): Use existing deployment scripts, provided they can be adapted to handle the deployment. OR Create and maintain a script that specifically deploys and configures the New Relic agent. Ideally, the script would pull the agent files from a repository where the files are versioned (for rollback purposes). Once the script has been created, shut down the application (unless script handles this). Run the deployment script. Start the application (unless script handles this). If problems arise, run the script to roll back to the previous version. To deploy the agent manually: Back up the current agent directory. Deploy the updated agent into the existing agent directory. Modify configuration files by comparing new files with existing files. In particular, make sure things like license key and custom extensions are copied over to the new configuration. Restart the application. If problems arise, restore the old agent using the backup and restart. 9.

      "body": "Want even longer periods of uninterrupted sleep? Here are eight best practices to make dynamic infrastructure and server monitoring even easier with New Relic's infrastructure monitoring. 1. Install the infrastructure agent across your entire environment Our infrastructure monitoring solution was designed to help enterprise customers monitor their large and dynamically changing environments at scale. In order to facilitate this, the UI is completely driven by tags that let you visualize aggregated metrics, events, and inventory for a large number of servers. To really get the most out of infrastructure monitoring, we recommend installing it across your entire environment, preferably even across multiple regions and clusters. This will provide a more accurate picture of the health of your host ecosystem and the impact your infrastructure has on your applications. Want to achieve faster Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR)? Install the infrastructure agent on database servers, web servers, and any other host that supports your applications. When deploying the agent, leverage custom attributes to tag your hosts so that you can use those for filtering the data presented in the UI and for setting alerts. This is in addition to any Amazon EC2 tags you may be using which will auto-import when you enable the EC2 integration. You may also prefer to keep the agent logs separate from the system logs, which you can do through the configuration. How to do it Leverage our install modules for config management tools such as Chef, Puppet and Ansible to easily deploy your agent across all your infrastructure. Read the instructions in the github repo for your config management tool referenced in the link above and define the custom_attributes you want to use to tag your hosts. Set the log_file attribute to your preferred location for the infrastructure agent logs. Tip If you are installing the agent on a single host, the process should only take a few minutes and you can find detailed instructions in our documentation. 2. Configure the native EC2 integration If you have an AWS environment, in addition to installing the infrastructure agent on your EC2 instances to monitor them, we also recommend configuring the EC2 integration so that New Relic can automatically import all the tags and metadata associated with your AWS instances. This allows you to filter down to a part of your infrastructure using the same AWS tags (example, ECTag_Role='Kafka'), and slice-and-dice your data in multiple ways. Additionally, our ‘Alerts’ and ‘Saved Filter Sets’ are completely tag-driven and dynamic, so they automatically add/remove instances matching these tags to give our users the most real-time views that scale with your cloud infrastructure. 3. Activate the integrations Monitoring your infrastructure extends beyond just CPU, memory, and storage utilization. That’s why New Relic has out-of-the-box integrations that allow you to monitor all the services that support your hosts as well. Activate any of our integrations, including AWS Billing, AWS ELB, Amazon S3, MySQL, NGINX, and more, to extend monitoring to your AWS or on-host applications, and access the pre-configured dashboards that appear for each of them. 4. Create filter sets With New Relic, users can create filter sets to organize hosts, cluster roles, and other resources based on criteria that matter the most to users. This allows you to optimize your resources by using a focused view to monitor, detect, and resolve any problems proactively. The attributes for filtering are populated from the auto-imported EC2 tags or custom tags that may be applied to hosts. You can combine as many filters as you want in a filter set, and save them to share with other people in your account. You’ll also be able to see the color-coded health status of each host inside the filter set, so you can quickly identify problematic areas of your infrastructure. Additionally, filter sets can be used in the health map to get an overview of your infrastructure performance at a glance based on the filters that matter to your teams. 5. Create alert conditions With New Relic, you can create alert conditions directly within the context of what you are currently monitoring with New Relic. For example, if you are viewing a filter set comprised of a large number of hosts and notice a problem, you don’t need to create an individual alert condition for every host within. Instead, we recommend initiating the alert condition directly from the chart of the metric you are viewing and creating it based on the filter tags. This will create an alert condition for any hosts that match those tags, allowing our infrastructure monitoring to automatically remove hosts that go offline and add new hosts to the alert condition if they match those tags. Alerts configured once for the appropriate tags will scale correctly across all future hosts. And know that you can also leverage existing alert policies for infrastructure alert conditions. 6. View infrastructure data alongside APM data The integration between APM and infrastructure monitoring lets you see your APM data and infrastructure data side by side, so you can find the root cause of problems more quickly, no matter where they originate. This allows users to view the performance relationship of your hosts and the applications running on them, allowing for quicker diagnosis of the issue and impact on the business’ health. Use health maps to quickly spot any issues or alerts related to the health of your applications and how that connects to the supporting infrastructure. The first boxes starting from the top left are those that require your attention. 7. Access Infrastructure data using the Data explorer Teams that use multiple New Relic capabilities find it useful to create a single dashboard to visually correlate the infrastructure’s health with application, browser and synthetics metrics. That’s where New Relic data exploration features comes in. All the granular metrics and events collected by infrastructure monitoring are stored in New Relic and are accessible to you immediately. Having access to the raw metrics means you can run more custom queries using NRQL, and also create dashboards to share infrastructure metrics with your team. 8. Update your agents regularly New Relic’s software engineering team is constantly pushing out improvements and new features to improve our customers’ overall monitoring experience. In order to take advantage of all the awesomeness they’re delivering, we recommend regularly updating to the latest version of the infrastructure agent. Want more user tips?

      "body": "Improve your Alerts coverage by implementing the following recommendations and get the most out of your alerts configuration. Read on to learn the best practices for: Policies Notification channels Incident preferences Thresholds and violations Muting rules Recommended alerts Use recommended alerts conditions conditions if you are new to Alerts or if you want suggestions that optimize your alert coverage. Organize your policies A policy is a container for similar conditions. If you’re new to Alerts, learn how to create, edit, or find policies. Organize your policy's scope to a single entity when possible. Assign your policy to the essential team or teams that need to be notified when an incident occurs. This way, you keep policies centralized and focused. If a team is monitoring several groups of the same entity type, combine those entity clusters (like servers) together into one policy. This way, your team can be notified from one policy rather than navigating several policies at once. You can use Alerts to monitor all of your entities. Consider your role and priorities when assigning yourself to a policy. For example: Software developers may need notifications for both front-end and back-end performance, such as webpage response time and page load JavaScript errors. Operations personnel may need notifications for poor back-end performance, such as server memory and load averages. The product owner may need notifications for positive front-end performance, such as improved end user Apdex scores or sales being monitored in dashboards. Set your condition thresholds and violations Set meaningful threshold levels to optimize Alerts for your business. Here are some suggested guidelines: Action Recommendations Set threshold levels Avoid setting thresholds too low. For example, if you set a CPU condition threshold of 75% for 5 minutes on your production servers, and it routinely goes over that level, this will increase the likelihood of un-actionable alerts or false positives. Experimenting with settings You do not need to edit files or restart software, so feel free to make quick changes to your threshold levels and adjust as necessary. Adjust settings Adjust your conditions over time. As you use our products to help you optimize your entity's performance, tighten your thresholds to keep pace with your improved performance. If you are rolling out something that you know will negatively impact your performance for a period of time, loosen your thresholds to allow for this. Disable settings You can disable any condition in a policy. This is useful, for example, if you want to continue using other conditions in the policy while you experiment with other metrics or thresholds. In most of our products (except Infrastructure), the color-coded health status indicator in the user interface changes as the alerting threshold escalates or returns to normal. This allows you to monitor a situation through our UI before a critical threshold passes, without needing to receive specific notifications about it. There are two violation thresholds: critical (red) and warning (yellow). Define these thresholds with different criteria, keeping in mind the suggestions above. Important Warning violations do not open incidents. A critical violation can open incidents, but you must define that decision through your incident preferences. Decide what happens when there's no signal Loss of signal occurs when New Relic stops receiving data for a while; technically, we detect loss of signal after a significant amount of time has elapsed since data was last received in a time series. Loss of signal can be used to trigger or resolve a violation, which you can use to set up alerts. You can configure loss of signal settings by condition in the UI or configure loss of signal via the NerdGraph API. Use non-null values when there's no signal By default, gaps in data signals are filled with null values. In cases where you need to be able to create conditions based on those data gaps, you can fill gaps with a custom value or the last known value. You can configure this setting by condition in the UI or configure gap filling values via NerdGraph Define your incident preferences Decide when you get incident notifications so you can respond to incidents when they happen. If you’re new to Alerts, learn more about your incident preferences options. The default incident preference setting combines all conditions within a policy into one incident. Change your default incident preference setting to increase or decrease the number of incidents and incident notifications you receive. Each team within your organization will have different needs. Ask your team two important questions when deciding your incident preferences: Do we want to be notified every time something goes wrong? Do we want to group all similar notifications together and be notified once? When a policy and its conditions have a broader scope (like managing the performance of several entities), increase the amount of incidents you receive. You will need more notifications because two incidents will not necessarily relate to each other. When a policy and its conditions have a focused scope (like managing the performance of one entity), opt for the default incident preference. You will need less notifications when two incidents are related to each other or when the team is already notified and fixing an existing problem. Decide how you get incident notifications by using our notification channel best practices. Select your notification channels Tailor notifications to the most useful channel and policy so you can avoid alert fatigue and help the right personnel receive and respond to incidents they care about in a systematic way. If you’re new to Alerts, learn how to set up notification channels. Notify teams and individuals who needs to stay updated on or resolve a problem when an incident arises. To stay updated, select a notification channel that is less intrusive, like email. For vital notifications and incident responses, select a notification channel that is more intrusive, like PagerDuty or Slack. Do not rely on email for quick notifications in case of delays. Understand muting rules Mute alerts during routine events, such as maintenance or planned downtime. You can also silence a policy, a specific entity, and a condition when needed. Incidents can still be opened, but you won't be notified. If you're new to Alerts, learn how to create and manage muting rules. What's next? To learn more about using alerts: Learn about the API.

      "body": "Application monitoring tips you need to know It's one thing to know how to use APM, but it's another thing to know how to use New Relic's application performance monitoring software well. Here are some best practices designed to help you become an APM pro—and a key asset to your team! Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. 1. Standardize application names Most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as \"My Application\" or \"PHP Application,\" if you don't specify one in your New Relic configuration file. You don't want to end up with 20 identically named applications, be sure to select a descriptive identifier for your apps as soon you deploy them. To keep things consistent and easy to navigate, New Relic recommends standardizing your application naming (for example, all apps in Staging append [ Staging] or the like at the end of their names). Ideally, you want your new Java applications to be named automatically to reduce the chances of typographical errors and misnaming. How to do it For Java applications, automatic application naming can come from the following sources: Request attribute Servlet init parameter Filter init parameter Web app context parameter Web app context name (display name) Web app context path Choose the method that fits best your needs and follow these steps. For non-Java applications, there are no automatic naming methods, so refer to the documentation for your APM agent. 2. Add tags to your applications When several different applications use the same account, and each application spans multiple environments (for example, development, test, pre-production, production), it can be hard to find a specific application in your overview dashboard. That's why we recommend adding tags to your apps so that you can segment them into logical groups. The two most common tags that mature APM customers use are application name and environment. So, for example, if you wanted to view the billing application in Test, you could simply filter by \"billing app\" (name tag) and \"test\" (environment tag). Caution In the APM agent configuration settings files, use the labels field to add tags to your data. For example, see this description of the Python labels setting. APM is designed so that apps can roll up into an unlimited number of meaningful tag categories. How to do it Learn about tags. Learn how to add tags. Learn how to query tags. 3. Create and evaluate alert policies When key performance indicators spike or drop, individuals and teams in your organization need to be notified. Alerting in New Relic provides a set of tools including dynamic baselines that allow you to detect problems before they impact your end users. Alert policies can be set up in two primary ways: Static threshold alerts are great when you already know the nature of an application and its normal behaviors aren't likely to change anytime soon. Apdex score, response time, error rate, throughput are some of the static thresholds you can create alert policies on. Dynamic baseline alerts make it easy to determine and set dynamic alert thresholds for applications with varying seasonal patterns and growth trends (which make it difficult to set thresholds that define normal behavior). These alerts use baselines modeled from your application’s historical metric data. Each alert policy can contain as many conditions as you need, and each alert condition includes three components: Type of condition (metric, external service, and so on) Entities that the policy targets (for example, APM apps, browser monitoring apps, or hosts) Thresholds that escalate into alerting situations with increasing severity Once you have your alerting set up, you then want to make sure you're taking advantage of all viable notification channels. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can manage alerts by creating specific user groups and by leveraging New Relic's integrated alert channels, including Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks, and email. Be sure to evaluate alert policies on a regular basis to ensure that they are always valid. How to do it See the detailed documentation: To set up dynamic baseline alerts and choose an application, follow standard procedures. You will see a preview of the metric with the predicted baseline You can select a metric for that application and see the corresponding baseline. Then, using the threshold sliders, you can set how closely you want your threshold to follow the baseline prediction. To set up static threshold alerts for your Apdex settings, follow standard procedures. To set up your alert notification channels, follow standard procedures. 4. Identify and set up key transactions Depending on the nature of your application, some transactions may be more important to you than others. New Relic's key transactions feature is designed to help you closely monitor what you consider to be your app's most business-critical transactions, whether that's end-user or app response time, call counts, error rates, or something else. You can also set alert threshold levels for notifications when your key transactions are performing poorly. How to do it In the menu bar, select More > Key transactions, and then select Add more. Then select the app and web transaction or, from the selected transaction, select Track as key transaction. Type a name for the key transaction, and select Track key transaction. Optional: If the agent for the selected app supports custom alerting, use the default values that New Relic automatically fills, or select Edit key alert transaction policy to set the Apdex and alert threshold values. To view the key transactions dashboard details, select View new key transaction. 5. Track deployment history When development teams are pushing new code out as frequently as possible, it can be hard to measure the impact that each deployment is having on performance. One way to stay in tune with how these changes are affecting your application is with deployment reports. These reports list recent deployments and their impact on end-users and app servers' Apdex scores, along with response times, throughput, and errors. You can also view and drill down into the details to catch errors related to recent deployments, or file a ticket and share details with your team. How to do it From the New Relic menu bar, select APM > (selected app) > Events > Deployments. To view performance after a deployment, go to the selected app's Overview dashboard in the Recent events section. A blue vertical bar on a chart indicates a deployment. To view summary information about the deployment, point to the blue bar. 6. Review APM reports From SLA, deployment, and capacity to scalability, host usage reports, and more, APM offers a variety of downloadable reporting tools surfacing historical trends—all great ways to report to senior executive teams or customers. Take a look at the full list of reports and use them to your advantage. How to do it From the APM menu bar, select Applications > (selected app) > Reports. Select the report you'd like to see. If you want to save or export a report to share, select Download this report as .csv, which will create a report with comma-separated values. 7. Review your environment with service maps Use New Relic service maps, a feature included in APM, to understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and talk to each other. Service maps are visual, customizable representations of your application architecture. Maps automatically show you your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. How to do it Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps. To get started, see Introduction to service maps. 8. Keep current With New Relic’s SaaS platform, getting new features is as easy as updating your agent. Most likely your organization already has a set of scripts for deploying application upgrades into your environment. In a similar fashion, you can also automate your New Relic agent deployment to ensure that your systems are up to date. Both Puppet and Chef scripts are great examples of deployment frameworks that make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. How to do it Regularly review which version of the agent you're using so that you know when an update is needed. If the latest agent release contains a needed fix or added functionality, download it. To deploy the agent automatically (preferred as a method to avoid errors): Use existing deployment scripts, provided they can be adapted to handle the deployment. OR Create and maintain a script that specifically deploys and configures the New Relic agent. Ideally, the script would pull the agent files from a repository where the files are versioned (for rollback purposes). Once the script has been created, shut down the application (unless script handles this). Run the deployment script. Start the application (unless script handles this). If problems arise, run the script to roll back to the previous version. To deploy the agent manually: Back up the current agent directory. Deploy the updated agent into the existing agent directory. Modify configuration files by comparing new files with existing files. In particular, make sure things like license key and custom extensions are copied over to the new configuration. Restart the application. If problems arise, restore the old agent using the backup and restart. 9.

      "body": "Want even longer periods of uninterrupted sleep? Here are eight best practices to make dynamic infrastructure and server monitoring even easier with New Relic's infrastructure monitoring. 1. Install the infrastructure agent across your entire environment Our infrastructure monitoring solution was designed to help enterprise customers monitor their large and dynamically changing environments at scale. In order to facilitate this, the UI is completely driven by tags that let you visualize aggregated metrics, events, and inventory for a large number of servers. To really get the most out of infrastructure monitoring, we recommend installing it across your entire environment, preferably even across multiple regions and clusters. This will provide a more accurate picture of the health of your host ecosystem and the impact your infrastructure has on your applications. Want to achieve faster Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR)? Install the infrastructure agent on database servers, web servers, and any other host that supports your applications. When deploying the agent, leverage custom attributes to tag your hosts so that you can use those for filtering the data presented in the UI and for setting alerts. This is in addition to any Amazon EC2 tags you may be using which will auto-import when you enable the EC2 integration. You may also prefer to keep the agent logs separate from the system logs, which you can do through the configuration. How to do it Leverage our install modules for config management tools such as Chef, Puppet and Ansible to easily deploy your agent across all your infrastructure. Read the instructions in the github repo for your config management tool referenced in the link above and define the custom_attributes you want to use to tag your hosts. Set the log_file attribute to your preferred location for the infrastructure agent logs. Tip If you are installing the agent on a single host, the process should only take a few minutes and you can find detailed instructions in our documentation. 2. Configure the native EC2 integration If you have an AWS environment, in addition to installing the infrastructure agent on your EC2 instances to monitor them, we also recommend configuring the EC2 integration so that New Relic can automatically import all the tags and metadata associated with your AWS instances. This allows you to filter down to a part of your infrastructure using the same AWS tags (example, ECTag_Role='Kafka'), and slice-and-dice your data in multiple ways. Additionally, our ‘Alerts’ and ‘Saved Filter Sets’ are completely tag-driven and dynamic, so they automatically add/remove instances matching these tags to give our users the most real-time views that scale with your cloud infrastructure. 3. Activate the integrations Monitoring your infrastructure extends beyond just CPU, memory, and storage utilization. That’s why New Relic has out-of-the-box integrations that allow you to monitor all the services that support your hosts as well. Activate any of our integrations, including AWS Billing, AWS ELB, Amazon S3, MySQL, NGINX, and more, to extend monitoring to your AWS or on-host applications, and access the pre-configured dashboards that appear for each of them. 4. Create filter sets With New Relic, users can create filter sets to organize hosts, cluster roles, and other resources based on criteria that matter the most to users. This allows you to optimize your resources by using a focused view to monitor, detect, and resolve any problems proactively. The attributes for filtering are populated from the auto-imported EC2 tags or custom tags that may be applied to hosts. You can combine as many filters as you want in a filter set, and save them to share with other people in your account. You’ll also be able to see the color-coded health status of each host inside the filter set, so you can quickly identify problematic areas of your infrastructure. Additionally, filter sets can be used in the health map to get an overview of your infrastructure performance at a glance based on the filters that matter to your teams. 5. Create alert conditions With New Relic, you can create alert conditions directly within the context of what you are currently monitoring with New Relic. For example, if you are viewing a filter set comprised of a large number of hosts and notice a problem, you don’t need to create an individual alert condition for every host within. Instead, we recommend initiating the alert condition directly from the chart of the metric you are viewing and creating it based on the filter tags. This will create an alert condition for any hosts that match those tags, allowing our infrastructure monitoring to automatically remove hosts that go offline and add new hosts to the alert condition if they match those tags. Alerts configured once for the appropriate tags will scale correctly across all future hosts. And know that you can also leverage existing alert policies for infrastructure alert conditions. 6. View infrastructure data alongside APM data The integration between APM and infrastructure monitoring lets you see your APM data and infrastructure data side by side, so you can find the root cause of problems more quickly, no matter where they originate. This allows users to view the performance relationship of your hosts and the applications running on them, allowing for quicker diagnosis of the issue and impact on the business’ health. Use health maps to quickly spot any issues or alerts related to the health of your applications and how that connects to the supporting infrastructure. The first boxes starting from the top left are those that require your attention. 7. Access Infrastructure data using the Data explorer Teams that use multiple New Relic capabilities find it useful to create a single dashboard to visually correlate the infrastructure’s health with application, browser and synthetics metrics. That’s where New Relic data exploration features comes in. All the granular metrics and events collected by infrastructure monitoring are stored in New Relic and are accessible to you immediately. Having access to the raw metrics means you can run more custom queries using NRQL, and also create dashboards to share infrastructure metrics with your team. 8. Update your agents regularly New Relic’s software engineering team is constantly pushing out improvements and new features to improve our customers’ overall monitoring experience. In order to take advantage of all the awesomeness they’re delivering, we recommend regularly updating to the latest version of the infrastructure agent. Want more user tips?

Read on to learn the best practices for: Policies Notification channels Incident preferences Thresholds and violations Muting rules Recommended alerts Use recommended alerts conditions conditions if you are new to Alerts or if you want suggestions that optimize your alert coverage. Organize your policies A policy is a container for similar conditions. If you’re new to Alerts, learn how to create, edit, or find policies. Organize your policy's scope to a single entity when possible. Assign your policy to the essential team or teams that need to be notified when an incident occurs. This way, you keep policies centralized and focused. If a team is monitoring several groups of the same entity type, combine those entity clusters (like servers) together into one policy. This way, your team can be notified from one policy rather than navigating several policies at once. You can use Alerts to monitor all of your entities. Consider your role and priorities when assigning yourself to a policy. For example: Software developers may need notifications for both front-end and back-end performance, such as webpage response time and page load JavaScript errors. Operations personnel may need notifications for poor back-end performance, such as server memory and load averages. The product owner may need notifications for positive front-end performance, such as improved end user Apdex scores or sales being monitored in dashboards. Set your condition thresholds and violations Set meaningful threshold levels to optimize Alerts for your business. Here are some suggested guidelines: Action Recommendations Set threshold levels Avoid setting thresholds too low. For example, if you set a CPU condition threshold of 75% for 5 minutes on your production servers, and it routinely goes over that level, this will increase the likelihood of un-actionable alerts or false positives. Experimenting with settings You do not need to edit files or restart software, so feel free to make quick changes to your threshold levels and adjust as necessary. Adjust settings Adjust your conditions over time. As you use our products to help you optimize your entity's performance, tighten your thresholds to keep pace with your improved performance. If you are rolling out something that you know will negatively impact your performance for a period of time, loosen your thresholds to allow for this. Disable settings You can disable any condition in a policy. This is useful, for example, if you want to continue using other conditions in the policy while you experiment with other metrics or thresholds. In most of our products (except Infrastructure), the color-coded health status indicator in the user interface changes as the alerting threshold escalates or returns to normal. This allows you to monitor a situation through our UI before a critical threshold passes, without needing to receive specific notifications about it. There are two violation thresholds: critical (red) and warning (yellow). Define these thresholds with different criteria, keeping in mind the suggestions above. Important Warning violations do not open incidents. A critical violation can open incidents, but you must define that decision through your incident preferences. Decide what happens when there's no signal Loss of signal occurs when New Relic stops receiving data for a while; technically, we detect loss of signal after a significant amount of time has elapsed since data was last received in a time series. Loss of signal can be used to trigger or resolve a violation, which you can use to set up alerts. You can configure loss of signal settings by condition in the UI or configure loss of signal via the NerdGraph API. Use non-null values when there's no signal By default, gaps in data signals are filled with null values. In cases where you need to be able to create conditions based on those data gaps, you can fill gaps with a custom value or the last known value. You can configure this setting by condition in the UI or configure gap filling values via NerdGraph Define your incident preferences Decide when you get incident notifications so you can respond to incidents when they happen. If you’re new to Alerts, learn more about your incident preferences options. The default incident preference setting combines all conditions within a policy into one incident. Change your default incident preference setting to increase or decrease the number of incidents and incident notifications you receive. Each team within your organization will have different needs. Ask your team two important questions when deciding your incident preferences: Do we want to be notified every time something goes wrong? Do we want to group all similar notifications together and be notified once? When a policy and its conditions have a broader scope (like managing the performance of several entities), increase the amount of incidents you receive. You will need more notifications because two incidents will not necessarily relate to each other. When a policy and its conditions have a focused scope (like managing the performance of one entity), opt for the default incident preference. You will need less notifications when two incidents are related to each other or when the team is already notified and fixing an existing problem. Decide how you get incident notifications by using our notification channel best practices. Select your notification channels Tailor notifications to the most useful channel and policy so you can avoid alert fatigue and help the right personnel receive and respond to incidents they care about in a systematic way. If you’re new to Alerts, learn how to set up notification channels. Notify teams and individuals who needs to stay updated on or resolve a problem when an incident arises. To stay updated, select a notification channel that is less intrusive, like email. For vital notifications and incident responses, select a notification channel that is more intrusive, like PagerDuty or Slack. Do not rely on email for quick notifications in case of delays. Understand muting rules Mute alerts during routine events, such as maintenance or planned downtime. You can also silence a policy, a specific entity, and a condition when needed. Incidents can still be opened, but you won't be notified. If you're new to Alerts, learn how to create and manage muting rules. What's next? To learn more about using alerts: Learn about the API.

      "body": "Application monitoring tips you need to know It's one thing to know how to use APM, but it's another thing to know how to use New Relic's application performance monitoring software well. Here are some best practices designed to help you become an APM pro—and a key asset to your team! Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. 1. Standardize application names Most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as \"My Application\" or \"PHP Application,\" if you don't specify one in your New Relic configuration file. You don't want to end up with 20 identically named applications, be sure to select a descriptive identifier for your apps as soon you deploy them. To keep things consistent and easy to navigate, New Relic recommends standardizing your application naming (for example, all apps in Staging append [ Staging] or the like at the end of their names). Ideally, you want your new Java applications to be named automatically to reduce the chances of typographical errors and misnaming. How to do it For Java applications, automatic application naming can come from the following sources: Request attribute Servlet init parameter Filter init parameter Web app context parameter Web app context name (display name) Web app context path Choose the method that fits best your needs and follow these steps. For non-Java applications, there are no automatic naming methods, so refer to the documentation for your APM agent. 2. Add tags to your applications When several different applications use the same account, and each application spans multiple environments (for example, development, test, pre-production, production), it can be hard to find a specific application in your overview dashboard. That's why we recommend adding tags to your apps so that you can segment them into logical groups. The two most common tags that mature APM customers use are application name and environment. So, for example, if you wanted to view the billing application in Test, you could simply filter by \"billing app\" (name tag) and \"test\" (environment tag). Caution In the APM agent configuration settings files, use the labels field to add tags to your data. For example, see this description of the Python labels setting. APM is designed so that apps can roll up into an unlimited number of meaningful tag categories. How to do it Learn about tags. Learn how to add tags. Learn how to query tags. 3. Create and evaluate alert policies When key performance indicators spike or drop, individuals and teams in your organization need to be notified. Alerting in New Relic provides a set of tools including dynamic baselines that allow you to detect problems before they impact your end users. Alert policies can be set up in two primary ways: Static threshold alerts are great when you already know the nature of an application and its normal behaviors aren't likely to change anytime soon. Apdex score, response time, error rate, throughput are some of the static thresholds you can create alert policies on. Dynamic baseline alerts make it easy to determine and set dynamic alert thresholds for applications with varying seasonal patterns and growth trends (which make it difficult to set thresholds that define normal behavior). These alerts use baselines modeled from your application’s historical metric data. Each alert policy can contain as many conditions as you need, and each alert condition includes three components: Type of condition (metric, external service, and so on) Entities that the policy targets (for example, APM apps, browser monitoring apps, or hosts) Thresholds that escalate into alerting situations with increasing severity Once you have your alerting set up, you then want to make sure you're taking advantage of all viable notification channels. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can manage alerts by creating specific user groups and by leveraging New Relic's integrated alert channels, including Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks, and email. Be sure to evaluate alert policies on a regular basis to ensure that they are always valid. How to do it See the detailed documentation: To set up dynamic baseline alerts and choose an application, follow standard procedures. You will see a preview of the metric with the predicted baseline You can select a metric for that application and see the corresponding baseline. Then, using the threshold sliders, you can set how closely you want your threshold to follow the baseline prediction. To set up static threshold alerts for your Apdex settings, follow standard procedures. To set up your alert notification channels, follow standard procedures. 4. Identify and set up key transactions Depending on the nature of your application, some transactions may be more important to you than others. New Relic's key transactions feature is designed to help you closely monitor what you consider to be your app's most business-critical transactions, whether that's end-user or app response time, call counts, error rates, or something else. You can also set alert threshold levels for notifications when your key transactions are performing poorly. How to do it In the menu bar, select More > Key transactions, and then select Add more. Then select the app and web transaction or, from the selected transaction, select Track as key transaction. Type a name for the key transaction, and select Track key transaction. Optional: If the agent for the selected app supports custom alerting, use the default values that New Relic automatically fills, or select Edit key alert transaction policy to set the Apdex and alert threshold values. To view the key transactions dashboard details, select View new key transaction. 5. Track deployment history When development teams are pushing new code out as frequently as possible, it can be hard to measure the impact that each deployment is having on performance. One way to stay in tune with how these changes are affecting your application is with deployment reports. These reports list recent deployments and their impact on end-users and app servers' Apdex scores, along with response times, throughput, and errors. You can also view and drill down into the details to catch errors related to recent deployments, or file a ticket and share details with your team. How to do it From the New Relic menu bar, select APM > (selected app) > Events > Deployments. To view performance after a deployment, go to the selected app's Overview dashboard in the Recent events section. A blue vertical bar on a chart indicates a deployment. To view summary information about the deployment, point to the blue bar. 6. Review APM reports From SLA, deployment, and capacity to scalability, host usage reports, and more, APM offers a variety of downloadable reporting tools surfacing historical trends—all great ways to report to senior executive teams or customers. Take a look at the full list of reports and use them to your advantage. How to do it From the APM menu bar, select Applications > (selected app) > Reports. Select the report you'd like to see. If you want to save or export a report to share, select Download this report as .csv, which will create a report with comma-separated values. 7. Review your environment with service maps Use New Relic service maps, a feature included in APM, to understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and talk to each other. Service maps are visual, customizable representations of your application architecture. Maps automatically show you your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. How to do it Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps. To get started, see Introduction to service maps. 8. Keep current With New Relic’s SaaS platform, getting new features is as easy as updating your agent. Most likely your organization already has a set of scripts for deploying application upgrades into your environment. In a similar fashion, you can also automate your New Relic agent deployment to ensure that your systems are up to date. Both Puppet and Chef scripts are great examples of deployment frameworks that make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. How to do it Regularly review which version of the agent you're using so that you know when an update is needed. If the latest agent release contains a needed fix or added functionality, download it. To deploy the agent automatically (preferred as a method to avoid errors): Use existing deployment scripts, provided they can be adapted to handle the deployment. OR Create and maintain a script that specifically deploys and configures the New Relic agent. Ideally, the script would pull the agent files from a repository where the files are versioned (for rollback purposes). Once the script has been created, shut down the application (unless script handles this). Run the deployment script. Start the application (unless script handles this). If problems arise, run the script to roll back to the previous version. To deploy the agent manually: Back up the current agent directory. Deploy the updated agent into the existing agent directory. Modify configuration files by comparing new files with existing files. In particular, make sure things like license key and custom extensions are copied over to the new configuration. Restart the application. If problems arise, restore the old agent using the backup and restart. 9. Manage user access How you manage your users depends on which user model your users are on: See original user management docs See New Relic One user management docs",

If you are rolling out something that you know will negatively impact your performance for a period of time, loosen your thresholds to allow for this. Disable settings You can disable any condition in a policy. This is useful, for example, if you want to continue using other conditions in the policy while you experiment with other metrics or thresholds. In most of our products (except Infrastructure), the color-coded health status indicator in the user interface changes as the alerting threshold escalates or returns to normal. This allows you to monitor a situation through our UI before a critical threshold passes, without needing to receive specific notifications about it. There are two violation thresholds: critical (red) and warning (yellow). Define these thresholds with different criteria, keeping in mind the suggestions above. Important Warning violations do not open incidents. A critical violation can open incidents, but you must define that decision through your incident preferences. Decide what happens when there's no signal Loss of signal occurs when New Relic stops receiving data for a while; technically, we detect loss of signal after a significant amount of time has elapsed since data was last received in a time series. Loss of signal can be used to trigger or resolve a violation, which you can use to set up alerts. You can configure loss of signal settings by condition in the UI or configure loss of signal via the NerdGraph API. Use non-null values when there's no signal By default, gaps in data signals are filled with null values. In cases where you need to be able to create conditions based on those data gaps, you can fill gaps with a custom value or the last known value. You can configure this setting by condition in the UI or configure gap filling values via NerdGraph Define your incident preferences Decide when you get incident notifications so you can respond to incidents when they happen. If you’re new to Alerts, learn more about your incident preferences options. The default incident preference setting combines all conditions within a policy into one incident. Change your default incident preference setting to increase or decrease the number of incidents and incident notifications you receive. Each team within your organization will have different needs. Ask your team two important questions when deciding your incident preferences: Do we want to be notified every time something goes wrong? Do we want to group all similar notifications together and be notified once? When a policy and its conditions have a broader scope (like managing the performance of several entities), increase the amount of incidents you receive. You will need more notifications because two incidents will not necessarily relate to each other. When a policy and its conditions have a focused scope (like managing the performance of one entity), opt for the default incident preference. You will need less notifications when two incidents are related to each other or when the team is already notified and fixing an existing problem. Decide how you get incident notifications by using our notification channel best practices. Select your notification channels Tailor notifications to the most useful channel and policy so you can avoid alert fatigue and help the right personnel receive and respond to incidents they care about in a systematic way. If you’re new to Alerts, learn how to set up notification channels. Notify teams and individuals who needs to stay updated on or resolve a problem when an incident arises. To stay updated, select a notification channel that is less intrusive, like email. For vital notifications and incident responses, select a notification channel that is more intrusive, like PagerDuty or Slack. Do not rely on email for quick notifications in case of delays. Understand muting rules Mute alerts during routine events, such as maintenance or planned downtime. You can also silence a policy, a specific entity, and a condition when needed. Incidents can still be opened, but you won't be notified. If you're new to Alerts, learn how to create and manage muting rules. What's next? To learn more about using alerts: Learn about the API.

      "body": "By eliminating crashes and increasing speed across the stack, you can build better performance into every mobile app release. Here are some best practices to take full advantage of mobile monitoring with New Relic. 1. Start collecting data Start collecting data in production. You'll see immediate value by adding our mobile monitoring SDK to your app for its next release to the app store. We recommend installing the iOS or Android agent to your production release even if you're simply testing New Relic's capabilities. This will ensure you'll get an adequate amount of data to really understand all of our mobile monitoring capabilities and your end users' experience. How to do it Add your mobile app to New Relic First, add a new app in New Relic's user interface (full steps): Go to one.newrelic.com and click Mobile. From the list of monitored apps, select Add more. Select the relevant platform. Type a name for your mobile app, and select Continue. Use one app and the associated app token for the development releases of your iOS app, another app and its associated app token for the production releases of that iOS app, and another pair of app tokens for development and production releases of your Android app. You'll be able to compare data from across the four app tokens using our query builder. Install and configure our mobile SDK Next, install and configure the mobile agent: Download the latest version of New Relic's SDK for iOS or Android, and add it to your mobile app. (Full steps for iOS and Android) Configure your installation as needed. For example: Enable the feature flag to capture MobileRequest events to use our full network analysis capabilities for iOS or Android. Automate dSYM uploads for your production builds. To avoid surprises, follow the standard pattern of where you start our mobile agent. In addition, start our agent before you initiate any other SDKs. For more information, see our documentation for Android installation and configuration and for iOS installation and configuration. Deploy a new release of your application. 2. Explore your data Immediately be able to explore your data. As soon as New Relic starts reporting data, take the time to explore the wealth of information about your mobile apps. To get started, go to one.newrelic.com and select Mobile. How to do it Analyze, resolve, and prevent crashes Find the cause of crashes so you can fix them. Then, uncover trends behind crashes so you can prevent them: From the summary UI page for a monitored mobile app, click Crash analysis. Analyze crash data so you can see and fix the most impactful crashes. Follow the breadcrumbs in the crash event trail to fix crashes and resolve critical errors more easily: From your mobile app's Crash analysis page in the UI, select a Crash type. From the crash type's Summary page, select the Crash trail tab. Monitor your key workflows Create custom breadcrumbs to monitor key workflows (such as your app's login or checkout process), track user clicks, optimize timing, and identify crash locations for faster MTTR. Get actionable session data Borrow from our example queries to: See how much of your user base has upgraded to your latest app version. Track adoption over time. Get a count of new installs as compared to upgrades from an earlier version. See the distribution of usage across geographical locations, carriers, ASN owners (wi-fi providers), devices, connection types, and more. 3. Take preventive steps Use alert notifications to help uncover the causes behind crashes and errors. Once you are running our mobile monitoring capabilities in production and have explored some of the key features, you can use New Relic to uncover critical issues with your mobile application. In particular, focus on crashes and errors. Use metric-based alerts as a starting point to gain high-level visibility into problems. Then, as new services or functionalities are added, use New Relic’s more targeted, event-based (NRQL) alerts to make sure that the most critical issues are handled swiftly. Use these alerts to determine whether a crash is impacting a large number of users. If it is, the relevant people (for example, both the mobile app team’s on-call member and the owner of the related back-end service) will be alerted. Make sure that your team knows how to respond to changes in crash rate (crashes per sessions) and the percentage of users impacted by crashes of your mobile app. How to do it Metric-based alerts Use our metric-based alerts and mobile monitoring UI: Ensure that key members of your mobile team have opted in to receive emails for new crashes. These emails will take you to the crash type in the UI page for your mobile app. Create an alert for your crash rate threshold that key members of your team can view in Slack or any other Alerts notification channel you choose. Your alert notification will include a link to our UI, where you can examine a chart with the exceeded threshold. From there, a link will take you to the relevant mobile monitoring page, where you can get additional details. Event-based alerts Combine the metric-based workflow with event-based alerts and dashboards specific to your mobile app and system. Create your NRQL alert that focuses on crashes of your most recently released production version. Create an additional NRQL alert that focuses on the percentage of users impacted by crashes in your latest app version (to check the overall impact on your user base). 4. Dig deeper into crashes Take your crash reporting to the next level. Now it’s time to tackle some of those harder-to-reproduce crashes by: Applying additional instrumentation to your application. Leveraging crash event trails, NRQL queries, and dashboards to visualize your data. How to do it Crash analysis Crashes are an inevitable part of running mobile applications at scale. We provide tools to help you understand your highest-impact crashes. Use the Crash analysis UI to see which crashes are occurring most often, the percentage of crash-free users, which files and methods are associated with perhaps 80 percent of your crashes, which crashes a particular user just experienced, and more. Go after high-impact crashes with crash analysis: Add custom attributes to categorize the highest-value customers, and then use them to segment crashes according to your most valuable audiences. Add breadcrumbs and custom events to produce a detailed trail of events leading up to every crash occurrence (over the last 90 days). Then, view this crash event trail in our mobile monitoring UI. Use our mobile monitoring's Versions trends page to make sure you’re improving the crash rate over subsequent releases and avoiding regressions. Breadcrumbs Use breadcrumbs and custom attributes to better reproduce and debug crashes. For example, use our recordBreadrumb API for Android or iOS to track mid-session changes in state that can help debug crashes, such as: Change of connection type Change of orientation CPU and memory state at key points in the app code Custom attributes Add custom attributes to existing events, so you can ask even more precise questions of your mobile app. Add dimensions such as: User ID: Use to react to specific user concerns and to better understand which customers and segments are most impacted. Store ID: Use to address problems with out-of-date devices, bad wi-fi, and so on. User segments: Use to better understand which customers and segments are most impacted; for example, logged in vs. non-logged in. Money in the cart at session end Origin or attribution of entry into the app Standardize custom attribute names across your mobile apps, and align with your website (if you're using our browser monitoring), so that you can compare and contrast performance across end-user channels. The mobile agents track the last interaction of crashed and non-crashed sessions to provide visibility into what the user viewed before exiting your app (either intentionally or due to a crash). 5. Focus on KPIs Bring your key performance indicators to life. Create custom interactions and events to hone in on the most important signals, including user activity for the business-critical aspects of your app. Using these powerful APIs, you can add custom instrumentation to just about anything. The following are some example use cases. How to do it Track and query feature use Use custom events to track feature use. For example: Use custom events to track user flow between app and website. Use custom events or mobile breadcrumbs to optimize the performance of key user flows (log in, shopping cart, etc.). use custom events to provide faster, contextualized support experiences for your digital customers. Use the recordCustomEvent API. Then compare the use of different features using: SELECT count(*) FROM MyNewMobileEventType FACET name Copy Measure page load times Use custom events to measure page load time: Create an app-launch timer to measure the time that elapses between a user-tap to launch your app and the point in your app code where the first screen is available. Record the timer value in New Relic using something like the following: recordCustomEvent(<myMobileTimers>, <appLaunch>, {attributes}) Copy Define start and stop timers to measure spinner durations, and then record this time in New Relic using something like the following: recordCustomEvent(<myMobileTimers>, <spinnerOnScreenA>, {attributes}) Copy Track specific user actions or funnel steps in the app (like \"add to cart\"), and include the price as an attribute on that event. Measure flows through the application by viewing the related funnel steps with custom events in Insights. For example, create a timer to track the start and end times of a subflow or an entire flow across multiple funnel steps to understand how long it took users to get through the process. Examine data about webpage interactions Use custom interactions to see traces associated with the same webpages. Use the agent API to disable default interactions, and focus on custom interactions so that you can review the page loads that are most crucial to your primary funnel. Define the start and stop times of these custom interactions to trace activities associated with individual steps of that funnel (for example, a specific user action or a page load). Track the last interactions of crashed and non-crashed sessions so that you can see what the user viewed before exiting your app (either intentionally or from a crash). Example query for non-crashed sessions: SELECT count(*) FROM Mobile WHERE sessionCrashed is null FACET lastInteraction SINCE 90 days ago Copy Example query for crashed sessions: SELECT count(*) FROM Mobile WHERE sessionCrashed is true FACET lastInteraction SINCE 90 days ago Copy",

      "body": "Application monitoring tips you need to know It's one thing to know how to use APM, but it's another thing to know how to use New Relic's application performance monitoring software well. Here are some best practices designed to help you become an APM pro—and a key asset to your team! Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. 1. Standardize application names Most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as \"My Application\" or \"PHP Application,\" if you don't specify one in your New Relic configuration file. You don't want to end up with 20 identically named applications, be sure to select a descriptive identifier for your apps as soon you deploy them. To keep things consistent and easy to navigate, New Relic recommends standardizing your application naming (for example, all apps in Staging append [ Staging] or the like at the end of their names). Ideally, you want your new Java applications to be named automatically to reduce the chances of typographical errors and misnaming. How to do it For Java applications, automatic application naming can come from the following sources: Request attribute Servlet init parameter Filter init parameter Web app context parameter Web app context name (display name) Web app context path Choose the method that fits best your needs and follow these steps. For non-Java applications, there are no automatic naming methods, so refer to the documentation for your APM agent. 2. Add tags to your applications When several different applications use the same account, and each application spans multiple environments (for example, development, test, pre-production, production), it can be hard to find a specific application in your overview dashboard. That's why we recommend adding tags to your apps so that you can segment them into logical groups. The two most common tags that mature APM customers use are application name and environment. So, for example, if you wanted to view the billing application in Test, you could simply filter by \"billing app\" (name tag) and \"test\" (environment tag). Caution In the APM agent configuration settings files, use the labels field to add tags to your data. For example, see this description of the Python labels setting. APM is designed so that apps can roll up into an unlimited number of meaningful tag categories. How to do it Learn about tags. Learn how to add tags. Learn how to query tags. 3. Create and evaluate alert policies When key performance indicators spike or drop, individuals and teams in your organization need to be notified. Alerting in New Relic provides a set of tools including dynamic baselines that allow you to detect problems before they impact your end users. Alert policies can be set up in two primary ways: Static threshold alerts are great when you already know the nature of an application and its normal behaviors aren't likely to change anytime soon. Apdex score, response time, error rate, throughput are some of the static thresholds you can create alert policies on. Dynamic baseline alerts make it easy to determine and set dynamic alert thresholds for applications with varying seasonal patterns and growth trends (which make it difficult to set thresholds that define normal behavior). These alerts use baselines modeled from your application’s historical metric data. Each alert policy can contain as many conditions as you need, and each alert condition includes three components: Type of condition (metric, external service, and so on) Entities that the policy targets (for example, APM apps, browser monitoring apps, or hosts) Thresholds that escalate into alerting situations with increasing severity Once you have your alerting set up, you then want to make sure you're taking advantage of all viable notification channels. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can manage alerts by creating specific user groups and by leveraging New Relic's integrated alert channels, including Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks, and email. Be sure to evaluate alert policies on a regular basis to ensure that they are always valid. How to do it See the detailed documentation: To set up dynamic baseline alerts and choose an application, follow standard procedures. You will see a preview of the metric with the predicted baseline You can select a metric for that application and see the corresponding baseline. Then, using the threshold sliders, you can set how closely you want your threshold to follow the baseline prediction. To set up static threshold alerts for your Apdex settings, follow standard procedures. To set up your alert notification channels, follow standard procedures. 4. Identify and set up key transactions Depending on the nature of your application, some transactions may be more important to you than others. New Relic's key transactions feature is designed to help you closely monitor what you consider to be your app's most business-critical transactions, whether that's end-user or app response time, call counts, error rates, or something else. You can also set alert threshold levels for notifications when your key transactions are performing poorly. How to do it In the menu bar, select More > Key transactions, and then select Add more. Then select the app and web transaction or, from the selected transaction, select Track as key transaction. Type a name for the key transaction, and select Track key transaction. Optional: If the agent for the selected app supports custom alerting, use the default values that New Relic automatically fills, or select Edit key alert transaction policy to set the Apdex and alert threshold values. To view the key transactions dashboard details, select View new key transaction. 5. Track deployment history When development teams are pushing new code out as frequently as possible, it can be hard to measure the impact that each deployment is having on performance. One way to stay in tune with how these changes are affecting your application is with deployment reports. These reports list recent deployments and their impact on end-users and app servers' Apdex scores, along with response times, throughput, and errors. You can also view and drill down into the details to catch errors related to recent deployments, or file a ticket and share details with your team. How to do it From the New Relic menu bar, select APM > (selected app) > Events > Deployments. To view performance after a deployment, go to the selected app's Overview dashboard in the Recent events section. A blue vertical bar on a chart indicates a deployment. To view summary information about the deployment, point to the blue bar. 6. Review APM reports From SLA, deployment, and capacity to scalability, host usage reports, and more, APM offers a variety of downloadable reporting tools surfacing historical trends—all great ways to report to senior executive teams or customers. Take a look at the full list of reports and use them to your advantage. How to do it From the APM menu bar, select Applications > (selected app) > Reports. Select the report you'd like to see. If you want to save or export a report to share, select Download this report as .csv, which will create a report with comma-separated values. 7. Review your environment with service maps Use New Relic service maps, a feature included in APM, to understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and talk to each other. Service maps are visual, customizable representations of your application architecture. Maps automatically show you your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. How to do it Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps. To get started, see Introduction to service maps. 8. Keep current With New Relic’s SaaS platform, getting new features is as easy as updating your agent. Most likely your organization already has a set of scripts for deploying application upgrades into your environment. In a similar fashion, you can also automate your New Relic agent deployment to ensure that your systems are up to date. Both Puppet and Chef scripts are great examples of deployment frameworks that make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. How to do it Regularly review which version of the agent you're using so that you know when an update is needed. If the latest agent release contains a needed fix or added functionality, download it. To deploy the agent automatically (preferred as a method to avoid errors): Use existing deployment scripts, provided they can be adapted to handle the deployment. OR Create and maintain a script that specifically deploys and configures the New Relic agent. Ideally, the script would pull the agent files from a repository where the files are versioned (for rollback purposes). Once the script has been created, shut down the application (unless script handles this). Run the deployment script. Start the application (unless script handles this). If problems arise, run the script to roll back to the previous version. To deploy the agent manually: Back up the current agent directory. Deploy the updated agent into the existing agent directory. Modify configuration files by comparing new files with existing files. In particular, make sure things like license key and custom extensions are copied over to the new configuration. Restart the application. If problems arise, restore the old agent using the backup and restart. 9. Manage user access How you manage your users depends on which user model your users are on: See original user management docs See New Relic One user management docs",

Install the infrastructure agent on database servers, web servers, and any other host that supports your applications. When deploying the agent, leverage custom attributes to tag your hosts so that you can use those for filtering the data presented in the UI and for setting alerts. This is in addition to any Amazon EC2 tags you may be using which will auto-import when you enable the EC2 integration. You may also prefer to keep the agent logs separate from the system logs, which you can do through the configuration. How to do it Leverage our install modules for config management tools such as Chef, Puppet and Ansible to easily deploy your agent across all your infrastructure. Read the instructions in the github repo for your config management tool referenced in the link above and define the custom_attributes you want to use to tag your hosts. Set the log_file attribute to your preferred location for the infrastructure agent logs. Tip If you are installing the agent on a single host, the process should only take a few minutes and you can find detailed instructions in our documentation. 2. Configure the native EC2 integration If you have an AWS environment, in addition to installing the infrastructure agent on your EC2 instances to monitor them, we also recommend configuring the EC2 integration so that New Relic can automatically import all the tags and metadata associated with your AWS instances. This allows you to filter down to a part of your infrastructure using the same AWS tags (example, ECTag_Role='Kafka'), and slice-and-dice your data in multiple ways. Additionally, our ‘Alerts’ and ‘Saved Filter Sets’ are completely tag-driven and dynamic, so they automatically add/remove instances matching these tags to give our users the most real-time views that scale with your cloud infrastructure. 3. Activate the integrations Monitoring your infrastructure extends beyond just CPU, memory, and storage utilization. That’s why New Relic has out-of-the-box integrations that allow you to monitor all the services that support your hosts as well. Activate any of our integrations, including AWS Billing, AWS ELB, Amazon S3, MySQL, NGINX, and more, to extend monitoring to your AWS or on-host applications, and access the pre-configured dashboards that appear for each of them. 4. Create filter sets With New Relic, users can create filter sets to organize hosts, cluster roles, and other resources based on criteria that matter the most to users. This allows you to optimize your resources by using a focused view to monitor, detect, and resolve any problems proactively. The attributes for filtering are populated from the auto-imported EC2 tags or custom tags that may be applied to hosts. You can combine as many filters as you want in a filter set, and save them to share with other people in your account. You’ll also be able to see the color-coded health status of each host inside the filter set, so you can quickly identify problematic areas of your infrastructure. Additionally, filter sets can be used in the health map to get an overview of your infrastructure performance at a glance based on the filters that matter to your teams. 5. Create alert conditions With New Relic, you can create alert conditions directly within the context of what you are currently monitoring with New Relic. For example, if you are viewing a filter set comprised of a large number of hosts and notice a problem, you don’t need to create an individual alert condition for every host within. Instead, we recommend initiating the alert condition directly from the chart of the metric you are viewing and creating it based on the filter tags. This will create an alert condition for any hosts that match those tags, allowing our infrastructure monitoring to automatically remove hosts that go offline and add new hosts to the alert condition if they match those tags. Alerts configured once for the appropriate tags will scale correctly across all future hosts. And know that you can also leverage existing alert policies for infrastructure alert conditions. 6. View infrastructure data alongside APM data The integration between APM and infrastructure monitoring lets you see your APM data and infrastructure data side by side, so you can find the root cause of problems more quickly, no matter where they originate. This allows users to view the performance relationship of your hosts and the applications running on them, allowing for quicker diagnosis of the issue and impact on the business’ health. Use health maps to quickly spot any issues or alerts related to the health of your applications and how that connects to the supporting infrastructure. The first boxes starting from the top left are those that require your attention. 7. Access Infrastructure data using the Data explorer Teams that use multiple New Relic capabilities find it useful to create a single dashboard to visually correlate the infrastructure’s health with application, browser and synthetics metrics. That’s where New Relic data exploration features comes in. All the granular metrics and events collected by infrastructure monitoring are stored in New Relic and are accessible to you immediately. Having access to the raw metrics means you can run more custom queries using NRQL, and also create dashboards to share infrastructure metrics with your team. 8. Update your agents regularly New Relic’s software engineering team is constantly pushing out improvements and new features to improve our customers’ overall monitoring experience. In order to take advantage of all the awesomeness they’re delivering, we recommend regularly updating to the latest version of the infrastructure agent. Want more user tips?

Read on to learn the best practices for: Policies Notification channels Incident preferences Thresholds and violations Muting rules Recommended alerts Use recommended alerts conditions conditions if you are new to Alerts or if you want suggestions that optimize your alert coverage. Organize your policies A policy is a container for similar conditions. If you’re new to Alerts, learn how to create, edit, or find policies. Organize your policy's scope to a single entity when possible. Assign your policy to the essential team or teams that need to be notified when an incident occurs. This way, you keep policies centralized and focused. If a team is monitoring several groups of the same entity type, combine those entity clusters (like servers) together into one policy. This way, your team can be notified from one policy rather than navigating several policies at once. You can use Alerts to monitor all of your entities. Consider your role and priorities when assigning yourself to a policy. For example: Software developers may need notifications for both front-end and back-end performance, such as webpage response time and page load JavaScript errors. Operations personnel may need notifications for poor back-end performance, such as server memory and load averages. The product owner may need notifications for positive front-end performance, such as improved end user Apdex scores or sales being monitored in dashboards. Set your condition thresholds and violations Set meaningful threshold levels to optimize Alerts for your business. Here are some suggested guidelines: Action Recommendations Set threshold levels Avoid setting thresholds too low. For example, if you set a CPU condition threshold of 75% for 5 minutes on your production servers, and it routinely goes over that level, this will increase the likelihood of un-actionable alerts or false positives. Experimenting with settings You do not need to edit files or restart software, so feel free to make quick changes to your threshold levels and adjust as necessary. Adjust settings Adjust your conditions over time. As you use our products to help you optimize your entity's performance, tighten your thresholds to keep pace with your improved performance. If you are rolling out something that you know will negatively impact your performance for a period of time, loosen your thresholds to allow for this. Disable settings You can disable any condition in a policy. This is useful, for example, if you want to continue using other conditions in the policy while you experiment with other metrics or thresholds. In most of our products (except Infrastructure), the color-coded health status indicator in the user interface changes as the alerting threshold escalates or returns to normal. This allows you to monitor a situation through our UI before a critical threshold passes, without needing to receive specific notifications about it. There are two violation thresholds: critical (red) and warning (yellow). Define these thresholds with different criteria, keeping in mind the suggestions above. Important Warning violations do not open incidents. A critical violation can open incidents, but you must define that decision through your incident preferences. Decide what happens when there's no signal Loss of signal occurs when New Relic stops receiving data for a while; technically, we detect loss of signal after a significant amount of time has elapsed since data was last received in a time series. Loss of signal can be used to trigger or resolve a violation, which you can use to set up alerts. You can configure loss of signal settings by condition in the UI or configure loss of signal via the NerdGraph API. Use non-null values when there's no signal By default, gaps in data signals are filled with null values. In cases where you need to be able to create conditions based on those data gaps, you can fill gaps with a custom value or the last known value. You can configure this setting by condition in the UI or configure gap filling values via NerdGraph Define your incident preferences Decide when you get incident notifications so you can respond to incidents when they happen. If you’re new to Alerts, learn more about your incident preferences options. The default incident preference setting combines all conditions within a policy into one incident. Change your default incident preference setting to increase or decrease the number of incidents and incident notifications you receive. Each team within your organization will have different needs. Ask your team two important questions when deciding your incident preferences: Do we want to be notified every time something goes wrong? Do we want to group all similar notifications together and be notified once? When a policy and its conditions have a broader scope (like managing the performance of several entities), increase the amount of incidents you receive. You will need more notifications because two incidents will not necessarily relate to each other. When a policy and its conditions have a focused scope (like managing the performance of one entity), opt for the default incident preference. You will need less notifications when two incidents are related to each other or when the team is already notified and fixing an existing problem. Decide how you get incident notifications by using our notification channel best practices. Select your notification channels Tailor notifications to the most useful channel and policy so you can avoid alert fatigue and help the right personnel receive and respond to incidents they care about in a systematic way. If you’re new to Alerts, learn how to set up notification channels. Notify teams and individuals who needs to stay updated on or resolve a problem when an incident arises. To stay updated, select a notification channel that is less intrusive, like email. For vital notifications and incident responses, select a notification channel that is more intrusive, like PagerDuty or Slack. Do not rely on email for quick notifications in case of delays. Understand muting rules Mute alerts during routine events, such as maintenance or planned downtime. You can also silence a policy, a specific entity, and a condition when needed. Incidents can still be opened, but you won't be notified. If you're new to Alerts, learn how to create and manage muting rules. What's next? To learn more about using alerts: Learn about the API.

      "body": "Application monitoring tips you need to know It's one thing to know how to use APM, but it's another thing to know how to use New Relic's application performance monitoring software well. Here are some best practices designed to help you become an APM pro—and a key asset to your team! Tip To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the New Relic Explorer in New Relic One. 1. Standardize application names Most New Relic agents provide a default application name, such as \"My Application\" or \"PHP Application,\" if you don't specify one in your New Relic configuration file. You don't want to end up with 20 identically named applications, be sure to select a descriptive identifier for your apps as soon you deploy them. To keep things consistent and easy to navigate, New Relic recommends standardizing your application naming (for example, all apps in Staging append [ Staging] or the like at the end of their names). Ideally, you want your new Java applications to be named automatically to reduce the chances of typographical errors and misnaming. How to do it For Java applications, automatic application naming can come from the following sources: Request attribute Servlet init parameter Filter init parameter Web app context parameter Web app context name (display name) Web app context path Choose the method that fits best your needs and follow these steps. For non-Java applications, there are no automatic naming methods, so refer to the documentation for your APM agent. 2. Add tags to your applications When several different applications use the same account, and each application spans multiple environments (for example, development, test, pre-production, production), it can be hard to find a specific application in your overview dashboard. That's why we recommend adding tags to your apps so that you can segment them into logical groups. The two most common tags that mature APM customers use are application name and environment. So, for example, if you wanted to view the billing application in Test, you could simply filter by \"billing app\" (name tag) and \"test\" (environment tag). Caution In the APM agent configuration settings files, use the labels field to add tags to your data. For example, see this description of the Python labels setting. APM is designed so that apps can roll up into an unlimited number of meaningful tag categories. How to do it Learn about tags. Learn how to add tags. Learn how to query tags. 3. Create and evaluate alert policies When key performance indicators spike or drop, individuals and teams in your organization need to be notified. Alerting in New Relic provides a set of tools including dynamic baselines that allow you to detect problems before they impact your end users. Alert policies can be set up in two primary ways: Static threshold alerts are great when you already know the nature of an application and its normal behaviors aren't likely to change anytime soon. Apdex score, response time, error rate, throughput are some of the static thresholds you can create alert policies on. Dynamic baseline alerts make it easy to determine and set dynamic alert thresholds for applications with varying seasonal patterns and growth trends (which make it difficult to set thresholds that define normal behavior). These alerts use baselines modeled from your application’s historical metric data. Each alert policy can contain as many conditions as you need, and each alert condition includes three components: Type of condition (metric, external service, and so on) Entities that the policy targets (for example, APM apps, browser monitoring apps, or hosts) Thresholds that escalate into alerting situations with increasing severity Once you have your alerting set up, you then want to make sure you're taking advantage of all viable notification channels. After all, what good are alerts if no one knows about them? You can manage alerts by creating specific user groups and by leveraging New Relic's integrated alert channels, including Slack, PagerDuty, webhooks, and email. Be sure to evaluate alert policies on a regular basis to ensure that they are always valid. How to do it See the detailed documentation: To set up dynamic baseline alerts and choose an application, follow standard procedures. You will see a preview of the metric with the predicted baseline You can select a metric for that application and see the corresponding baseline. Then, using the threshold sliders, you can set how closely you want your threshold to follow the baseline prediction. To set up static threshold alerts for your Apdex settings, follow standard procedures. To set up your alert notification channels, follow standard procedures. 4. Identify and set up key transactions Depending on the nature of your application, some transactions may be more important to you than others. New Relic's key transactions feature is designed to help you closely monitor what you consider to be your app's most business-critical transactions, whether that's end-user or app response time, call counts, error rates, or something else. You can also set alert threshold levels for notifications when your key transactions are performing poorly. How to do it In the menu bar, select More > Key transactions, and then select Add more. Then select the app and web transaction or, from the selected transaction, select Track as key transaction. Type a name for the key transaction, and select Track key transaction. Optional: If the agent for the selected app supports custom alerting, use the default values that New Relic automatically fills, or select Edit key alert transaction policy to set the Apdex and alert threshold values. To view the key transactions dashboard details, select View new key transaction. 5. Track deployment history When development teams are pushing new code out as frequently as possible, it can be hard to measure the impact that each deployment is having on performance. One way to stay in tune with how these changes are affecting your application is with deployment reports. These reports list recent deployments and their impact on end-users and app servers' Apdex scores, along with response times, throughput, and errors. You can also view and drill down into the details to catch errors related to recent deployments, or file a ticket and share details with your team. How to do it From the New Relic menu bar, select APM > (selected app) > Events > Deployments. To view performance after a deployment, go to the selected app's Overview dashboard in the Recent events section. A blue vertical bar on a chart indicates a deployment. To view summary information about the deployment, point to the blue bar. 6. Review APM reports From SLA, deployment, and capacity to scalability, host usage reports, and more, APM offers a variety of downloadable reporting tools surfacing historical trends—all great ways to report to senior executive teams or customers. Take a look at the full list of reports and use them to your advantage. How to do it From the APM menu bar, select Applications > (selected app) > Reports. Select the report you'd like to see. If you want to save or export a report to share, select Download this report as .csv, which will create a report with comma-separated values. 7. Review your environment with service maps Use New Relic service maps, a feature included in APM, to understand how apps and services in your architecture connect and talk to each other. Service maps are visual, customizable representations of your application architecture. Maps automatically show you your app's connections and dependencies, including databases and external services. Health indicators and performance metrics show you the current operational status for every part of your architecture. How to do it Go to one.newrelic.com > More > Service maps. To get started, see Introduction to service maps. 8. Keep current With New Relic’s SaaS platform, getting new features is as easy as updating your agent. Most likely your organization already has a set of scripts for deploying application upgrades into your environment. In a similar fashion, you can also automate your New Relic agent deployment to ensure that your systems are up to date. Both Puppet and Chef scripts are great examples of deployment frameworks that make life easier by allowing you to automate your entire deployment and management process. How to do it Regularly review which version of the agent you're using so that you know when an update is needed. If the latest agent release contains a needed fix or added functionality, download it. To deploy the agent automatically (preferred as a method to avoid errors): Use existing deployment scripts, provided they can be adapted to handle the deployment. OR Create and maintain a script that specifically deploys and configures the New Relic agent. Ideally, the script would pull the agent files from a repository where the files are versioned (for rollback purposes). Once the script has been created, shut down the application (unless script handles this). Run the deployment script. Start the application (unless script handles this). If problems arise, run the script to roll back to the previous version. To deploy the agent manually: Back up the current agent directory. Deploy the updated agent into the existing agent directory. Modify configuration files by comparing new files with existing files. In particular, make sure things like license key and custom extensions are copied over to the new configuration. Restart the application. If problems arise, restore the old agent using the backup and restart. 9. Manage user access How you manage your users depends on which user model your users are on: See original user management docs See New Relic One user management docs",

      "body": "Want even longer periods of uninterrupted sleep? Here are eight best practices to make dynamic infrastructure and server monitoring even easier with New Relic's infrastructure monitoring. 1. Install the infrastructure agent across your entire environment Our infrastructure monitoring solution was designed to help enterprise customers monitor their large and dynamically changing environments at scale. In order to facilitate this, the UI is completely driven by tags that let you visualize aggregated metrics, events, and inventory for a large number of servers. To really get the most out of infrastructure monitoring, we recommend installing it across your entire environment, preferably even across multiple regions and clusters. This will provide a more accurate picture of the health of your host ecosystem and the impact your infrastructure has on your applications. Want to achieve faster Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR)? Install the infrastructure agent on database servers, web servers, and any other host that supports your applications. When deploying the agent, leverage custom attributes to tag your hosts so that you can use those for filtering the data presented in the UI and for setting alerts. This is in addition to any Amazon EC2 tags you may be using which will auto-import when you enable the EC2 integration. You may also prefer to keep the agent logs separate from the system logs, which you can do through the configuration. How to do it Leverage our install modules for config management tools such as Chef, Puppet and Ansible to easily deploy your agent across all your infrastructure. Read the instructions in the github repo for your config management tool referenced in the link above and define the custom_attributes you want to use to tag your hosts. Set the log_file attribute to your preferred location for the infrastructure agent logs. Tip If you are installing the agent on a single host, the process should only take a few minutes and you can find detailed instructions in our documentation. 2. Configure the native EC2 integration If you have an AWS environment, in addition to installing the infrastructure agent on your EC2 instances to monitor them, we also recommend configuring the EC2 integration so that New Relic can automatically import all the tags and metadata associated with your AWS instances. This allows you to filter down to a part of your infrastructure using the same AWS tags (example, ECTag_Role='Kafka'), and slice-and-dice your data in multiple ways. Additionally, our ‘Alerts’ and ‘Saved Filter Sets’ are completely tag-driven and dynamic, so they automatically add/remove instances matching these tags to give our users the most real-time views that scale with your cloud infrastructure. 3. Activate the integrations Monitoring your infrastructure extends beyond just CPU, memory, and storage utilization. That’s why New Relic has out-of-the-box integrations that allow you to monitor all the services that support your hosts as well. Activate any of our integrations, including AWS Billing, AWS ELB, Amazon S3, MySQL, NGINX, and more, to extend monitoring to your AWS or on-host applications, and access the pre-configured dashboards that appear for each of them. 4. Create filter sets With New Relic, users can create filter sets to organize hosts, cluster roles, and other resources based on criteria that matter the most to users. This allows you to optimize your resources by using a focused view to monitor, detect, and resolve any problems proactively. The attributes for filtering are populated from the auto-imported EC2 tags or custom tags that may be applied to hosts. You can combine as many filters as you want in a filter set, and save them to share with other people in your account. You’ll also be able to see the color-coded health status of each host inside the filter set, so you can quickly identify problematic areas of your infrastructure. Additionally, filter sets can be used in the health map to get an overview of your infrastructure performance at a glance based on the filters that matter to your teams. 5. Create alert conditions With New Relic, you can create alert conditions directly within the context of what you are currently monitoring with New Relic. For example, if you are viewing a filter set comprised of a large number of hosts and notice a problem, you don’t need to create an individual alert condition for every host within. Instead, we recommend initiating the alert condition directly from the chart of the metric you are viewing and creating it based on the filter tags. This will create an alert condition for any hosts that match those tags, allowing our infrastructure monitoring to automatically remove hosts that go offline and add new hosts to the alert condition if they match those tags. Alerts configured once for the appropriate tags will scale correctly across all future hosts. And know that you can also leverage existing alert policies for infrastructure alert conditions. 6. View infrastructure data alongside APM data The integration between APM and infrastructure monitoring lets you see your APM data and infrastructure data side by side, so you can find the root cause of problems more quickly, no matter where they originate. This allows users to view the performance relationship of your hosts and the applications running on them, allowing for quicker diagnosis of the issue and impact on the business’ health. Use health maps to quickly spot any issues or alerts related to the health of your applications and how that connects to the supporting infrastructure. The first boxes starting from the top left are those that require your attention. 7. Access Infrastructure data using the Data explorer Teams that use multiple New Relic capabilities find it useful to create a single dashboard to visually correlate the infrastructure’s health with application, browser and synthetics metrics. That’s where New Relic data exploration features comes in. All the granular metrics and events collected by infrastructure monitoring are stored in New Relic and are accessible to you immediately. Having access to the raw metrics means you can run more custom queries using NRQL, and also create dashboards to share infrastructure metrics with your team. 8. Update your agents regularly New Relic’s software engineering team is constantly pushing out improvements and new features to improve our customers’ overall monitoring experience. In order to take advantage of all the awesomeness they’re delivering, we recommend regularly updating to the latest version of the infrastructure agent. Want more user tips?

Read on to learn the best practices for: Policies Notification channels Incident preferences Thresholds and violations Muting rules Recommended alerts Use recommended alerts conditions conditions if you are new to Alerts or if you want suggestions that optimize your alert coverage. Organize your policies A policy is a container for similar conditions. If you’re new to Alerts, learn how to create, edit, or find policies. Organize your policy's scope to a single entity when possible. Assign your policy to the essential team or teams that need to be notified when an incident occurs. This way, you keep policies centralized and focused. If a team is monitoring several groups of the same entity type, combine those entity clusters (like servers) together into one policy. This way, your team can be notified from one policy rather than navigating several policies at once. You can use Alerts to monitor all of your entities. Consider your role and priorities when assigning yourself to a policy. For example: Software developers may need notifications for both front-end and back-end performance, such as webpage response time and page load JavaScript errors. Operations personnel may need notifications for poor back-end performance, such as server memory and load averages. The product owner may need notifications for positive front-end performance, such as improved end user Apdex scores or sales being monitored in dashboards. Set your condition thresholds and violations Set meaningful threshold levels to optimize Alerts for your business. Here are some suggested guidelines: Action Recommendations Set threshold levels Avoid setting thresholds too low. For example, if you set a CPU condition threshold of 75% for 5 minutes on your production servers, and it routinely goes over that level, this will increase the likelihood of un-actionable alerts or false positives. Experimenting with settings You do not need to edit files or restart software, so feel free to make quick changes to your threshold levels and adjust as necessary. Adjust settings Adjust your conditions over time. As you use our products to help you optimize your entity's performance, tighten your thresholds to keep pace with your improved performance. If you are rolling out something that you know will negatively impact your performance for a period of time, loosen your thresholds to allow for this. Disable settings You can disable any condition in a policy. This is useful, for example, if you want to continue using other conditions in the policy while you experiment with other metrics or thresholds. In most of our products (except Infrastructure), the color-coded health status indicator in the user interface changes as the alerting threshold escalates or returns to normal. This allows you to monitor a situation through our UI before a critical threshold passes, without needing to receive specific notifications about it. There are two violation thresholds: critical (red) and warning (yellow). Define these thresholds with different criteria, keeping in mind the suggestions above. Important Warning violations do not open incidents. A critical violation can open incidents, but you must define that decision through your incident preferences. Decide what happens when there's no signal Loss of signal occurs when New Relic stops receiving data for a while; technically, we detect loss of signal after a significant amount of time has elapsed since data was last received in a time series. Loss of signal can be used to trigger or resolve a violation, which you can use to set up alerts. You can configure loss of signal settings by condition in the UI or configure loss of signal via the NerdGraph API. Use non-null values when there's no signal By default, gaps in data signals are filled with null values. In cases where you need to be able to create conditions based on those data gaps, you can fill gaps with a custom value or the last known value. You can configure this setting by condition in the UI or configure gap filling values via NerdGraph Define your incident preferences Decide when you get incident notifications so you can respond to incidents when they happen. If you’re new to Alerts, learn more about your incident preferences options. The default incident preference setting combines all conditions within a policy into one incident. Change your default incident preference setting to increase or decrease the number of incidents and incident notifications you receive. Each team within your organization will have different needs. Ask your team two important questions when deciding your incident preferences: Do we want to be notified every time something goes wrong? Do we want to group all similar notifications together and be notified once? When a policy and its conditions have a broader scope (like managing the performance of several entities), increase the amount of incidents you receive. You will need more notifications because two incidents will not necessarily relate to each other. When a policy and its conditions have a focused scope (like managing the performance of one entity), opt for the default incident preference. You will need less notifications when two incidents are related to each other or when the team is already notified and fixing an existing problem. Decide how you get incident notifications by using our notification channel best practices. Select your notification channels Tailor notifications to the most useful channel and policy so you can avoid alert fatigue and help the right personnel receive and respond to incidents they care about in a systematic way. If you’re new to Alerts, learn how to set up notification channels. Notify teams and individuals who needs to stay updated on or resolve a problem when an incident arises. To stay updated, select a notification channel that is less intrusive, like email. For vital notifications and incident responses, select a notification channel that is more intrusive, like PagerDuty or Slack. Do not rely on email for quick notifications in case of delays. Understand muting rules Mute alerts during routine events, such as maintenance or planned downtime. You can also silence a policy, a specific entity, and a condition when needed. Incidents can still be opened, but you won't be notified. If you're new to Alerts, learn how to create and manage muting rules. What's next? To learn more about using alerts: Learn about the API.

      "body": "As you migrate your applications to the cloud, you want to catch and correct any unexpected behavior or outcomes as soon as possible. Detecting errors and issues related to your new cloud architecture, performance, and scale is critical—getting the right information at the right time can be the difference between success and failure. 1. Identify components Create a list all of applications, services, and their underlying server infrastructures in your application portfolio that you want to migrate to the cloud. 2. Identify KPIs To provide quantifiable measures that your teams can use to assess your migration, identify a list of corporate KPIs (key performance indicators). Using the New Relic platform to measure KPIs helps you eliminate blindspots and see the connections between entities—from your application code, to your cloud infrastructure (including containers running in highly distributed microservices), to your customer experience. Your goal is to create a collection of metrics in several categories that you can visualize in our Dashboards. To validate cloud improvements, group KPIs in the following categories, from least to most strong: Application and infrastructure performance End-user experience, including website and mobile application performance Audience and content trends DevOps productivity Application revenue analytics Future business goals 3. Deploy monitoring tools To start monitoring your KPIs, verify that the applications that you want to migrate are compatible with the requirements for the New Relic products you will use. Then, install the New Relic agents: Deploy APM Review the compatibility and requirements and then install APM agents on your application stack. After installing the APM agents, review the architecture of the applications that you instrumented with an APM agent. Take note of all hosts that are part of each tier of the application stack (database, application, web server, etc.), so you can install infrastructure monitoring agents on each of those hosts. Deploy browser monitoring In a nutshell, browser monitoring is a snippet of JavaScript that needs to appear in all of your application's webpages. It has no dependencies on other libraries, so it does not cause additional delays when bringing jQuery or other frameworks into the webpage. There are three ways to install the browser agent: Method When to use this method Enable via APM Typically, the quickest path is to let the APM agent dynamically inject the snippet into your pages on the server side. This works for many common web technologies, such as .NET, JSP, and other Java solutions. The documentation provides a complete reference for the languages and frameworks that allow this option. Copy/paste method If you are using an unsupported framework or are in an environment where you can instrument only the webpages but cannot install APM on the backend, use the copy-paste method. The UI generates a simple JavaScript snippet. Copy that snippet, and paste it into a global page template on your end to get browser monitoring deployed across your site. Enable via the API You can perform a manual instrumentation, in which your developers add instrumentation to your webpages using a server-side API. New Relic supports this for many server-side languages. Refer to the documentation for an example of how to do this in Java. Deploy New Relic Infrastructure After reviewing the requirements for New Relic Infrastructure, install the Infrastructure agent on the hosts that you identified so you can start to gather data for your KPIs. Tip If you use Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for automation, you can use those tools to deploy Infrastructure agents to your hosts. Set up alerts New Relic Alerts is a single integrated solution with a centralized UI to help you focus on the metrics that you care about most. When you set up New Relic Alerts and NRQL alerting, you establish flexible policies and conditions to receive alerts and notifications on multiple channels (email, Slack, OpsGenie, etc.). For more detailed information about creating, managing, and using alerts, check out the New Relic University tutorials. 4. Set up cloud integrations Tip Cloud-based integrations available through New Relic include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. Once your applications are migrated to the cloud and you start to integrate new cloud services, you can use New Relic to monitor and report data about your cloud services, offering you a comprehensive view of your entire architecture in one place. For example, to capture and record AWS account activity for audit and governance purposes, use the New Relic AWS CloudTrail integration. Tracking error events gives you awareness about API calls and services that have failed, while console logins help you monitor console activity and potential intrusion attempts. New Relic collects this event data so you can display it in a Dashboard or alert on it with NRQL. To gain extended visibility into applications that your code depends on, you can also deploy on-host integrations for commonly used application components, such as MySQL, Apache, and NGINX. In addition, you can create your own custom on-host integration with the New Relic Integrations SDK. 5. Identify issues and roadblocks Once your applications are running in the cloud, they may generate new types of errors that are different from the errors that they generated when running on-premise. You can use New Relic APM and browser monitoring to view error events, error metrics, and detailed error traces for your applications. If an error or unhandled exception happens, the data appears on the JavaScript errors page and the APM Error analytics page. From these pages, you can quickly troubleshoot runtime errors. Then, further analyze errors by grouping them according to attributes, by filtering them, or by searching for keywords in the event data. Each unhandled exception generates a transaction error event in Insights, and the dashboards are updated in real-time. Event data is a record of a single event at a particular moment in time and consists of default attributes, like a timestamp, and an event type. You can also add custom attributes to provide more context. Tip Once you start capturing JavaScript errors as events in Insights, set up NRQL alerting so you can stay on top of your error data. Use the JavaScript errors page to get visibility into real-time user experience: one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors: Use the charts on this page to get visibility into the real-time user experience. Then, create a Dashboard that covers a longer period of time and aligns the error and unhandled exception data with your KPIs: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > Create a dashboard: Use dashboards to align the error and unhandled exception data with your KPIs. Expert tip for alerting on JavaScript errors To get notifications for error spikes that are different from known or common JavaScript errors, use the following NRQL query for browser-monitored: SELECT count(*) FROM JavaScriptError WHERE appName = '<BrowserAppName>' AND errorClass NOT IN ('<ErrorClass1>','<ErrorClass2>') Copy Replace <BrowserAppName> with the browser app name that you want to monitor with this alert. Replace <ErrorClass1> and <ErrorClass2> with the on-premise error class names that you do not want New Relic to alert you about. Set the threshold based on your alerting needs. Using this query, New Relic alerts you every time a JavaScript error occurs when it has an error class that is not normally reported.",

      "body": "When you are planning a migration to the cloud, it is important to analyze your current on-premise architecture and identify the scope of your migration. When you have a full understanding of your applications, your hosts, and their architecture, you reduce the possibility of missing dependencies during your migration. 1. Identify applications and components First, you need to determine the level of instrumentation that is possible or allowed within your organization. The deeper you instrument, the more visibility you gain into your applications. Then, address the scope of your cloud migration by answering the following questions and keeping track of your answers: What applications do I need to include in the migration? What are the dependencies of each application? What are the underlying services/inventory supporting these applications? 2. Install New Relic agents Based on your answers when you determined the scope of your cloud migration, verify that the applications that you want to migrate are compatible with New Relic products and install the agents: APM APM delivers data about your application's performance, providing information about app availability and external services so you can visualize your application dependencies. Confirm that your system meets the requirements for the APM agents that you want to install, and then install the APM agent on your application stack. Steps for installing APM agents vary based on language. Infrastructure Infrastructure monitoring provides flexible, dynamic server monitoring so you can inventory your hosts and their configuration settings. Confirm that your underlying infrastructure meets the requirements for infrastructure. Install the infrastructure agent on instances that host your applications. Infrastructure on-host integrations Infrastructure on-host integrations monitor the services that your code depends on. Install the on-host integrations for the services that you are using. 3. Visualize application dependencies with APM After you install the APM agent, use service maps to get a full view of your application’s architecture. Service maps allow you to identify any connections from applications to external services, web services, databases, or APIs. After creating a service map for the application that has dependencies that you want to explore, add an application node on the map. Then, begin to add connections to the map including databases, external services, third-party APIs, and even browser-monitored applications. New Relic pulls every node you add into the map, and you can watch the shape of your architecture emerge. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Service map: View a service map to see a visual overview of your system architecture and the health of entities. Based on the visibility into internal and external dependencies that the service map provides, you can create a migration plan that includes all aspects of an application’s ecosystem. 4. Inventory underlining instances with Infrastructure New Relic Infrastructure's inventory page gives you visibility into the software packages installed on your servers. Essentially, the inventory page displays detailed information about a system’s per-host configuration, including details about system modules, configuration files, metadata, packages, services, and user sessions. The inventory page provides a real-time, filterable, searchable view into each host’s configuration. The inventory page not only provides you with the list of packages installed but also provides version information as well. Use this version information to know which packages to upgrade and which packages to replicate for your cloud migration. It also helps you track the dependencies between the software packages and configuration files. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Inventory: View the inventory page for details about your hosts and their configurations. You can also use the Inventory page to get a sense of what software or packages you no longer need, which is a great way to “clean up” your servers before you migrate to the cloud. 5. Uncover unknown applications and components Since anything can happen during an application’s lifecycle, like an application changing ownership, you may come across applications or component dependencies that you did not know about. If you discover any unknown dependencies, assess their relationship to other applications and components in your infrastructure to determine if they should be pulled into your migration plan. If you discover any applications or components while viewing service maps or while reviewing the inventory page, remember to instrument them before you migrate them. 6. Resolve errors or other issues After you instrument your applications, APM may uncover errors or issues with your current on-prem applications. Use APM error analytics to determine the root cause of any errors or issues in your applications. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors: Use error analytics to determine the root cause of errors in your applications. Start with the Error rate chart to see if there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or error patterns. Correlate any patterns on the Top 5 errors chart to alerts occurring during the same time period. The Error traces table includes specific stack trace details, such as associated host, user, framework code, and custom attributes to help you identify the root cause of an error. 7. Create Dashboards In addition to the application baselines you built, create dashboards to assess your on-premises applications in preparation for migrating them to the cloud. Use Dashboards to gain visibility into the average response times, the top transactions, the associated average duration, and the overall CPU usage for your instrumented application. Drill down into individual applications to see your top processes and the CPU percent for each process. You can also view an error analysis for a set of instrumented applications: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > (select a dashboard): View errors visualize issues with your applications. Check out the best practices guide for tips on creating and utilizing dashboards. Sharing New Relic Dashboards with your teams and stakeholders is a powerful way to communicate the impact of your migration during your cloud adoption process. Expert tip for reporting custom data Utilizing service maps, errors, and inventory management gives you a critical look at the architecture of your applications and their dependencies. If you find that you need data that is not available by default, New Relic products allow you to capture custom data: APM Browser Infrastructure Dashboards Mobile Synthetics",

Tip If you are using AWS as a cloud provider, take advantage of New Relic’s AWS billing integrations to stay on top of your budget and prove the success of your migration. 3. Gather custom data To manage, search for, and filter resources, assign metadata to your cloud resources in the form of tags. Tags are labels that consist of key-value pairs that you use to annotate your Infrastructure data. Tag formats are different between AWS, Azure, and Google. Google, for example, has the shortest allowable lengths for keys and values. In addition, they all have different requirements for case sensitivity and allowable characters. To make sure that your tags are usable across most cloud providers: Use only lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes. Keep keys and values under 63 characters. New Relic reports data contained in specific events to your account as part of its “out-of-the-box” functionality. You can add additional data to those events by using custom attributes. If you determine that you need to collect custom data, review custom data requirements, and report custom event data. For more detailed information about sending custom data, check out these New Relic University tutorials: APM custom data overview Adding custom events using the API 4. Create baselines In order to validate the value of moving to the cloud, you need to get baselines for your applications before you move to the cloud. Define pre-migration baselines for applications and their underlying infrastructures that you have designated for cloud service improvements based on your KPIs. To stay on top of your KPIs as you are moving, create baseline alerts for applications monitored by APM and browser and use NRQL alerts to get notified on any spikes or drops in your KPIs. The following dashboard tracks key performance indicators for applications designated to move to the cloud: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > Create a dashboard: Create dashboards to track your KPIs. After you migrate applications to the cloud, apply the same criteria to post-migration baselines so you can compare your results from before and after your migration. 5.

      "body": "As you migrate your applications to the cloud, you want to catch and correct any unexpected behavior or outcomes as soon as possible. Detecting errors and issues related to your new cloud architecture, performance, and scale is critical—getting the right information at the right time can be the difference between success and failure. 1. Identify components Create a list all of applications, services, and their underlying server infrastructures in your application portfolio that you want to migrate to the cloud. 2. Identify KPIs To provide quantifiable measures that your teams can use to assess your migration, identify a list of corporate KPIs (key performance indicators). Using the New Relic platform to measure KPIs helps you eliminate blindspots and see the connections between entities—from your application code, to your cloud infrastructure (including containers running in highly distributed microservices), to your customer experience. Your goal is to create a collection of metrics in several categories that you can visualize in our Dashboards. To validate cloud improvements, group KPIs in the following categories, from least to most strong: Application and infrastructure performance End-user experience, including website and mobile application performance Audience and content trends DevOps productivity Application revenue analytics Future business goals 3. Deploy monitoring tools To start monitoring your KPIs, verify that the applications that you want to migrate are compatible with the requirements for the New Relic products you will use. Then, install the New Relic agents: Deploy APM Review the compatibility and requirements and then install APM agents on your application stack. After installing the APM agents, review the architecture of the applications that you instrumented with an APM agent. Take note of all hosts that are part of each tier of the application stack (database, application, web server, etc.), so you can install infrastructure monitoring agents on each of those hosts. Deploy browser monitoring In a nutshell, browser monitoring is a snippet of JavaScript that needs to appear in all of your application's webpages. It has no dependencies on other libraries, so it does not cause additional delays when bringing jQuery or other frameworks into the webpage. There are three ways to install the browser agent: Method When to use this method Enable via APM Typically, the quickest path is to let the APM agent dynamically inject the snippet into your pages on the server side. This works for many common web technologies, such as .NET, JSP, and other Java solutions. The documentation provides a complete reference for the languages and frameworks that allow this option. Copy/paste method If you are using an unsupported framework or are in an environment where you can instrument only the webpages but cannot install APM on the backend, use the copy-paste method. The UI generates a simple JavaScript snippet. Copy that snippet, and paste it into a global page template on your end to get browser monitoring deployed across your site. Enable via the API You can perform a manual instrumentation, in which your developers add instrumentation to your webpages using a server-side API. New Relic supports this for many server-side languages. Refer to the documentation for an example of how to do this in Java. Deploy New Relic Infrastructure After reviewing the requirements for New Relic Infrastructure, install the Infrastructure agent on the hosts that you identified so you can start to gather data for your KPIs. Tip If you use Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for automation, you can use those tools to deploy Infrastructure agents to your hosts. Set up alerts New Relic Alerts is a single integrated solution with a centralized UI to help you focus on the metrics that you care about most. When you set up New Relic Alerts and NRQL alerting, you establish flexible policies and conditions to receive alerts and notifications on multiple channels (email, Slack, OpsGenie, etc.). For more detailed information about creating, managing, and using alerts, check out the New Relic University tutorials. 4. Set up cloud integrations Tip Cloud-based integrations available through New Relic include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. Once your applications are migrated to the cloud and you start to integrate new cloud services, you can use New Relic to monitor and report data about your cloud services, offering you a comprehensive view of your entire architecture in one place. For example, to capture and record AWS account activity for audit and governance purposes, use the New Relic AWS CloudTrail integration. Tracking error events gives you awareness about API calls and services that have failed, while console logins help you monitor console activity and potential intrusion attempts. New Relic collects this event data so you can display it in a Dashboard or alert on it with NRQL. To gain extended visibility into applications that your code depends on, you can also deploy on-host integrations for commonly used application components, such as MySQL, Apache, and NGINX. In addition, you can create your own custom on-host integration with the New Relic Integrations SDK. 5. Identify issues and roadblocks Once your applications are running in the cloud, they may generate new types of errors that are different from the errors that they generated when running on-premise. You can use New Relic APM and browser monitoring to view error events, error metrics, and detailed error traces for your applications. If an error or unhandled exception happens, the data appears on the JavaScript errors page and the APM Error analytics page. From these pages, you can quickly troubleshoot runtime errors. Then, further analyze errors by grouping them according to attributes, by filtering them, or by searching for keywords in the event data. Each unhandled exception generates a transaction error event in Insights, and the dashboards are updated in real-time. Event data is a record of a single event at a particular moment in time and consists of default attributes, like a timestamp, and an event type. You can also add custom attributes to provide more context. Tip Once you start capturing JavaScript errors as events in Insights, set up NRQL alerting so you can stay on top of your error data. Use the JavaScript errors page to get visibility into real-time user experience: one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors: Use the charts on this page to get visibility into the real-time user experience. Then, create a Dashboard that covers a longer period of time and aligns the error and unhandled exception data with your KPIs: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > Create a dashboard: Use dashboards to align the error and unhandled exception data with your KPIs. Expert tip for alerting on JavaScript errors To get notifications for error spikes that are different from known or common JavaScript errors, use the following NRQL query for browser-monitored: SELECT count(*) FROM JavaScriptError WHERE appName = '<BrowserAppName>' AND errorClass NOT IN ('<ErrorClass1>','<ErrorClass2>') Copy Replace <BrowserAppName> with the browser app name that you want to monitor with this alert. Replace <ErrorClass1> and <ErrorClass2> with the on-premise error class names that you do not want New Relic to alert you about. Set the threshold based on your alerting needs. Using this query, New Relic alerts you every time a JavaScript error occurs when it has an error class that is not normally reported.",

      "body": "When you are planning a migration to the cloud, it is important to analyze your current on-premise architecture and identify the scope of your migration. When you have a full understanding of your applications, your hosts, and their architecture, you reduce the possibility of missing dependencies during your migration. 1. Identify applications and components First, you need to determine the level of instrumentation that is possible or allowed within your organization. The deeper you instrument, the more visibility you gain into your applications. Then, address the scope of your cloud migration by answering the following questions and keeping track of your answers: What applications do I need to include in the migration? What are the dependencies of each application? What are the underlying services/inventory supporting these applications? 2. Install New Relic agents Based on your answers when you determined the scope of your cloud migration, verify that the applications that you want to migrate are compatible with New Relic products and install the agents: APM APM delivers data about your application's performance, providing information about app availability and external services so you can visualize your application dependencies. Confirm that your system meets the requirements for the APM agents that you want to install, and then install the APM agent on your application stack. Steps for installing APM agents vary based on language. Infrastructure Infrastructure monitoring provides flexible, dynamic server monitoring so you can inventory your hosts and their configuration settings. Confirm that your underlying infrastructure meets the requirements for infrastructure. Install the infrastructure agent on instances that host your applications. Infrastructure on-host integrations Infrastructure on-host integrations monitor the services that your code depends on. Install the on-host integrations for the services that you are using. 3. Visualize application dependencies with APM After you install the APM agent, use service maps to get a full view of your application’s architecture. Service maps allow you to identify any connections from applications to external services, web services, databases, or APIs. After creating a service map for the application that has dependencies that you want to explore, add an application node on the map. Then, begin to add connections to the map including databases, external services, third-party APIs, and even browser-monitored applications. New Relic pulls every node you add into the map, and you can watch the shape of your architecture emerge. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Service map: View a service map to see a visual overview of your system architecture and the health of entities. Based on the visibility into internal and external dependencies that the service map provides, you can create a migration plan that includes all aspects of an application’s ecosystem. 4. Inventory underlining instances with Infrastructure New Relic Infrastructure's inventory page gives you visibility into the software packages installed on your servers. Essentially, the inventory page displays detailed information about a system’s per-host configuration, including details about system modules, configuration files, metadata, packages, services, and user sessions. The inventory page provides a real-time, filterable, searchable view into each host’s configuration. The inventory page not only provides you with the list of packages installed but also provides version information as well. Use this version information to know which packages to upgrade and which packages to replicate for your cloud migration. It also helps you track the dependencies between the software packages and configuration files. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Inventory: View the inventory page for details about your hosts and their configurations. You can also use the Inventory page to get a sense of what software or packages you no longer need, which is a great way to “clean up” your servers before you migrate to the cloud. 5. Uncover unknown applications and components Since anything can happen during an application’s lifecycle, like an application changing ownership, you may come across applications or component dependencies that you did not know about. If you discover any unknown dependencies, assess their relationship to other applications and components in your infrastructure to determine if they should be pulled into your migration plan. If you discover any applications or components while viewing service maps or while reviewing the inventory page, remember to instrument them before you migrate them. 6. Resolve errors or other issues After you instrument your applications, APM may uncover errors or issues with your current on-prem applications. Use APM error analytics to determine the root cause of any errors or issues in your applications. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors: Use error analytics to determine the root cause of errors in your applications. Start with the Error rate chart to see if there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or error patterns. Correlate any patterns on the Top 5 errors chart to alerts occurring during the same time period. The Error traces table includes specific stack trace details, such as associated host, user, framework code, and custom attributes to help you identify the root cause of an error. 7. Create Dashboards In addition to the application baselines you built, create dashboards to assess your on-premises applications in preparation for migrating them to the cloud. Use Dashboards to gain visibility into the average response times, the top transactions, the associated average duration, and the overall CPU usage for your instrumented application. Drill down into individual applications to see your top processes and the CPU percent for each process. You can also view an error analysis for a set of instrumented applications: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > (select a dashboard): View errors visualize issues with your applications. Check out the best practices guide for tips on creating and utilizing dashboards. Sharing New Relic Dashboards with your teams and stakeholders is a powerful way to communicate the impact of your migration during your cloud adoption process.

      "body": "Successfully scaling DevOps requires a robust understanding of dependencies across application teams and related services. Use New Relics service maps to discover and mitigate risky dependencies from upstream and downstream services. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you’ve completed the previous DevOps procedures. 1. Analyze dependencies with service maps Use service maps for each application and note any dependent systems and transactions. New Relic recommends that you start by viewing the entire architecture using the Discover your environment option. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list This initial view shows all applications that are configured in your account. Applications that have violated a warning threshold are shown in yellow, and those with an active alert are shown in red. Healthy applications appear in green. New Relic uses a bold line to map applications to the services (such as databases) they connect to. Familiarize yourself with these maps to see how applications and their services fit together. Take note of which applications have the most dependencies and which rely on the same dependency, such as an API. Click an application to see high level metrics about that app, including throughput, response time, Apdex score, and error rate for the last 30 minutes. Tracking throughput is a good way to determine which of your applications are serving the most traffic. After looking at the architecture as a whole, review the applications that have the most dependencies. Select the App/Services list to see a full list of your applications. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list In this example, we’ve chosen Tower-Chicago from the App/Services list. All of the traffic being sent to Tower-Chicago is coming from Proxy-East. In this case, Tower-Chicago is showing 48.3 requests per minute, or 11.3% of the 426 requests per minute flowing through Proxy-East. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list In most cases, the separate applications and services represented in service maps are created and maintained by separate teams. This exercise of walking through the dependencies of your architecture should involve representatives from each of those teams. Teams should work together to ask questions such as: How critical is this particular dependency? What would happen if it were to go down? What happened last time it went down? Was there a revenue loss? 2. Identify back-end application dependency risks Once you’ve analyzed your applications’ dependencies, you’ll want to examine the quality of dependency execution. For example, is the dependency stable and predictable for each application or transaction you’ve identified? To do this, you’ll first need to gather as much information as you can about the applications from New Relic Insights, which helps you analyze data that is collected about the applications in more detail. Here is an example NRQL query to further analyze back-end service performance: SELECT count(appName)/30 as 'Throughput', apdex(duration), average(duration), stddev(duration), max(duration), count(error_type), uniquecount(host) FROM Transaction FACET appName SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO Copy This query shows you each application’s request per minute (throughput), Apdex score, and an overview of how the application is performing overall (through the standard deviation calculation, in which lower numbers are generally better). It also shows errors for the time period and the number of hosts on which the application is running. insights.newrelic.com > query results Next, gather information on incidents and events related to the services from New Relic Alerts: Click Alerts > Incidents > All Incidents. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents > All Incidents Click Alerts > Events > All Events. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents > All Events Tip Using webhooks to send alert events to New Relic Insights, allows you to supplement your dashboards with Alerts data. The process is outlined in this community discussion post. Here is a simplified example of the results of this exercise: Application Number of dependencies RPM Hosts APDEX (avg) Last outage TTR (hrs) Routing Service 10 983 4 .93 2/19/18 .75 Tower Austin 1 58 1 .95 10/11/17 1.5 Proxy-East 11 498 4 .92 1/4/18 .25 Proxy-West 11 495 4 .97 12/3/17 .25 WebPortal 7 396 8 .98 4/1/18 2.5 Supplement this data with the data that your teams know about your service and that you gathered from the dependency exercise in step 1, and use that data to develop hypotheses about the highest risk areas in your services that should be mitigated. 3. Identify front-end dependency risk Once you’ve analyzed back-end dependencies, explore front-end dependencies. This is a critical step because as you walk higher up the stack and closer to the user, you will likely have more dependencies and abstractions. Service maps seamlessly integrate data from browser monitoring and mobile monitoring to help you understand the dependencies from front-end user interfaces to back-end services. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps Use the service map view to drill into front-end dependencies, and execute a similar exercise to the one you executed for back-end dependencies. This exercise will again expose data to help you identify risk areas you should address and optimize. We recommend that you conduct the analysis with user interface (UI) teams so that you can also gather a complementary qualitative understanding of what the UI teams consider critical based on their experience. A ranking from the UI teams of the most critical dependency is a useful output of this work. 4. Identify Microservice Dependencies If you are using microservices, you can have dozens, if not hundreds, of services that are calling each other. Use Distributed Tracing to see how all those services connect together and how your requests flow through those different services. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. A distributed trace is composed of multiple \"spans,\" which represent time spent in services or resources of those services. Click on the Distributed tracing menu in APM left nav. You can see “trace listing” view where you’ll be able to quickly identify slow traces and traces with errors. The scatter plot lets you easily see outliers. Below that are the trace summaries, click on a trace to see details. Dive into distributed traces to see how long each span takes. Click into each span to see historical performance charts and associated attributes that layer in the context you need to understand and troubleshoot issues. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Distributed tracing This rounds out your list of dependencies. 5. Create an action plan for risk mitigation Once you’ve analyzed the dependencies across your application from both front-end and back-end services, create an action plan to reduce dependency risks and achieve your service level objectives (SLO). As you prioritize these next steps, we recommend you keep these four principles in mind: Understand your risk tolerance. It’s helpful to have a clear picture of your tolerance for risk, which ideally should be informed by your service level objectives (refer to the Establish Objectives and Baselines tutorial for more information). Set an alert policy to monitor dependencies that you’ve determined have a high relationship to SLO achievement. Minimize dependencies. The simpler you keep your code, the less functions you'll have referring to other modules. Removing unnecessary complexity is an important way to ensure you have a maintainable system that meets your customers’ expectations. Localize dependencies. For the code you write, package together functions that depend on each other whenever possible. Stabilize dependencies. When dependencies are unavoidable, mitigate risks by ensuring these dependencies point to modules that are the least likely to change or are easier to substitute. When your action plan is complete, monitor the results of the efforts. The efficacy of your actions to resolve dependency risks should ultimately be measured by your SLOs",

      "body": "Incident orchestration is the alignment of teams, tools, and processes to prepare for incidents and outages in your software. The goal is to provide your teams a predictable framework and process to: Maximize efficiency in communication and effort. Minimize the overall impact to your business. Prerequisites Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete these New Relic tutorials: Establish team dashboards Set up proactive alerting 1. Assign first responders to team dashboards Recommendation: For each team dashboard, make sure: It has an owner who assumes responsibility for the health of the applications and features it monitors. There is no ambiguity about who is responsible for attending to and resolving an alert condition. This policy will vary between organizations depending on size, structure, and culture. For example, some teams may prefer to assign dashboards and alerts based on de-facto features or application ownership. Other teams may prefer to adopt an on-call rotation (often referred to as \"pager duty\"). In on-call rotations, designated team members handle all first-line incident responses, and they resolve or delegate responsibilities based on predetermined incident thresholds. 2. Determine incident thresholds for alert conditions For each of your applications: Identify the thresholds for what is officially considered an incident. As you create alert policies with New Relic Alerts, make sure each set of threshold criteria is context-dependent. Document incident evaluation and known remediation procedures in runbooks. Include links to your runbooks when you define conditions and thresholds for your alert policies. For instance, a certain alert condition may be dismissable during low-traffic periods but require active remediation during peak hours. 3. Ensure alerts have auditable notification channels Recommendation: Make sure that communications during critical incidents take place in easily accessible and highly visible channels. A group chat room dedicated to incident communication is usually a great choice. This allows all stakeholders to participate or observe and provides a chronology of notifications, key decisions, and actions for postmortem analysis. Use any of the available notification channels in New Relic Alerts. For example, to set up a notification channel in Slack: Make sure your organization has completed New Relic's integration requirements with Slack. In the Slack app, select the dropdown in the top-left corner of the app, and select Customize Slack. Click Configure apps. From the list of app integrations, select New Relic. Expand the instructions for New Relic Alerts, and follow the steps to configure notifications from New Relic. 4. Automate triage and resolution steps Automation of simple or repeatable incident response tasks will increase efficiency and minimize the impact of incidents. With proper automation in place, you can disable or isolate faulty application components as soon as an alert threshold is reached, rather than after a notification has been issued. For example, a team managing an application for a digital media company wants to be able to remove commenting abilities from the website if the system has errors. In this case, they could: Add an endpoint to their front-end web application that will toggle a feature flag enabling or disabling the UI components associated with posting comments on an article. Create an alert policy with a threshold set on the sustained error rate in the commenting service. Assign a webhook notification channel that will send a POST request to this endpoint, as well as to the standard team notification channels. In this scenario, errors in the commenting system will trigger the webhook and remove the commenting UI from the website. Users can still use core functionality of the site without seeing errors generated by the commenting service. The application will maintain a stable but degraded state, allowing the team to focus on recovery without the pressure of preventing users from accessing the site. You can also use webhooks to create issues and action items in ticketing systems that have REST APIs, such as Zendesk. Use New Relic Alerts to create a webhook notification channel, and customize the webhook payload as needed. New Relic also provides integrations for some common ticketing systems. You can use any of the available integrations to file tickets from APM.",

      "body": "Analyzing metrics collected by New Relic Infrastructure allows you to uncover opportunities to optimize your organization's operating environment, whether it is a physical datacenter or thousands of instances. Using too few resources in key areas can lead to errors or performance problems. Using too many resources can lead to unneeded costs. For example, you may find that you can redistribute application instances to hosts that have extra memory and CPU resources, and terminate or repurpose the hosts those instances came from. Use Infrastructure to ensure that your team is providing the right amount of compute power to meet customer expectations at appropriate costs. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you have reviewed New Relic's Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. 1. Evaluate your environment's current efficiency Use the Cluster Explorer to observe performance and dependencies across any Kubernetes environment, and to troubleshoot failures, bottlenecks, and other abnormal behavior—helping ensure that their applications are always available, running fast, and doing what they’re supposed to do. You get an overall view of the health of each cluster, and can drill down as needed for details on the state of a Kubernetes object, including a view of key metrics and logs. Start at the outer ring to view nodes of the cluster, with each node displaying CPU, memory, and storage performance metrics that provide at-a-glance understanding of the node’s overall health. Specify a lower and upper RAM and CPU limits for each container using requests and limits. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts: To evaluate your operating environment's efficiency, review the Infrastructure metrics (including averages that show as dotted lines), watch for outliers, and expand and sort the table's Memory used column. If you are using on-premise hosts (or Docker without Kubernetes), you can see the health of your hosts and containers in Infrastructure. Again, focus on CPU %, Load Average and Memory Used %. These metrics provide a good overview of your environment’s capacity. 2. Identify underutilized hosts and applications As you identify hosts that have extra capacity, start with memory usage, as that is a common limiting factor: From the Infrastructure Hosts page, expand [Expand icon] the table, then sort the Memory used column in descending order. To identify good redistribution candidates, look for hosts using a small amount of memory that have a small number of applications deployed on them. Also consider the health of an application before moving it to a different host. To ensure that an application has predictable performance, use APM. From the APM Overview page, track metrics for Apdex (user satisfaction) and average response time for transactions. Review other app performance details from the APM UI. Stabilize applications that are volatile before introducing other variables into their runtime performance. 3. Use the Cloud Optimize Nerdpack Cloud Optimize analyzes your cloud environment using the New Relic Infrastructure cloud integrations(for AWS, GCP, Azure and Alibaba). It compares the size of your instances to their utilization, identifying resources that are sized larger than needed. Cloud Optimize will estimate your savings by optimizing resource size.

The goal is to provide your teams a predictable framework and process to: Maximize efficiency in communication and effort. Minimize the overall impact to your business. Prerequisites Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete these New Relic tutorials: Establish team dashboards Set up proactive alerting 1. Assign first responders to team dashboards Recommendation: For each team dashboard, make sure: It has an owner who assumes responsibility for the health of the applications and features it monitors. There is no ambiguity about who is responsible for attending to and resolving an alert condition. This policy will vary between organizations depending on size, structure, and culture. For example, some teams may prefer to assign dashboards and alerts based on de-facto features or application ownership. Other teams may prefer to adopt an on-call rotation (often referred to as \"pager duty\"). In on-call rotations, designated team members handle all first-line incident responses, and they resolve or delegate responsibilities based on predetermined incident thresholds. 2. Determine incident thresholds for alert conditions For each of your applications: Identify the thresholds for what is officially considered an incident. As you create alert policies with New Relic Alerts, make sure each set of threshold criteria is context-dependent. Document incident evaluation and known remediation procedures in runbooks. Include links to your runbooks when you define conditions and thresholds for your alert policies. For instance, a certain alert condition may be dismissable during low-traffic periods but require active remediation during peak hours. 3. Ensure alerts have auditable notification channels Recommendation: Make sure that communications during critical incidents take place in easily accessible and highly visible channels. A group chat room dedicated to incident communication is usually a great choice. This allows all stakeholders to participate or observe and provides a chronology of notifications, key decisions, and actions for postmortem analysis. Use any of the available notification channels in New Relic Alerts. For example, to set up a notification channel in Slack: Make sure your organization has completed New Relic's integration requirements with Slack. In the Slack app, select the dropdown in the top-left corner of the app, and select Customize Slack. Click Configure apps. From the list of app integrations, select New Relic. Expand the instructions for New Relic Alerts, and follow the steps to configure notifications from New Relic. 4. Automate triage and resolution steps Automation of simple or repeatable incident response tasks will increase efficiency and minimize the impact of incidents. With proper automation in place, you can disable or isolate faulty application components as soon as an alert threshold is reached, rather than after a notification has been issued. For example, a team managing an application for a digital media company wants to be able to remove commenting abilities from the website if the system has errors. In this case, they could: Add an endpoint to their front-end web application that will toggle a feature flag enabling or disabling the UI components associated with posting comments on an article. Create an alert policy with a threshold set on the sustained error rate in the commenting service. Assign a webhook notification channel that will send a POST request to this endpoint, as well as to the standard team notification channels. In this scenario, errors in the commenting system will trigger the webhook and remove the commenting UI from the website. Users can still use core functionality of the site without seeing errors generated by the commenting service. The application will maintain a stable but degraded state, allowing the team to focus on recovery without the pressure of preventing users from accessing the site. You can also use webhooks to create issues and action items in ticketing systems that have REST APIs, such as Zendesk. Use New Relic Alerts to create a webhook notification channel, and customize the webhook payload as needed. New Relic also provides integrations for some common ticketing systems. You can use any of the available integrations to file tickets from APM.",

For example, you may find that you can redistribute application instances to hosts that have extra memory and CPU resources, and terminate or repurpose the hosts those instances came from. Use Infrastructure to ensure that your team is providing the right amount of compute power to meet customer expectations at appropriate costs. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you have reviewed New Relic's Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. 1. Evaluate your environment's current efficiency Use the Cluster Explorer to observe performance and dependencies across any Kubernetes environment, and to troubleshoot failures, bottlenecks, and other abnormal behavior—helping ensure that their applications are always available, running fast, and doing what they’re supposed to do. You get an overall view of the health of each cluster, and can drill down as needed for details on the state of a Kubernetes object, including a view of key metrics and logs. Start at the outer ring to view nodes of the cluster, with each node displaying CPU, memory, and storage performance metrics that provide at-a-glance understanding of the node’s overall health. Specify a lower and upper RAM and CPU limits for each container using requests and limits. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts: To evaluate your operating environment's efficiency, review the Infrastructure metrics (including averages that show as dotted lines), watch for outliers, and expand and sort the table's Memory used column. If you are using on-premise hosts (or Docker without Kubernetes), you can see the health of your hosts and containers in Infrastructure. Again, focus on CPU %, Load Average and Memory Used %. These metrics provide a good overview of your environment’s capacity. 2. Identify underutilized hosts and applications As you identify hosts that have extra capacity, start with memory usage, as that is a common limiting factor: From the Infrastructure Hosts page, expand [Expand icon] the table, then sort the Memory used column in descending order. To identify good redistribution candidates, look for hosts using a small amount of memory that have a small number of applications deployed on them. Also consider the health of an application before moving it to a different host. To ensure that an application has predictable performance, use APM. From the APM Overview page, track metrics for Apdex (user satisfaction) and average response time for transactions. Review other app performance details from the APM UI. Stabilize applications that are volatile before introducing other variables into their runtime performance. 3. Use the Cloud Optimize Nerdpack Cloud Optimize analyzes your cloud environment using the New Relic Infrastructure cloud integrations(for AWS, GCP, Azure and Alibaba). It compares the size of your instances to their utilization, identifying resources that are sized larger than needed. Cloud Optimize will estimate your savings by optimizing resource size.

      "body": "Successfully scaling DevOps requires a robust understanding of dependencies across application teams and related services. Use New Relics service maps to discover and mitigate risky dependencies from upstream and downstream services. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you’ve completed the previous DevOps procedures. 1. Analyze dependencies with service maps Use service maps for each application and note any dependent systems and transactions. New Relic recommends that you start by viewing the entire architecture using the Discover your environment option. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list This initial view shows all applications that are configured in your account. Applications that have violated a warning threshold are shown in yellow, and those with an active alert are shown in red. Healthy applications appear in green. New Relic uses a bold line to map applications to the services (such as databases) they connect to. Familiarize yourself with these maps to see how applications and their services fit together. Take note of which applications have the most dependencies and which rely on the same dependency, such as an API. Click an application to see high level metrics about that app, including throughput, response time, Apdex score, and error rate for the last 30 minutes. Tracking throughput is a good way to determine which of your applications are serving the most traffic. After looking at the architecture as a whole, review the applications that have the most dependencies. Select the App/Services list to see a full list of your applications. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list In this example, we’ve chosen Tower-Chicago from the App/Services list. All of the traffic being sent to Tower-Chicago is coming from Proxy-East. In this case, Tower-Chicago is showing 48.3 requests per minute, or 11.3% of the 426 requests per minute flowing through Proxy-East. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list In most cases, the separate applications and services represented in service maps are created and maintained by separate teams. This exercise of walking through the dependencies of your architecture should involve representatives from each of those teams. Teams should work together to ask questions such as: How critical is this particular dependency? What would happen if it were to go down? What happened last time it went down? Was there a revenue loss? 2. Identify back-end application dependency risks Once you’ve analyzed your applications’ dependencies, you’ll want to examine the quality of dependency execution. For example, is the dependency stable and predictable for each application or transaction you’ve identified? To do this, you’ll first need to gather as much information as you can about the applications from New Relic Insights, which helps you analyze data that is collected about the applications in more detail. Here is an example NRQL query to further analyze back-end service performance: SELECT count(appName)/30 as 'Throughput', apdex(duration), average(duration), stddev(duration), max(duration), count(error_type), uniquecount(host) FROM Transaction FACET appName SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO Copy This query shows you each application’s request per minute (throughput), Apdex score, and an overview of how the application is performing overall (through the standard deviation calculation, in which lower numbers are generally better). It also shows errors for the time period and the number of hosts on which the application is running. insights.newrelic.com > query results Next, gather information on incidents and events related to the services from New Relic Alerts: Click Alerts > Incidents > All Incidents. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents > All Incidents Click Alerts > Events > All Events. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents > All Events Tip Using webhooks to send alert events to New Relic Insights, allows you to supplement your dashboards with Alerts data. The process is outlined in this community discussion post. Here is a simplified example of the results of this exercise: Application Number of dependencies RPM Hosts APDEX (avg) Last outage TTR (hrs) Routing Service 10 983 4 .93 2/19/18 .75 Tower Austin 1 58 1 .95 10/11/17 1.5 Proxy-East 11 498 4 .92 1/4/18 .25 Proxy-West 11 495 4 .97 12/3/17 .25 WebPortal 7 396 8 .98 4/1/18 2.5 Supplement this data with the data that your teams know about your service and that you gathered from the dependency exercise in step 1, and use that data to develop hypotheses about the highest risk areas in your services that should be mitigated. 3. Identify front-end dependency risk Once you’ve analyzed back-end dependencies, explore front-end dependencies. This is a critical step because as you walk higher up the stack and closer to the user, you will likely have more dependencies and abstractions. Service maps seamlessly integrate data from browser monitoring and mobile monitoring to help you understand the dependencies from front-end user interfaces to back-end services. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps Use the service map view to drill into front-end dependencies, and execute a similar exercise to the one you executed for back-end dependencies. This exercise will again expose data to help you identify risk areas you should address and optimize. We recommend that you conduct the analysis with user interface (UI) teams so that you can also gather a complementary qualitative understanding of what the UI teams consider critical based on their experience. A ranking from the UI teams of the most critical dependency is a useful output of this work. 4. Identify Microservice Dependencies If you are using microservices, you can have dozens, if not hundreds, of services that are calling each other. Use Distributed Tracing to see how all those services connect together and how your requests flow through those different services. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. A distributed trace is composed of multiple \"spans,\" which represent time spent in services or resources of those services. Click on the Distributed tracing menu in APM left nav. You can see “trace listing” view where you’ll be able to quickly identify slow traces and traces with errors. The scatter plot lets you easily see outliers. Below that are the trace summaries, click on a trace to see details. Dive into distributed traces to see how long each span takes. Click into each span to see historical performance charts and associated attributes that layer in the context you need to understand and troubleshoot issues. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Distributed tracing This rounds out your list of dependencies. 5. Create an action plan for risk mitigation Once you’ve analyzed the dependencies across your application from both front-end and back-end services, create an action plan to reduce dependency risks and achieve your service level objectives (SLO). As you prioritize these next steps, we recommend you keep these four principles in mind: Understand your risk tolerance. It’s helpful to have a clear picture of your tolerance for risk, which ideally should be informed by your service level objectives (refer to the Establish Objectives and Baselines tutorial for more information). Set an alert policy to monitor dependencies that you’ve determined have a high relationship to SLO achievement. Minimize dependencies. The simpler you keep your code, the less functions you'll have referring to other modules. Removing unnecessary complexity is an important way to ensure you have a maintainable system that meets your customers’ expectations. Localize dependencies. For the code you write, package together functions that depend on each other whenever possible. Stabilize dependencies. When dependencies are unavoidable, mitigate risks by ensuring these dependencies point to modules that are the least likely to change or are easier to substitute. When your action plan is complete, monitor the results of the efforts. The efficacy of your actions to resolve dependency risks should ultimately be measured by your SLOs",

To identify good redistribution candidates, look for hosts using a small amount of memory that have a small number of applications deployed on them. Also consider the health of an application before moving it to a different host. To ensure that an application has predictable performance, use APM.

Use New Relics service maps to discover and mitigate risky dependencies from upstream and downstream services. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you’ve completed the previous DevOps procedures. 1. Analyze dependencies with service maps Use service maps for each application and note any dependent systems and transactions. New Relic recommends that you start by viewing the entire architecture using the Discover your environment option. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list This initial view shows all applications that are configured in your account. Applications that have violated a warning threshold are shown in yellow, and those with an active alert are shown in red. Healthy applications appear in green. New Relic uses a bold line to map applications to the services (such as databases) they connect to. Familiarize yourself with these maps to see how applications and their services fit together. Take note of which applications have the most dependencies and which rely on the same dependency, such as an API. Click an application to see high level metrics about that app, including throughput, response time, Apdex score, and error rate for the last 30 minutes. Tracking throughput is a good way to determine which of your applications are serving the most traffic. After looking at the architecture as a whole, review the applications that have the most dependencies. Select the App/Services list to see a full list of your applications. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list In this example, we’ve chosen Tower-Chicago from the App/Services list. All of the traffic being sent to Tower-Chicago is coming from Proxy-East. In this case, Tower-Chicago is showing 48.3 requests per minute, or 11.3% of the 426 requests per minute flowing through Proxy-East. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list In most cases, the separate applications and services represented in service maps are created and maintained by separate teams. This exercise of walking through the dependencies of your architecture should involve representatives from each of those teams. Teams should work together to ask questions such as: How critical is this particular dependency? What would happen if it were to go down? What happened last time it went down? Was there a revenue loss? 2. Identify back-end application dependency risks Once you’ve analyzed your applications’ dependencies, you’ll want to examine the quality of dependency execution. For example, is the dependency stable and predictable for each application or transaction you’ve identified? To do this, you’ll first need to gather as much information as you can about the applications from New Relic Insights, which helps you analyze data that is collected about the applications in more detail. Here is an example NRQL query to further analyze back-end service performance: SELECT count(appName)/30 as 'Throughput', apdex(duration), average(duration), stddev(duration), max(duration), count(error_type), uniquecount(host) FROM Transaction FACET appName SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO Copy This query shows you each application’s request per minute (throughput), Apdex score, and an overview of how the application is performing overall (through the standard deviation calculation, in which lower numbers are generally better). It also shows errors for the time period and the number of hosts on which the application is running. insights.newrelic.com > query results Next, gather information on incidents and events related to the services from New Relic Alerts: Click Alerts > Incidents > All Incidents. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents > All Incidents Click Alerts > Events > All Events. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents > All Events Tip Using webhooks to send alert events to New Relic Insights, allows you to supplement your dashboards with Alerts data. The process is outlined in this community discussion post. Here is a simplified example of the results of this exercise: Application Number of dependencies RPM Hosts APDEX (avg) Last outage TTR (hrs) Routing Service 10 983 4 .93 2/19/18 .75 Tower Austin 1 58 1 .95 10/11/17 1.5 Proxy-East 11 498 4 .92 1/4/18 .25 Proxy-West 11 495 4 .97 12/3/17 .25 WebPortal 7 396 8 .98 4/1/18 2.5 Supplement this data with the data that your teams know about your service and that you gathered from the dependency exercise in step 1, and use that data to develop hypotheses about the highest risk areas in your services that should be mitigated. 3. Identify front-end dependency risk Once you’ve analyzed back-end dependencies, explore front-end dependencies. This is a critical step because as you walk higher up the stack and closer to the user, you will likely have more dependencies and abstractions. Service maps seamlessly integrate data from browser monitoring and mobile monitoring to help you understand the dependencies from front-end user interfaces to back-end services. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps Use the service map view to drill into front-end dependencies, and execute a similar exercise to the one you executed for back-end dependencies. This exercise will again expose data to help you identify risk areas you should address and optimize. We recommend that you conduct the analysis with user interface (UI) teams so that you can also gather a complementary qualitative understanding of what the UI teams consider critical based on their experience. A ranking from the UI teams of the most critical dependency is a useful output of this work. 4. Identify Microservice Dependencies If you are using microservices, you can have dozens, if not hundreds, of services that are calling each other. Use Distributed Tracing to see how all those services connect together and how your requests flow through those different services. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. A distributed trace is composed of multiple \"spans,\" which represent time spent in services or resources of those services. Click on the Distributed tracing menu in APM left nav. You can see “trace listing” view where you’ll be able to quickly identify slow traces and traces with errors. The scatter plot lets you easily see outliers. Below that are the trace summaries, click on a trace to see details. Dive into distributed traces to see how long each span takes. Click into each span to see historical performance charts and associated attributes that layer in the context you need to understand and troubleshoot issues. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Distributed tracing This rounds out your list of dependencies. 5. Create an action plan for risk mitigation Once you’ve analyzed the dependencies across your application from both front-end and back-end services, create an action plan to reduce dependency risks and achieve your service level objectives (SLO). As you prioritize these next steps, we recommend you keep these four principles in mind: Understand your risk tolerance. It’s helpful to have a clear picture of your tolerance for risk, which ideally should be informed by your service level objectives (refer to the Establish Objectives and Baselines tutorial for more information). Set an alert policy to monitor dependencies that you’ve determined have a high relationship to SLO achievement. Minimize dependencies. The simpler you keep your code, the less functions you'll have referring to other modules. Removing unnecessary complexity is an important way to ensure you have a maintainable system that meets your customers’ expectations. Localize dependencies. For the code you write, package together functions that depend on each other whenever possible. Stabilize dependencies. When dependencies are unavoidable, mitigate risks by ensuring these dependencies point to modules that are the least likely to change or are easier to substitute. When your action plan is complete, monitor the results of the efforts. The efficacy of your actions to resolve dependency risks should ultimately be measured by your SLOs",

Using too few resources in key areas can lead to errors or performance problems. Using too many resources can lead to unneeded costs. For example, you may find that you can redistribute application instances to hosts that have extra memory and CPU resources, and terminate or repurpose the hosts those instances came from. Use Infrastructure to ensure that your team is providing the right amount of compute power to meet customer expectations at appropriate costs. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you have reviewed New Relic's Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. 1. Evaluate your environment's current efficiency Use the Cluster Explorer to observe performance and dependencies across any Kubernetes environment, and to troubleshoot failures, bottlenecks, and other abnormal behavior—helping ensure that their applications are always available, running fast, and doing what they’re supposed to do. You get an overall view of the health of each cluster, and can drill down as needed for details on the state of a Kubernetes object, including a view of key metrics and logs. Start at the outer ring to view nodes of the cluster, with each node displaying CPU, memory, and storage performance metrics that provide at-a-glance understanding of the node’s overall health. Specify a lower and upper RAM and CPU limits for each container using requests and limits. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts: To evaluate your operating environment's efficiency, review the Infrastructure metrics (including averages that show as dotted lines), watch for outliers, and expand and sort the table's Memory used column. If you are using on-premise hosts (or Docker without Kubernetes), you can see the health of your hosts and containers in Infrastructure. Again, focus on CPU %, Load Average and Memory Used %. These metrics provide a good overview of your environment’s capacity. 2. Identify underutilized hosts and applications As you identify hosts that have extra capacity, start with memory usage, as that is a common limiting factor: From the Infrastructure Hosts page, expand [Expand icon] the table, then sort the Memory used column in descending order.

      "body": "Incident orchestration is the alignment of teams, tools, and processes to prepare for incidents and outages in your software. The goal is to provide your teams a predictable framework and process to: Maximize efficiency in communication and effort. Minimize the overall impact to your business. Prerequisites Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete these New Relic tutorials: Establish team dashboards Set up proactive alerting 1. Assign first responders to team dashboards Recommendation: For each team dashboard, make sure: It has an owner who assumes responsibility for the health of the applications and features it monitors. There is no ambiguity about who is responsible for attending to and resolving an alert condition. This policy will vary between organizations depending on size, structure, and culture. For example, some teams may prefer to assign dashboards and alerts based on de-facto features or application ownership. Other teams may prefer to adopt an on-call rotation (often referred to as \"pager duty\"). In on-call rotations, designated team members handle all first-line incident responses, and they resolve or delegate responsibilities based on predetermined incident thresholds. 2. Determine incident thresholds for alert conditions For each of your applications: Identify the thresholds for what is officially considered an incident. As you create alert policies with New Relic Alerts, make sure each set of threshold criteria is context-dependent. Document incident evaluation and known remediation procedures in runbooks. Include links to your runbooks when you define conditions and thresholds for your alert policies. For instance, a certain alert condition may be dismissable during low-traffic periods but require active remediation during peak hours. 3. Ensure alerts have auditable notification channels Recommendation: Make sure that communications during critical incidents take place in easily accessible and highly visible channels. A group chat room dedicated to incident communication is usually a great choice. This allows all stakeholders to participate or observe and provides a chronology of notifications, key decisions, and actions for postmortem analysis. Use any of the available notification channels in New Relic Alerts. For example, to set up a notification channel in Slack: Make sure your organization has completed New Relic's integration requirements with Slack. In the Slack app, select the dropdown in the top-left corner of the app, and select Customize Slack. Click Configure apps. From the list of app integrations, select New Relic. Expand the instructions for New Relic Alerts, and follow the steps to configure notifications from New Relic. 4. Automate triage and resolution steps Automation of simple or repeatable incident response tasks will increase efficiency and minimize the impact of incidents. With proper automation in place, you can disable or isolate faulty application components as soon as an alert threshold is reached, rather than after a notification has been issued. For example, a team managing an application for a digital media company wants to be able to remove commenting abilities from the website if the system has errors. In this case, they could: Add an endpoint to their front-end web application that will toggle a feature flag enabling or disabling the UI components associated with posting comments on an article. Create an alert policy with a threshold set on the sustained error rate in the commenting service. Assign a webhook notification channel that will send a POST request to this endpoint, as well as to the standard team notification channels. In this scenario, errors in the commenting system will trigger the webhook and remove the commenting UI from the website. Users can still use core functionality of the site without seeing errors generated by the commenting service. The application will maintain a stable but degraded state, allowing the team to focus on recovery without the pressure of preventing users from accessing the site. You can also use webhooks to create issues and action items in ticketing systems that have REST APIs, such as Zendesk. Use New Relic Alerts to create a webhook notification channel, and customize the webhook payload as needed. New Relic also provides integrations for some common ticketing systems. You can use any of the available integrations to file tickets from APM.",

Create an action plan for risk mitigation Once you’ve analyzed the dependencies across your application from both front-end and back-end services, create an action plan to reduce dependency risks and achieve your service level objectives (SLO). As you prioritize these next steps, we recommend you keep these four principles in mind: Understand your risk tolerance. It’s helpful to have a clear picture of your tolerance for risk, which ideally should be informed by your service level objectives (refer to the Establish Objectives and Baselines tutorial for more information). Set an alert policy to monitor dependencies that you’ve determined have a high relationship to SLO achievement. Minimize dependencies. The simpler you keep your code, the less functions you'll have referring to other modules. Removing unnecessary complexity is an important way to ensure you have a maintainable system that meets your customers’ expectations. Localize dependencies. For the code you write, package together functions that depend on each other whenever possible. Stabilize dependencies. When dependencies are unavoidable, mitigate risks by ensuring these dependencies point to modules that are the least likely to change or are easier to substitute. When your action plan is complete, monitor the results of the efforts. The efficacy of your actions to resolve dependency risks should ultimately be measured by your SLOs",

Using too few resources in key areas can lead to errors or performance problems. Using too many resources can lead to unneeded costs. For example, you may find that you can redistribute application instances to hosts that have extra memory and CPU resources, and terminate or repurpose the hosts those instances came from. Use Infrastructure to ensure that your team is providing the right amount of compute power to meet customer expectations at appropriate costs. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you have reviewed New Relic's Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. 1. Evaluate your environment's current efficiency Use the Cluster Explorer to observe performance and dependencies across any Kubernetes environment, and to troubleshoot failures, bottlenecks, and other abnormal behavior—helping ensure that their applications are always available, running fast, and doing what they’re supposed to do. You get an overall view of the health of each cluster, and can drill down as needed for details on the state of a Kubernetes object, including a view of key metrics and logs. Start at the outer ring to view nodes of the cluster, with each node displaying CPU, memory, and storage performance metrics that provide at-a-glance understanding of the node’s overall health. Specify a lower and upper RAM and CPU limits for each container using requests and limits. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts: To evaluate your operating environment's efficiency, review the Infrastructure metrics (including averages that show as dotted lines), watch for outliers, and expand and sort the table's Memory used column. If you are using on-premise hosts (or Docker without Kubernetes), you can see the health of your hosts and containers in Infrastructure. Again, focus on CPU %, Load Average and Memory Used %. These metrics provide a good overview of your environment’s capacity. 2. Identify underutilized hosts and applications As you identify hosts that have extra capacity, start with memory usage, as that is a common limiting factor: From the Infrastructure Hosts page, expand [Expand icon] the table, then sort the Memory used column in descending order. To identify good redistribution candidates, look for hosts using a small amount of memory that have a small number of applications deployed on them. Also consider the health of an application before moving it to a different host. To ensure that an application has predictable performance, use APM. From the APM Overview page, track metrics for Apdex (user satisfaction) and average response time for transactions. Review other app performance details from the APM UI. Stabilize applications that are volatile before introducing other variables into their runtime performance. 3. Use the Cloud Optimize Nerdpack Cloud Optimize analyzes your cloud environment using the New Relic Infrastructure cloud integrations(for AWS, GCP, Azure and Alibaba). It compares the size of your instances to their utilization, identifying resources that are sized larger than needed. Cloud Optimize will estimate your savings by optimizing resource size. Installation details are on GitHub.",

      "body": "Incident orchestration is the alignment of teams, tools, and processes to prepare for incidents and outages in your software. The goal is to provide your teams a predictable framework and process to: Maximize efficiency in communication and effort. Minimize the overall impact to your business. Prerequisites Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete these New Relic tutorials: Establish team dashboards Set up proactive alerting 1. Assign first responders to team dashboards Recommendation: For each team dashboard, make sure: It has an owner who assumes responsibility for the health of the applications and features it monitors. There is no ambiguity about who is responsible for attending to and resolving an alert condition. This policy will vary between organizations depending on size, structure, and culture. For example, some teams may prefer to assign dashboards and alerts based on de-facto features or application ownership. Other teams may prefer to adopt an on-call rotation (often referred to as \"pager duty\"). In on-call rotations, designated team members handle all first-line incident responses, and they resolve or delegate responsibilities based on predetermined incident thresholds. 2. Determine incident thresholds for alert conditions For each of your applications: Identify the thresholds for what is officially considered an incident. As you create alert policies with New Relic Alerts, make sure each set of threshold criteria is context-dependent. Document incident evaluation and known remediation procedures in runbooks. Include links to your runbooks when you define conditions and thresholds for your alert policies. For instance, a certain alert condition may be dismissable during low-traffic periods but require active remediation during peak hours. 3. Ensure alerts have auditable notification channels Recommendation: Make sure that communications during critical incidents take place in easily accessible and highly visible channels. A group chat room dedicated to incident communication is usually a great choice. This allows all stakeholders to participate or observe and provides a chronology of notifications, key decisions, and actions for postmortem analysis. Use any of the available notification channels in New Relic Alerts. For example, to set up a notification channel in Slack: Make sure your organization has completed New Relic's integration requirements with Slack. In the Slack app, select the dropdown in the top-left corner of the app, and select Customize Slack. Click Configure apps. From the list of app integrations, select New Relic. Expand the instructions for New Relic Alerts, and follow the steps to configure notifications from New Relic. 4. Automate triage and resolution steps Automation of simple or repeatable incident response tasks will increase efficiency and minimize the impact of incidents. With proper automation in place, you can disable or isolate faulty application components as soon as an alert threshold is reached, rather than after a notification has been issued. For example, a team managing an application for a digital media company wants to be able to remove commenting abilities from the website if the system has errors. In this case, they could: Add an endpoint to their front-end web application that will toggle a feature flag enabling or disabling the UI components associated with posting comments on an article. Create an alert policy with a threshold set on the sustained error rate in the commenting service. Assign a webhook notification channel that will send a POST request to this endpoint, as well as to the standard team notification channels. In this scenario, errors in the commenting system will trigger the webhook and remove the commenting UI from the website. Users can still use core functionality of the site without seeing errors generated by the commenting service. The application will maintain a stable but degraded state, allowing the team to focus on recovery without the pressure of preventing users from accessing the site. You can also use webhooks to create issues and action items in ticketing systems that have REST APIs, such as Zendesk. Use New Relic Alerts to create a webhook notification channel, and customize the webhook payload as needed. New Relic also provides integrations for some common ticketing systems. You can use any of the available integrations to file tickets from APM.",

      "body": "Successfully scaling DevOps requires a robust understanding of dependencies across application teams and related services. Use New Relics service maps to discover and mitigate risky dependencies from upstream and downstream services. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you’ve completed the previous DevOps procedures. 1. Analyze dependencies with service maps Use service maps for each application and note any dependent systems and transactions. New Relic recommends that you start by viewing the entire architecture using the Discover your environment option. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list This initial view shows all applications that are configured in your account. Applications that have violated a warning threshold are shown in yellow, and those with an active alert are shown in red. Healthy applications appear in green. New Relic uses a bold line to map applications to the services (such as databases) they connect to. Familiarize yourself with these maps to see how applications and their services fit together. Take note of which applications have the most dependencies and which rely on the same dependency, such as an API. Click an application to see high level metrics about that app, including throughput, response time, Apdex score, and error rate for the last 30 minutes. Tracking throughput is a good way to determine which of your applications are serving the most traffic. After looking at the architecture as a whole, review the applications that have the most dependencies. Select the App/Services list to see a full list of your applications. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list In this example, we’ve chosen Tower-Chicago from the App/Services list. All of the traffic being sent to Tower-Chicago is coming from Proxy-East. In this case, Tower-Chicago is showing 48.3 requests per minute, or 11.3% of the 426 requests per minute flowing through Proxy-East. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list In most cases, the separate applications and services represented in service maps are created and maintained by separate teams. This exercise of walking through the dependencies of your architecture should involve representatives from each of those teams. Teams should work together to ask questions such as: How critical is this particular dependency? What would happen if it were to go down? What happened last time it went down? Was there a revenue loss? 2. Identify back-end application dependency risks Once you’ve analyzed your applications’ dependencies, you’ll want to examine the quality of dependency execution. For example, is the dependency stable and predictable for each application or transaction you’ve identified? To do this, you’ll first need to gather as much information as you can about the applications from New Relic Insights, which helps you analyze data that is collected about the applications in more detail. Here is an example NRQL query to further analyze back-end service performance: SELECT count(appName)/30 as 'Throughput', apdex(duration), average(duration), stddev(duration), max(duration), count(error_type), uniquecount(host) FROM Transaction FACET appName SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO Copy This query shows you each application’s request per minute (throughput), Apdex score, and an overview of how the application is performing overall (through the standard deviation calculation, in which lower numbers are generally better). It also shows errors for the time period and the number of hosts on which the application is running. insights.newrelic.com > query results Next, gather information on incidents and events related to the services from New Relic Alerts: Click Alerts > Incidents > All Incidents. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents > All Incidents Click Alerts > Events > All Events. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents > All Events Tip Using webhooks to send alert events to New Relic Insights, allows you to supplement your dashboards with Alerts data. The process is outlined in this community discussion post. Here is a simplified example of the results of this exercise: Application Number of dependencies RPM Hosts APDEX (avg) Last outage TTR (hrs) Routing Service 10 983 4 .93 2/19/18 .75 Tower Austin 1 58 1 .95 10/11/17 1.5 Proxy-East 11 498 4 .92 1/4/18 .25 Proxy-West 11 495 4 .97 12/3/17 .25 WebPortal 7 396 8 .98 4/1/18 2.5 Supplement this data with the data that your teams know about your service and that you gathered from the dependency exercise in step 1, and use that data to develop hypotheses about the highest risk areas in your services that should be mitigated. 3. Identify front-end dependency risk Once you’ve analyzed back-end dependencies, explore front-end dependencies. This is a critical step because as you walk higher up the stack and closer to the user, you will likely have more dependencies and abstractions. Service maps seamlessly integrate data from browser monitoring and mobile monitoring to help you understand the dependencies from front-end user interfaces to back-end services. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps Use the service map view to drill into front-end dependencies, and execute a similar exercise to the one you executed for back-end dependencies. This exercise will again expose data to help you identify risk areas you should address and optimize. We recommend that you conduct the analysis with user interface (UI) teams so that you can also gather a complementary qualitative understanding of what the UI teams consider critical based on their experience. A ranking from the UI teams of the most critical dependency is a useful output of this work. 4. Identify Microservice Dependencies If you are using microservices, you can have dozens, if not hundreds, of services that are calling each other. Use Distributed Tracing to see how all those services connect together and how your requests flow through those different services. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. A distributed trace is composed of multiple \"spans,\" which represent time spent in services or resources of those services. Click on the Distributed tracing menu in APM left nav. You can see “trace listing” view where you’ll be able to quickly identify slow traces and traces with errors. The scatter plot lets you easily see outliers. Below that are the trace summaries, click on a trace to see details. Dive into distributed traces to see how long each span takes. Click into each span to see historical performance charts and associated attributes that layer in the context you need to understand and troubleshoot issues. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Distributed tracing This rounds out your list of dependencies. 5. Create an action plan for risk mitigation Once you’ve analyzed the dependencies across your application from both front-end and back-end services, create an action plan to reduce dependency risks and achieve your service level objectives (SLO). As you prioritize these next steps, we recommend you keep these four principles in mind: Understand your risk tolerance.

Using too few resources in key areas can lead to errors or performance problems. Using too many resources can lead to unneeded costs. For example, you may find that you can redistribute application instances to hosts that have extra memory and CPU resources, and terminate or repurpose the hosts those instances came from. Use Infrastructure to ensure that your team is providing the right amount of compute power to meet customer expectations at appropriate costs. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you have reviewed New Relic's Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. 1. Evaluate your environment's current efficiency Use the Cluster Explorer to observe performance and dependencies across any Kubernetes environment, and to troubleshoot failures, bottlenecks, and other abnormal behavior—helping ensure that their applications are always available, running fast, and doing what they’re supposed to do. You get an overall view of the health of each cluster, and can drill down as needed for details on the state of a Kubernetes object, including a view of key metrics and logs. Start at the outer ring to view nodes of the cluster, with each node displaying CPU, memory, and storage performance metrics that provide at-a-glance understanding of the node’s overall health. Specify a lower and upper RAM and CPU limits for each container using requests and limits. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts: To evaluate your operating environment's efficiency, review the Infrastructure metrics (including averages that show as dotted lines), watch for outliers, and expand and sort the table's Memory used column. If you are using on-premise hosts (or Docker without Kubernetes), you can see the health of your hosts and containers in Infrastructure. Again, focus on CPU %, Load Average and Memory Used %. These metrics provide a good overview of your environment’s capacity. 2. Identify underutilized hosts and applications As you identify hosts that have extra capacity, start with memory usage, as that is a common limiting factor: From the Infrastructure Hosts page, expand [Expand icon] the table, then sort the Memory used column in descending order. To identify good redistribution candidates, look for hosts using a small amount of memory that have a small number of applications deployed on them. Also consider the health of an application before moving it to a different host. To ensure that an application has predictable performance, use APM. From the APM Overview page, track metrics for Apdex (user satisfaction) and average response time for transactions. Review other app performance details from the APM UI. Stabilize applications that are volatile before introducing other variables into their runtime performance. 3. Use the Cloud Optimize Nerdpack Cloud Optimize analyzes your cloud environment using the New Relic Infrastructure cloud integrations(for AWS, GCP, Azure and Alibaba). It compares the size of your instances to their utilization, identifying resources that are sized larger than needed. Cloud Optimize will estimate your savings by optimizing resource size.

      "body": "Successfully scaling DevOps requires a robust understanding of dependencies across application teams and related services. Use New Relics service maps to discover and mitigate risky dependencies from upstream and downstream services. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you’ve completed the previous DevOps procedures. 1. Analyze dependencies with service maps Use service maps for each application and note any dependent systems and transactions. New Relic recommends that you start by viewing the entire architecture using the Discover your environment option. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list This initial view shows all applications that are configured in your account. Applications that have violated a warning threshold are shown in yellow, and those with an active alert are shown in red. Healthy applications appear in green. New Relic uses a bold line to map applications to the services (such as databases) they connect to. Familiarize yourself with these maps to see how applications and their services fit together. Take note of which applications have the most dependencies and which rely on the same dependency, such as an API. Click an application to see high level metrics about that app, including throughput, response time, Apdex score, and error rate for the last 30 minutes. Tracking throughput is a good way to determine which of your applications are serving the most traffic. After looking at the architecture as a whole, review the applications that have the most dependencies. Select the App/Services list to see a full list of your applications. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list In this example, we’ve chosen Tower-Chicago from the App/Services list. All of the traffic being sent to Tower-Chicago is coming from Proxy-East. In this case, Tower-Chicago is showing 48.3 requests per minute, or 11.3% of the 426 requests per minute flowing through Proxy-East. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list In most cases, the separate applications and services represented in service maps are created and maintained by separate teams. This exercise of walking through the dependencies of your architecture should involve representatives from each of those teams. Teams should work together to ask questions such as: How critical is this particular dependency? What would happen if it were to go down? What happened last time it went down? Was there a revenue loss? 2. Identify back-end application dependency risks Once you’ve analyzed your applications’ dependencies, you’ll want to examine the quality of dependency execution. For example, is the dependency stable and predictable for each application or transaction you’ve identified? To do this, you’ll first need to gather as much information as you can about the applications from New Relic Insights, which helps you analyze data that is collected about the applications in more detail. Here is an example NRQL query to further analyze back-end service performance: SELECT count(appName)/30 as 'Throughput', apdex(duration), average(duration), stddev(duration), max(duration), count(error_type), uniquecount(host) FROM Transaction FACET appName SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO Copy This query shows you each application’s request per minute (throughput), Apdex score, and an overview of how the application is performing overall (through the standard deviation calculation, in which lower numbers are generally better). It also shows errors for the time period and the number of hosts on which the application is running. insights.newrelic.com > query results Next, gather information on incidents and events related to the services from New Relic Alerts: Click Alerts > Incidents > All Incidents. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents > All Incidents Click Alerts > Events > All Events. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents > All Events Tip Using webhooks to send alert events to New Relic Insights, allows you to supplement your dashboards with Alerts data. The process is outlined in this community discussion post. Here is a simplified example of the results of this exercise: Application Number of dependencies RPM Hosts APDEX (avg) Last outage TTR (hrs) Routing Service 10 983 4 .93 2/19/18 .75 Tower Austin 1 58 1 .95 10/11/17 1.5 Proxy-East 11 498 4 .92 1/4/18 .25 Proxy-West 11 495 4 .97 12/3/17 .25 WebPortal 7 396 8 .98 4/1/18 2.5 Supplement this data with the data that your teams know about your service and that you gathered from the dependency exercise in step 1, and use that data to develop hypotheses about the highest risk areas in your services that should be mitigated. 3. Identify front-end dependency risk Once you’ve analyzed back-end dependencies, explore front-end dependencies. This is a critical step because as you walk higher up the stack and closer to the user, you will likely have more dependencies and abstractions. Service maps seamlessly integrate data from browser monitoring and mobile monitoring to help you understand the dependencies from front-end user interfaces to back-end services. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps Use the service map view to drill into front-end dependencies, and execute a similar exercise to the one you executed for back-end dependencies. This exercise will again expose data to help you identify risk areas you should address and optimize. We recommend that you conduct the analysis with user interface (UI) teams so that you can also gather a complementary qualitative understanding of what the UI teams consider critical based on their experience. A ranking from the UI teams of the most critical dependency is a useful output of this work. 4. Identify Microservice Dependencies If you are using microservices, you can have dozens, if not hundreds, of services that are calling each other. Use Distributed Tracing to see how all those services connect together and how your requests flow through those different services. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. A distributed trace is composed of multiple \"spans,\" which represent time spent in services or resources of those services. Click on the Distributed tracing menu in APM left nav. You can see “trace listing” view where you’ll be able to quickly identify slow traces and traces with errors. The scatter plot lets you easily see outliers. Below that are the trace summaries, click on a trace to see details. Dive into distributed traces to see how long each span takes. Click into each span to see historical performance charts and associated attributes that layer in the context you need to understand and troubleshoot issues. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Distributed tracing This rounds out your list of dependencies. 5. Create an action plan for risk mitigation Once you’ve analyzed the dependencies across your application from both front-end and back-end services, create an action plan to reduce dependency risks and achieve your service level objectives (SLO). As you prioritize these next steps, we recommend you keep these four principles in mind: Understand your risk tolerance. It’s helpful to have a clear picture of your tolerance for risk, which ideally should be informed by your service level objectives (refer to the Establish Objectives and Baselines tutorial for more information). Set an alert policy to monitor dependencies that you’ve determined have a high relationship to SLO achievement. Minimize dependencies. The simpler you keep your code, the less functions you'll have referring to other modules. Removing unnecessary complexity is an important way to ensure you have a maintainable system that meets your customers’ expectations. Localize dependencies. For the code you write, package together functions that depend on each other whenever possible. Stabilize dependencies. When dependencies are unavoidable, mitigate risks by ensuring these dependencies point to modules that are the least likely to change or are easier to substitute. When your action plan is complete, monitor the results of the efforts. The efficacy of your actions to resolve dependency risks should ultimately be measured by your SLOs",

      "body": "Incident orchestration is the alignment of teams, tools, and processes to prepare for incidents and outages in your software. The goal is to provide your teams a predictable framework and process to: Maximize efficiency in communication and effort. Minimize the overall impact to your business. Prerequisites Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete these New Relic tutorials: Establish team dashboards Set up proactive alerting 1. Assign first responders to team dashboards Recommendation: For each team dashboard, make sure: It has an owner who assumes responsibility for the health of the applications and features it monitors. There is no ambiguity about who is responsible for attending to and resolving an alert condition. This policy will vary between organizations depending on size, structure, and culture. For example, some teams may prefer to assign dashboards and alerts based on de-facto features or application ownership. Other teams may prefer to adopt an on-call rotation (often referred to as \"pager duty\"). In on-call rotations, designated team members handle all first-line incident responses, and they resolve or delegate responsibilities based on predetermined incident thresholds. 2. Determine incident thresholds for alert conditions For each of your applications: Identify the thresholds for what is officially considered an incident. As you create alert policies with New Relic Alerts, make sure each set of threshold criteria is context-dependent. Document incident evaluation and known remediation procedures in runbooks. Include links to your runbooks when you define conditions and thresholds for your alert policies. For instance, a certain alert condition may be dismissable during low-traffic periods but require active remediation during peak hours. 3. Ensure alerts have auditable notification channels Recommendation: Make sure that communications during critical incidents take place in easily accessible and highly visible channels. A group chat room dedicated to incident communication is usually a great choice. This allows all stakeholders to participate or observe and provides a chronology of notifications, key decisions, and actions for postmortem analysis. Use any of the available notification channels in New Relic Alerts. For example, to set up a notification channel in Slack: Make sure your organization has completed New Relic's integration requirements with Slack. In the Slack app, select the dropdown in the top-left corner of the app, and select Customize Slack. Click Configure apps. From the list of app integrations, select New Relic. Expand the instructions for New Relic Alerts, and follow the steps to configure notifications from New Relic. 4. Automate triage and resolution steps Automation of simple or repeatable incident response tasks will increase efficiency and minimize the impact of incidents. With proper automation in place, you can disable or isolate faulty application components as soon as an alert threshold is reached, rather than after a notification has been issued. For example, a team managing an application for a digital media company wants to be able to remove commenting abilities from the website if the system has errors. In this case, they could: Add an endpoint to their front-end web application that will toggle a feature flag enabling or disabling the UI components associated with posting comments on an article. Create an alert policy with a threshold set on the sustained error rate in the commenting service. Assign a webhook notification channel that will send a POST request to this endpoint, as well as to the standard team notification channels. In this scenario, errors in the commenting system will trigger the webhook and remove the commenting UI from the website. Users can still use core functionality of the site without seeing errors generated by the commenting service. The application will maintain a stable but degraded state, allowing the team to focus on recovery without the pressure of preventing users from accessing the site. You can also use webhooks to create issues and action items in ticketing systems that have REST APIs, such as Zendesk. Use New Relic Alerts to create a webhook notification channel, and customize the webhook payload as needed. New Relic also provides integrations for some common ticketing systems. You can use any of the available integrations to file tickets from APM.",

Here is an example NRQL query to further analyze back-end service performance: SELECT count(appName)/30 as 'Throughput', apdex(duration), average(duration), stddev(duration), max(duration), count(error_type), uniquecount(host) FROM Transaction FACET appName SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO Copy This query shows you each application’s request per minute (throughput), Apdex score, and an overview of how the application is performing overall (through the standard deviation calculation, in which lower numbers are generally better). It also shows errors for the time period and the number of hosts on which the application is running. insights.newrelic.com > query results Next, gather information on incidents and events related to the services from New Relic Alerts: Click Alerts > Incidents > All Incidents. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents > All Incidents Click Alerts > Events > All Events. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents > All Events Tip Using webhooks to send alert events to New Relic Insights, allows you to supplement your dashboards with Alerts data. The process is outlined in this community discussion post. Here is a simplified example of the results of this exercise: Application Number of dependencies RPM Hosts APDEX (avg) Last outage TTR (hrs) Routing Service 10 983 4 .93 2/19/18 .75 Tower Austin 1 58 1 .95 10/11/17 1.5 Proxy-East 11 498 4 .92 1/4/18 .25 Proxy-West 11 495 4 .97 12/3/17 .25 WebPortal 7 396 8 .98 4/1/18 2.5 Supplement this data with the data that your teams know about your service and that you gathered from the dependency exercise in step 1, and use that data to develop hypotheses about the highest risk areas in your services that should be mitigated. 3. Identify front-end dependency risk Once you’ve analyzed back-end dependencies, explore front-end dependencies. This is a critical step because as you walk higher up the stack and closer to the user, you will likely have more dependencies and abstractions. Service maps seamlessly integrate data from browser monitoring and mobile monitoring to help you understand the dependencies from front-end user interfaces to back-end services. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps Use the service map view to drill into front-end dependencies, and execute a similar exercise to the one you executed for back-end dependencies. This exercise will again expose data to help you identify risk areas you should address and optimize. We recommend that you conduct the analysis with user interface (UI) teams so that you can also gather a complementary qualitative understanding of what the UI teams consider critical based on their experience. A ranking from the UI teams of the most critical dependency is a useful output of this work. 4. Identify Microservice Dependencies If you are using microservices, you can have dozens, if not hundreds, of services that are calling each other. Use Distributed Tracing to see how all those services connect together and how your requests flow through those different services. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. A distributed trace is composed of multiple \"spans,\" which represent time spent in services or resources of those services. Click on the Distributed tracing menu in APM left nav. You can see “trace listing” view where you’ll be able to quickly identify slow traces and traces with errors. The scatter plot lets you easily see outliers. Below that are the trace summaries, click on a trace to see details. Dive into distributed traces to see how long each span takes. Click into each span to see historical performance charts and associated attributes that layer in the context you need to understand and troubleshoot issues. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Distributed tracing This rounds out your list of dependencies. 5. Create an action plan for risk mitigation Once you’ve analyzed the dependencies across your application from both front-end and back-end services, create an action plan to reduce dependency risks and achieve your service level objectives (SLO). As you prioritize these next steps, we recommend you keep these four principles in mind: Understand your risk tolerance. It’s helpful to have a clear picture of your tolerance for risk, which ideally should be informed by your service level objectives (refer to the Establish Objectives and Baselines tutorial for more information). Set an alert policy to monitor dependencies that you’ve determined have a high relationship to SLO achievement. Minimize dependencies. The simpler you keep your code, the less functions you'll have referring to other modules. Removing unnecessary complexity is an important way to ensure you have a maintainable system that meets your customers’ expectations. Localize dependencies. For the code you write, package together functions that depend on each other whenever possible. Stabilize dependencies. When dependencies are unavoidable, mitigate risks by ensuring these dependencies point to modules that are the least likely to change or are easier to substitute. When your action plan is complete, monitor the results of the efforts. The efficacy of your actions to resolve dependency risks should ultimately be measured by your SLOs",

Using too few resources in key areas can lead to errors or performance problems. Using too many resources can lead to unneeded costs. For example, you may find that you can redistribute application instances to hosts that have extra memory and CPU resources, and terminate or repurpose the hosts those instances came from. Use Infrastructure to ensure that your team is providing the right amount of compute power to meet customer expectations at appropriate costs. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you have reviewed New Relic's Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. 1. Evaluate your environment's current efficiency Use the Cluster Explorer to observe performance and dependencies across any Kubernetes environment, and to troubleshoot failures, bottlenecks, and other abnormal behavior—helping ensure that their applications are always available, running fast, and doing what they’re supposed to do. You get an overall view of the health of each cluster, and can drill down as needed for details on the state of a Kubernetes object, including a view of key metrics and logs. Start at the outer ring to view nodes of the cluster, with each node displaying CPU, memory, and storage performance metrics that provide at-a-glance understanding of the node’s overall health. Specify a lower and upper RAM and CPU limits for each container using requests and limits. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts: To evaluate your operating environment's efficiency, review the Infrastructure metrics (including averages that show as dotted lines), watch for outliers, and expand and sort the table's Memory used column. If you are using on-premise hosts (or Docker without Kubernetes), you can see the health of your hosts and containers in Infrastructure. Again, focus on CPU %, Load Average and Memory Used %. These metrics provide a good overview of your environment’s capacity. 2. Identify underutilized hosts and applications As you identify hosts that have extra capacity, start with memory usage, as that is a common limiting factor: From the Infrastructure Hosts page, expand [Expand icon] the table, then sort the Memory used column in descending order. To identify good redistribution candidates, look for hosts using a small amount of memory that have a small number of applications deployed on them. Also consider the health of an application before moving it to a different host. To ensure that an application has predictable performance, use APM. From the APM Overview page, track metrics for Apdex (user satisfaction) and average response time for transactions. Review other app performance details from the APM UI. Stabilize applications that are volatile before introducing other variables into their runtime performance. 3. Use the Cloud Optimize Nerdpack Cloud Optimize analyzes your cloud environment using the New Relic Infrastructure cloud integrations(for AWS, GCP, Azure and Alibaba). It compares the size of your instances to their utilization, identifying resources that are sized larger than needed. Cloud Optimize will estimate your savings by optimizing resource size.

Capturing tangible, measurable metrics from before and after each change allows teams to optimize changes in isolation, and reduce the impact to other ongoing changes. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Establish objectives and baselines tutorial and set the appropriate KPI targets for your applications. 1. Integrate measurements into your development process With appropriate measurements incorporated into all phases of your development cycle, you can surface errors and performance issues before your customers uncover them. As your application teams plan their work, use your KPI dashboards in daily stand-ups and other planning meetings to analyze necessary debugging work, assess whether recent deployments were successful, and to prioritize other work efforts. When development and operations teams use dashboards during planning and discussions, they ensure that they’re consistently incorporating feedback about customer experiences and reliability risks into their development efforts. For proper testing, ensure that instrumentation in your pre-production environments is in parity with your production environments. Use dashboards to compare the environments and verify that the code and infrastructure changes you make are correct across them, and eliminate any anomalies before pushing code to production. 2. Add automated deployment markers It’s important to track deployments and how the impact of the code and infrastructure changes you make affect customer experience. APM’s deployment markers feature allows you to record deployments for each application. A deployment marker is an event indicating that a deployment happened, and it's paired with metadata available from your SCM system (such metadata typically includes the user, revision, change-log, etc.). APM displays a vertical line, or “marker”, on charts and graphs at the deployment event’s timestamp. When you hover over the line, APM displays the associated metadata for that deployment. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview APM also provides a chronological list of deployments of your application, and additional metrics, such as error rate and Apdex from the time of the deployment, are available as well. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Deployments Tracking deployments is an invaluable way to determine the root cause of immediate, long-term, or gradual degradations in your application. Tip New Relic recommends that you make POST requests to the New Relic REST API as the final step of a successful CI/CD deployment as described in the API documentation. The following tools have integrations or plugins available to help automate this: Chef (see newrelic_depoyment) Jenkins Ansible 3. Test your pipeline with Infrastructure An important part of a successful DevOps transformation is a cultural shift toward smaller, more frequent changes to your code and infrastructure. After you complete the first two steps of this tutorial, begin to test and gather appropriate performance insights about your deployment pipeline to more clearly understand the impact of the changes you make. Code changes should be as small as possible in terms of the number of lines of code and source files you change. Changes should also involve as few team members as possible. This makes it much easier to identify issue owners and determine root causes if errors occur. Similarly, infrastructure changes should also have as small a footprint as possible to minimize the number of applications affected by each change. New Relic Infrastructure helps you see when an infrastructure change has caused a spike in issues, as shown in the following example: one.newrelic.com/apm > Infrastructure > Hosts For cloud infrastructure changes or larger code changes, consider using a blue/green deployment strategy. APM supports multiple app names which fits this model quite nicely. To implement this strategy: Deploy a version of your application to existing infrastructure using a rollup app name that signifies it as the “blue” version (or control version). Deploy a new version of your application to a subset of the infrastructure (or an alternate set of infrastructure) with a rollup name that signifies this as the “green” version (or experimental version). Ensure that traffic is routed appropriately between both versions. Compare established KPI dashboards of both versions against one another. Optimize the new version accordingly to meet your KPI targets. When you’re satisfied with the application’s performance, deploy the new version across your infrastructure using the original app name, and consider this the new baseline for any future changes you'll make to the application.",

Use New Relics service maps to discover and mitigate risky dependencies from upstream and downstream services. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you’ve completed the previous DevOps procedures. 1. Analyze dependencies with service maps Use service maps for each application and note any dependent systems and transactions. New Relic recommends that you start by viewing the entire architecture using the Discover your environment option. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list This initial view shows all applications that are configured in your account. Applications that have violated a warning threshold are shown in yellow, and those with an active alert are shown in red. Healthy applications appear in green. New Relic uses a bold line to map applications to the services (such as databases) they connect to. Familiarize yourself with these maps to see how applications and their services fit together. Take note of which applications have the most dependencies and which rely on the same dependency, such as an API. Click an application to see high level metrics about that app, including throughput, response time, Apdex score, and error rate for the last 30 minutes. Tracking throughput is a good way to determine which of your applications are serving the most traffic. After looking at the architecture as a whole, review the applications that have the most dependencies. Select the App/Services list to see a full list of your applications. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list In this example, we’ve chosen Tower-Chicago from the App/Services list. All of the traffic being sent to Tower-Chicago is coming from Proxy-East. In this case, Tower-Chicago is showing 48.3 requests per minute, or 11.3% of the 426 requests per minute flowing through Proxy-East. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list In most cases, the separate applications and services represented in service maps are created and maintained by separate teams. This exercise of walking through the dependencies of your architecture should involve representatives from each of those teams. Teams should work together to ask questions such as: How critical is this particular dependency? What would happen if it were to go down? What happened last time it went down? Was there a revenue loss? 2. Identify back-end application dependency risks Once you’ve analyzed your applications’ dependencies, you’ll want to examine the quality of dependency execution.

The goal is to provide your teams a predictable framework and process to: Maximize efficiency in communication and effort. Minimize the overall impact to your business. Prerequisites Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete these New Relic tutorials: Establish team dashboards Set up proactive alerting 1. Assign first responders to team dashboards Recommendation: For each team dashboard, make sure: It has an owner who assumes responsibility for the health of the applications and features it monitors. There is no ambiguity about who is responsible for attending to and resolving an alert condition. This policy will vary between organizations depending on size, structure, and culture. For example, some teams may prefer to assign dashboards and alerts based on de-facto features or application ownership. Other teams may prefer to adopt an on-call rotation (often referred to as \"pager duty\"). In on-call rotations, designated team members handle all first-line incident responses, and they resolve or delegate responsibilities based on predetermined incident thresholds. 2. Determine incident thresholds for alert conditions For each of your applications: Identify the thresholds for what is officially considered an incident. As you create alert policies with New Relic Alerts, make sure each set of threshold criteria is context-dependent. Document incident evaluation and known remediation procedures in runbooks. Include links to your runbooks when you define conditions and thresholds for your alert policies. For instance, a certain alert condition may be dismissable during low-traffic periods but require active remediation during peak hours. 3. Ensure alerts have auditable notification channels Recommendation: Make sure that communications during critical incidents take place in easily accessible and highly visible channels. A group chat room dedicated to incident communication is usually a great choice. This allows all stakeholders to participate or observe and provides a chronology of notifications, key decisions, and actions for postmortem analysis. Use any of the available notification channels in New Relic Alerts. For example, to set up a notification channel in Slack: Make sure your organization has completed New Relic's integration requirements with Slack. In the Slack app, select the dropdown in the top-left corner of the app, and select Customize Slack. Click Configure apps. From the list of app integrations, select New Relic. Expand the instructions for New Relic Alerts, and follow the steps to configure notifications from New Relic. 4. Automate triage and resolution steps Automation of simple or repeatable incident response tasks will increase efficiency and minimize the impact of incidents. With proper automation in place, you can disable or isolate faulty application components as soon as an alert threshold is reached, rather than after a notification has been issued. For example, a team managing an application for a digital media company wants to be able to remove commenting abilities from the website if the system has errors. In this case, they could: Add an endpoint to their front-end web application that will toggle a feature flag enabling or disabling the UI components associated with posting comments on an article. Create an alert policy with a threshold set on the sustained error rate in the commenting service. Assign a webhook notification channel that will send a POST request to this endpoint, as well as to the standard team notification channels. In this scenario, errors in the commenting system will trigger the webhook and remove the commenting UI from the website. Users can still use core functionality of the site without seeing errors generated by the commenting service. The application will maintain a stable but degraded state, allowing the team to focus on recovery without the pressure of preventing users from accessing the site. You can also use webhooks to create issues and action items in ticketing systems that have REST APIs, such as Zendesk. Use New Relic Alerts to create a webhook notification channel, and customize the webhook payload as needed. New Relic also provides integrations for some common ticketing systems. You can use any of the available integrations to file tickets from APM.",

      "body": "A properly instrumented system gives teams full visibility into the impact of the changes they make. Capturing tangible, measurable metrics from before and after each change allows teams to optimize changes in isolation, and reduce the impact to other ongoing changes. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Establish objectives and baselines tutorial and set the appropriate KPI targets for your applications. 1. Integrate measurements into your development process With appropriate measurements incorporated into all phases of your development cycle, you can surface errors and performance issues before your customers uncover them. As your application teams plan their work, use your KPI dashboards in daily stand-ups and other planning meetings to analyze necessary debugging work, assess whether recent deployments were successful, and to prioritize other work efforts. When development and operations teams use dashboards during planning and discussions, they ensure that they’re consistently incorporating feedback about customer experiences and reliability risks into their development efforts. For proper testing, ensure that instrumentation in your pre-production environments is in parity with your production environments. Use dashboards to compare the environments and verify that the code and infrastructure changes you make are correct across them, and eliminate any anomalies before pushing code to production. 2. Add automated deployment markers It’s important to track deployments and how the impact of the code and infrastructure changes you make affect customer experience. APM’s deployment markers feature allows you to record deployments for each application. A deployment marker is an event indicating that a deployment happened, and it's paired with metadata available from your SCM system (such metadata typically includes the user, revision, change-log, etc.). APM displays a vertical line, or “marker”, on charts and graphs at the deployment event’s timestamp. When you hover over the line, APM displays the associated metadata for that deployment. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview APM also provides a chronological list of deployments of your application, and additional metrics, such as error rate and Apdex from the time of the deployment, are available as well. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Deployments Tracking deployments is an invaluable way to determine the root cause of immediate, long-term, or gradual degradations in your application. Tip New Relic recommends that you make POST requests to the New Relic REST API as the final step of a successful CI/CD deployment as described in the API documentation. The following tools have integrations or plugins available to help automate this: Chef (see newrelic_depoyment) Jenkins Ansible 3. Test your pipeline with Infrastructure An important part of a successful DevOps transformation is a cultural shift toward smaller, more frequent changes to your code and infrastructure. After you complete the first two steps of this tutorial, begin to test and gather appropriate performance insights about your deployment pipeline to more clearly understand the impact of the changes you make. Code changes should be as small as possible in terms of the number of lines of code and source files you change. Changes should also involve as few team members as possible. This makes it much easier to identify issue owners and determine root causes if errors occur. Similarly, infrastructure changes should also have as small a footprint as possible to minimize the number of applications affected by each change. New Relic Infrastructure helps you see when an infrastructure change has caused a spike in issues, as shown in the following example: one.newrelic.com/apm > Infrastructure > Hosts For cloud infrastructure changes or larger code changes, consider using a blue/green deployment strategy. APM supports multiple app names which fits this model quite nicely. To implement this strategy: Deploy a version of your application to existing infrastructure using a rollup app name that signifies it as the “blue” version (or control version). Deploy a new version of your application to a subset of the infrastructure (or an alternate set of infrastructure) with a rollup name that signifies this as the “green” version (or experimental version). Ensure that traffic is routed appropriately between both versions. Compare established KPI dashboards of both versions against one another. Optimize the new version accordingly to meet your KPI targets. When you’re satisfied with the application’s performance, deploy the new version across your infrastructure using the original app name, and consider this the new baseline for any future changes you'll make to the application.",

      "body": "Successfully scaling DevOps requires a robust understanding of dependencies across application teams and related services. Use New Relics service maps to discover and mitigate risky dependencies from upstream and downstream services. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you’ve completed the previous DevOps procedures. 1. Analyze dependencies with service maps Use service maps for each application and note any dependent systems and transactions. New Relic recommends that you start by viewing the entire architecture using the Discover your environment option. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list This initial view shows all applications that are configured in your account. Applications that have violated a warning threshold are shown in yellow, and those with an active alert are shown in red. Healthy applications appear in green. New Relic uses a bold line to map applications to the services (such as databases) they connect to. Familiarize yourself with these maps to see how applications and their services fit together. Take note of which applications have the most dependencies and which rely on the same dependency, such as an API. Click an application to see high level metrics about that app, including throughput, response time, Apdex score, and error rate for the last 30 minutes. Tracking throughput is a good way to determine which of your applications are serving the most traffic. After looking at the architecture as a whole, review the applications that have the most dependencies. Select the App/Services list to see a full list of your applications. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list In this example, we’ve chosen Tower-Chicago from the App/Services list. All of the traffic being sent to Tower-Chicago is coming from Proxy-East. In this case, Tower-Chicago is showing 48.3 requests per minute, or 11.3% of the 426 requests per minute flowing through Proxy-East. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list In most cases, the separate applications and services represented in service maps are created and maintained by separate teams. This exercise of walking through the dependencies of your architecture should involve representatives from each of those teams. Teams should work together to ask questions such as: How critical is this particular dependency? What would happen if it were to go down? What happened last time it went down? Was there a revenue loss? 2. Identify back-end application dependency risks Once you’ve analyzed your applications’ dependencies, you’ll want to examine the quality of dependency execution. For example, is the dependency stable and predictable for each application or transaction you’ve identified? To do this, you’ll first need to gather as much information as you can about the applications from New Relic Insights, which helps you analyze data that is collected about the applications in more detail. Here is an example NRQL query to further analyze back-end service performance: SELECT count(appName)/30 as 'Throughput', apdex(duration), average(duration), stddev(duration), max(duration), count(error_type), uniquecount(host) FROM Transaction FACET appName SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO Copy This query shows you each application’s request per minute (throughput), Apdex score, and an overview of how the application is performing overall (through the standard deviation calculation, in which lower numbers are generally better). It also shows errors for the time period and the number of hosts on which the application is running. insights.newrelic.com > query results Next, gather information on incidents and events related to the services from New Relic Alerts: Click Alerts > Incidents > All Incidents. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents > All Incidents Click Alerts > Events > All Events. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents > All Events Tip Using webhooks to send alert events to New Relic Insights, allows you to supplement your dashboards with Alerts data. The process is outlined in this community discussion post. Here is a simplified example of the results of this exercise: Application Number of dependencies RPM Hosts APDEX (avg) Last outage TTR (hrs) Routing Service 10 983 4 .93 2/19/18 .75 Tower Austin 1 58 1 .95 10/11/17 1.5 Proxy-East 11 498 4 .92 1/4/18 .25 Proxy-West 11 495 4 .97 12/3/17 .25 WebPortal 7 396 8 .98 4/1/18 2.5 Supplement this data with the data that your teams know about your service and that you gathered from the dependency exercise in step 1, and use that data to develop hypotheses about the highest risk areas in your services that should be mitigated. 3. Identify front-end dependency risk Once you’ve analyzed back-end dependencies, explore front-end dependencies. This is a critical step because as you walk higher up the stack and closer to the user, you will likely have more dependencies and abstractions. Service maps seamlessly integrate data from browser monitoring and mobile monitoring to help you understand the dependencies from front-end user interfaces to back-end services. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps Use the service map view to drill into front-end dependencies, and execute a similar exercise to the one you executed for back-end dependencies. This exercise will again expose data to help you identify risk areas you should address and optimize. We recommend that you conduct the analysis with user interface (UI) teams so that you can also gather a complementary qualitative understanding of what the UI teams consider critical based on their experience. A ranking from the UI teams of the most critical dependency is a useful output of this work. 4. Identify Microservice Dependencies If you are using microservices, you can have dozens, if not hundreds, of services that are calling each other. Use Distributed Tracing to see how all those services connect together and how your requests flow through those different services. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. A distributed trace is composed of multiple \"spans,\" which represent time spent in services or resources of those services. Click on the Distributed tracing menu in APM left nav. You can see “trace listing” view where you’ll be able to quickly identify slow traces and traces with errors. The scatter plot lets you easily see outliers. Below that are the trace summaries, click on a trace to see details. Dive into distributed traces to see how long each span takes. Click into each span to see historical performance charts and associated attributes that layer in the context you need to understand and troubleshoot issues. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Distributed tracing This rounds out your list of dependencies. 5. Create an action plan for risk mitigation Once you’ve analyzed the dependencies across your application from both front-end and back-end services, create an action plan to reduce dependency risks and achieve your service level objectives (SLO). As you prioritize these next steps, we recommend you keep these four principles in mind: Understand your risk tolerance. It’s helpful to have a clear picture of your tolerance for risk, which ideally should be informed by your service level objectives (refer to the Establish Objectives and Baselines tutorial for more information). Set an alert policy to monitor dependencies that you’ve determined have a high relationship to SLO achievement. Minimize dependencies. The simpler you keep your code, the less functions you'll have referring to other modules. Removing unnecessary complexity is an important way to ensure you have a maintainable system that meets your customers’ expectations. Localize dependencies. For the code you write, package together functions that depend on each other whenever possible. Stabilize dependencies. When dependencies are unavoidable, mitigate risks by ensuring these dependencies point to modules that are the least likely to change or are easier to substitute. When your action plan is complete, monitor the results of the efforts. The efficacy of your actions to resolve dependency risks should ultimately be measured by your SLOs",

The goal is to provide your teams a predictable framework and process to: Maximize efficiency in communication and effort. Minimize the overall impact to your business. Prerequisites Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete these New Relic tutorials: Establish team dashboards Set up proactive alerting 1. Assign first responders to team dashboards Recommendation: For each team dashboard, make sure: It has an owner who assumes responsibility for the health of the applications and features it monitors. There is no ambiguity about who is responsible for attending to and resolving an alert condition. This policy will vary between organizations depending on size, structure, and culture. For example, some teams may prefer to assign dashboards and alerts based on de-facto features or application ownership. Other teams may prefer to adopt an on-call rotation (often referred to as \"pager duty\"). In on-call rotations, designated team members handle all first-line incident responses, and they resolve or delegate responsibilities based on predetermined incident thresholds. 2. Determine incident thresholds for alert conditions For each of your applications: Identify the thresholds for what is officially considered an incident. As you create alert policies with New Relic Alerts, make sure each set of threshold criteria is context-dependent. Document incident evaluation and known remediation procedures in runbooks. Include links to your runbooks when you define conditions and thresholds for your alert policies. For instance, a certain alert condition may be dismissable during low-traffic periods but require active remediation during peak hours. 3. Ensure alerts have auditable notification channels Recommendation: Make sure that communications during critical incidents take place in easily accessible and highly visible channels.

Using too few resources in key areas can lead to errors or performance problems. Using too many resources can lead to unneeded costs. For example, you may find that you can redistribute application instances to hosts that have extra memory and CPU resources, and terminate or repurpose the hosts those instances came from. Use Infrastructure to ensure that your team is providing the right amount of compute power to meet customer expectations at appropriate costs. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you have reviewed New Relic's Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. 1. Evaluate your environment's current efficiency Use the Cluster Explorer to observe performance and dependencies across any Kubernetes environment, and to troubleshoot failures, bottlenecks, and other abnormal behavior—helping ensure that their applications are always available, running fast, and doing what they’re supposed to do. You get an overall view of the health of each cluster, and can drill down as needed for details on the state of a Kubernetes object, including a view of key metrics and logs. Start at the outer ring to view nodes of the cluster, with each node displaying CPU, memory, and storage performance metrics that provide at-a-glance understanding of the node’s overall health. Specify a lower and upper RAM and CPU limits for each container using requests and limits. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts: To evaluate your operating environment's efficiency, review the Infrastructure metrics (including averages that show as dotted lines), watch for outliers, and expand and sort the table's Memory used column. If you are using on-premise hosts (or Docker without Kubernetes), you can see the health of your hosts and containers in Infrastructure. Again, focus on CPU %, Load Average and Memory Used %. These metrics provide a good overview of your environment’s capacity. 2. Identify underutilized hosts and applications As you identify hosts that have extra capacity, start with memory usage, as that is a common limiting factor: From the Infrastructure Hosts page, expand [Expand icon] the table, then sort the Memory used column in descending order. To identify good redistribution candidates, look for hosts using a small amount of memory that have a small number of applications deployed on them. Also consider the health of an application before moving it to a different host. To ensure that an application has predictable performance, use APM. From the APM Overview page, track metrics for Apdex (user satisfaction) and average response time for transactions. Review other app performance details from the APM UI. Stabilize applications that are volatile before introducing other variables into their runtime performance. 3. Use the Cloud Optimize Nerdpack Cloud Optimize analyzes your cloud environment using the New Relic Infrastructure cloud integrations(for AWS, GCP, Azure and Alibaba). It compares the size of your instances to their utilization, identifying resources that are sized larger than needed. Cloud Optimize will estimate your savings by optimizing resource size.

      "body": "Successfully scaling DevOps requires a robust understanding of dependencies across application teams and related services. Use New Relics service maps to discover and mitigate risky dependencies from upstream and downstream services. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you’ve completed the previous DevOps procedures. 1. Analyze dependencies with service maps Use service maps for each application and note any dependent systems and transactions. New Relic recommends that you start by viewing the entire architecture using the Discover your environment option. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list This initial view shows all applications that are configured in your account. Applications that have violated a warning threshold are shown in yellow, and those with an active alert are shown in red. Healthy applications appear in green. New Relic uses a bold line to map applications to the services (such as databases) they connect to. Familiarize yourself with these maps to see how applications and their services fit together. Take note of which applications have the most dependencies and which rely on the same dependency, such as an API. Click an application to see high level metrics about that app, including throughput, response time, Apdex score, and error rate for the last 30 minutes. Tracking throughput is a good way to determine which of your applications are serving the most traffic. After looking at the architecture as a whole, review the applications that have the most dependencies. Select the App/Services list to see a full list of your applications. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list In this example, we’ve chosen Tower-Chicago from the App/Services list. All of the traffic being sent to Tower-Chicago is coming from Proxy-East. In this case, Tower-Chicago is showing 48.3 requests per minute, or 11.3% of the 426 requests per minute flowing through Proxy-East. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list In most cases, the separate applications and services represented in service maps are created and maintained by separate teams. This exercise of walking through the dependencies of your architecture should involve representatives from each of those teams. Teams should work together to ask questions such as: How critical is this particular dependency? What would happen if it were to go down? What happened last time it went down? Was there a revenue loss? 2. Identify back-end application dependency risks Once you’ve analyzed your applications’ dependencies, you’ll want to examine the quality of dependency execution. For example, is the dependency stable and predictable for each application or transaction you’ve identified? To do this, you’ll first need to gather as much information as you can about the applications from New Relic Insights, which helps you analyze data that is collected about the applications in more detail. Here is an example NRQL query to further analyze back-end service performance: SELECT count(appName)/30 as 'Throughput', apdex(duration), average(duration), stddev(duration), max(duration), count(error_type), uniquecount(host) FROM Transaction FACET appName SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO Copy This query shows you each application’s request per minute (throughput), Apdex score, and an overview of how the application is performing overall (through the standard deviation calculation, in which lower numbers are generally better). It also shows errors for the time period and the number of hosts on which the application is running. insights.newrelic.com > query results Next, gather information on incidents and events related to the services from New Relic Alerts: Click Alerts > Incidents > All Incidents. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents > All Incidents Click Alerts > Events > All Events. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents > All Events Tip Using webhooks to send alert events to New Relic Insights, allows you to supplement your dashboards with Alerts data. The process is outlined in this community discussion post. Here is a simplified example of the results of this exercise: Application Number of dependencies RPM Hosts APDEX (avg) Last outage TTR (hrs) Routing Service 10 983 4 .93 2/19/18 .75 Tower Austin 1 58 1 .95 10/11/17 1.5 Proxy-East 11 498 4 .92 1/4/18 .25 Proxy-West 11 495 4 .97 12/3/17 .25 WebPortal 7 396 8 .98 4/1/18 2.5 Supplement this data with the data that your teams know about your service and that you gathered from the dependency exercise in step 1, and use that data to develop hypotheses about the highest risk areas in your services that should be mitigated. 3. Identify front-end dependency risk Once you’ve analyzed back-end dependencies, explore front-end dependencies. This is a critical step because as you walk higher up the stack and closer to the user, you will likely have more dependencies and abstractions. Service maps seamlessly integrate data from browser monitoring and mobile monitoring to help you understand the dependencies from front-end user interfaces to back-end services. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps Use the service map view to drill into front-end dependencies, and execute a similar exercise to the one you executed for back-end dependencies. This exercise will again expose data to help you identify risk areas you should address and optimize. We recommend that you conduct the analysis with user interface (UI) teams so that you can also gather a complementary qualitative understanding of what the UI teams consider critical based on their experience. A ranking from the UI teams of the most critical dependency is a useful output of this work. 4. Identify Microservice Dependencies If you are using microservices, you can have dozens, if not hundreds, of services that are calling each other. Use Distributed Tracing to see how all those services connect together and how your requests flow through those different services. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. A distributed trace is composed of multiple \"spans,\" which represent time spent in services or resources of those services. Click on the Distributed tracing menu in APM left nav. You can see “trace listing” view where you’ll be able to quickly identify slow traces and traces with errors. The scatter plot lets you easily see outliers. Below that are the trace summaries, click on a trace to see details. Dive into distributed traces to see how long each span takes. Click into each span to see historical performance charts and associated attributes that layer in the context you need to understand and troubleshoot issues. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Distributed tracing This rounds out your list of dependencies. 5. Create an action plan for risk mitigation Once you’ve analyzed the dependencies across your application from both front-end and back-end services, create an action plan to reduce dependency risks and achieve your service level objectives (SLO). As you prioritize these next steps, we recommend you keep these four principles in mind: Understand your risk tolerance. It’s helpful to have a clear picture of your tolerance for risk, which ideally should be informed by your service level objectives (refer to the Establish Objectives and Baselines tutorial for more information). Set an alert policy to monitor dependencies that you’ve determined have a high relationship to SLO achievement. Minimize dependencies. The simpler you keep your code, the less functions you'll have referring to other modules. Removing unnecessary complexity is an important way to ensure you have a maintainable system that meets your customers’ expectations. Localize dependencies. For the code you write, package together functions that depend on each other whenever possible. Stabilize dependencies. When dependencies are unavoidable, mitigate risks by ensuring these dependencies point to modules that are the least likely to change or are easier to substitute. When your action plan is complete, monitor the results of the efforts. The efficacy of your actions to resolve dependency risks should ultimately be measured by your SLOs",

      "body": "Incident orchestration is the alignment of teams, tools, and processes to prepare for incidents and outages in your software. The goal is to provide your teams a predictable framework and process to: Maximize efficiency in communication and effort. Minimize the overall impact to your business. Prerequisites Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete these New Relic tutorials: Establish team dashboards Set up proactive alerting 1. Assign first responders to team dashboards Recommendation: For each team dashboard, make sure: It has an owner who assumes responsibility for the health of the applications and features it monitors. There is no ambiguity about who is responsible for attending to and resolving an alert condition. This policy will vary between organizations depending on size, structure, and culture. For example, some teams may prefer to assign dashboards and alerts based on de-facto features or application ownership. Other teams may prefer to adopt an on-call rotation (often referred to as \"pager duty\"). In on-call rotations, designated team members handle all first-line incident responses, and they resolve or delegate responsibilities based on predetermined incident thresholds. 2. Determine incident thresholds for alert conditions For each of your applications: Identify the thresholds for what is officially considered an incident. As you create alert policies with New Relic Alerts, make sure each set of threshold criteria is context-dependent. Document incident evaluation and known remediation procedures in runbooks. Include links to your runbooks when you define conditions and thresholds for your alert policies. For instance, a certain alert condition may be dismissable during low-traffic periods but require active remediation during peak hours. 3. Ensure alerts have auditable notification channels Recommendation: Make sure that communications during critical incidents take place in easily accessible and highly visible channels. A group chat room dedicated to incident communication is usually a great choice. This allows all stakeholders to participate or observe and provides a chronology of notifications, key decisions, and actions for postmortem analysis. Use any of the available notification channels in New Relic Alerts. For example, to set up a notification channel in Slack: Make sure your organization has completed New Relic's integration requirements with Slack. In the Slack app, select the dropdown in the top-left corner of the app, and select Customize Slack. Click Configure apps. From the list of app integrations, select New Relic. Expand the instructions for New Relic Alerts, and follow the steps to configure notifications from New Relic. 4. Automate triage and resolution steps Automation of simple or repeatable incident response tasks will increase efficiency and minimize the impact of incidents. With proper automation in place, you can disable or isolate faulty application components as soon as an alert threshold is reached, rather than after a notification has been issued. For example, a team managing an application for a digital media company wants to be able to remove commenting abilities from the website if the system has errors. In this case, they could: Add an endpoint to their front-end web application that will toggle a feature flag enabling or disabling the UI components associated with posting comments on an article. Create an alert policy with a threshold set on the sustained error rate in the commenting service. Assign a webhook notification channel that will send a POST request to this endpoint, as well as to the standard team notification channels. In this scenario, errors in the commenting system will trigger the webhook and remove the commenting UI from the website. Users can still use core functionality of the site without seeing errors generated by the commenting service. The application will maintain a stable but degraded state, allowing the team to focus on recovery without the pressure of preventing users from accessing the site. You can also use webhooks to create issues and action items in ticketing systems that have REST APIs, such as Zendesk. Use New Relic Alerts to create a webhook notification channel, and customize the webhook payload as needed. New Relic also provides integrations for some common ticketing systems. You can use any of the available integrations to file tickets from APM.",

Using too few resources in key areas can lead to errors or performance problems. Using too many resources can lead to unneeded costs. For example, you may find that you can redistribute application instances to hosts that have extra memory and CPU resources, and terminate or repurpose the hosts those instances came from. Use Infrastructure to ensure that your team is providing the right amount of compute power to meet customer expectations at appropriate costs. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you have reviewed New Relic's Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. 1. Evaluate your environment's current efficiency Use the Cluster Explorer to observe performance and dependencies across any Kubernetes environment, and to troubleshoot failures, bottlenecks, and other abnormal behavior—helping ensure that their applications are always available, running fast, and doing what they’re supposed to do. You get an overall view of the health of each cluster, and can drill down as needed for details on the state of a Kubernetes object, including a view of key metrics and logs. Start at the outer ring to view nodes of the cluster, with each node displaying CPU, memory, and storage performance metrics that provide at-a-glance understanding of the node’s overall health. Specify a lower and upper RAM and CPU limits for each container using requests and limits. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts: To evaluate your operating environment's efficiency, review the Infrastructure metrics (including averages that show as dotted lines), watch for outliers, and expand and sort the table's Memory used column. If you are using on-premise hosts (or Docker without Kubernetes), you can see the health of your hosts and containers in Infrastructure. Again, focus on CPU %, Load Average and Memory Used %. These metrics provide a good overview of your environment’s capacity. 2. Identify underutilized hosts and applications As you identify hosts that have extra capacity, start with memory usage, as that is a common limiting factor: From the Infrastructure Hosts page, expand [Expand icon] the table, then sort the Memory used column in descending order. To identify good redistribution candidates, look for hosts using a small amount of memory that have a small number of applications deployed on them. Also consider the health of an application before moving it to a different host. To ensure that an application has predictable performance, use APM. From the APM Overview page, track metrics for Apdex (user satisfaction) and average response time for transactions. Review other app performance details from the APM UI. Stabilize applications that are volatile before introducing other variables into their runtime performance. 3. Use the Cloud Optimize Nerdpack Cloud Optimize analyzes your cloud environment using the New Relic Infrastructure cloud integrations(for AWS, GCP, Azure and Alibaba). It compares the size of your instances to their utilization, identifying resources that are sized larger than needed. Cloud Optimize will estimate your savings by optimizing resource size.

The goal is to provide your teams a predictable framework and process to: Maximize efficiency in communication and effort. Minimize the overall impact to your business. Prerequisites Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete these New Relic tutorials: Establish team dashboards Set up proactive alerting 1. Assign first responders to team dashboards Recommendation: For each team dashboard, make sure: It has an owner who assumes responsibility for the health of the applications and features it monitors. There is no ambiguity about who is responsible for attending to and resolving an alert condition. This policy will vary between organizations depending on size, structure, and culture. For example, some teams may prefer to assign dashboards and alerts based on de-facto features or application ownership. Other teams may prefer to adopt an on-call rotation (often referred to as \"pager duty\"). In on-call rotations, designated team members handle all first-line incident responses, and they resolve or delegate responsibilities based on predetermined incident thresholds. 2. Determine incident thresholds for alert conditions For each of your applications: Identify the thresholds for what is officially considered an incident. As you create alert policies with New Relic Alerts, make sure each set of threshold criteria is context-dependent. Document incident evaluation and known remediation procedures in runbooks. Include links to your runbooks when you define conditions and thresholds for your alert policies. For instance, a certain alert condition may be dismissable during low-traffic periods but require active remediation during peak hours. 3. Ensure alerts have auditable notification channels Recommendation: Make sure that communications during critical incidents take place in easily accessible and highly visible channels. A group chat room dedicated to incident communication is usually a great choice. This allows all stakeholders to participate or observe and provides a chronology of notifications, key decisions, and actions for postmortem analysis. Use any of the available notification channels in New Relic Alerts. For example, to set up a notification channel in Slack: Make sure your organization has completed New Relic's integration requirements with Slack. In the Slack app, select the dropdown in the top-left corner of the app, and select Customize Slack. Click Configure apps. From the list of app integrations, select New Relic. Expand the instructions for New Relic Alerts, and follow the steps to configure notifications from New Relic. 4. Automate triage and resolution steps Automation of simple or repeatable incident response tasks will increase efficiency and minimize the impact of incidents. With proper automation in place, you can disable or isolate faulty application components as soon as an alert threshold is reached, rather than after a notification has been issued. For example, a team managing an application for a digital media company wants to be able to remove commenting abilities from the website if the system has errors. In this case, they could: Add an endpoint to their front-end web application that will toggle a feature flag enabling or disabling the UI components associated with posting comments on an article. Create an alert policy with a threshold set on the sustained error rate in the commenting service. Assign a webhook notification channel that will send a POST request to this endpoint, as well as to the standard team notification channels. In this scenario, errors in the commenting system will trigger the webhook and remove the commenting UI from the website. Users can still use core functionality of the site without seeing errors generated by the commenting service. The application will maintain a stable but degraded state, allowing the team to focus on recovery without the pressure of preventing users from accessing the site. You can also use webhooks to create issues and action items in ticketing systems that have REST APIs, such as Zendesk. Use New Relic Alerts to create a webhook notification channel, and customize the webhook payload as needed. New Relic also provides integrations for some common ticketing systems. You can use any of the available integrations to file tickets from APM.",

These metrics provide a good overview of your environment’s capacity. 2. Identify underutilized hosts and applications As you identify hosts that have extra capacity, start with memory usage, as that is a common limiting factor: From the Infrastructure Hosts page, expand [Expand icon] the table, then sort the Memory used column in descending order. To identify good redistribution candidates, look for hosts using a small amount of memory that have a small number of applications deployed on them. Also consider the health of an application before moving it to a different host. To ensure that an application has predictable performance, use APM. From the APM Overview page, track metrics for Apdex (user satisfaction) and average response time for transactions. Review other app performance details from the APM UI.

      "body": "A properly instrumented system gives teams full visibility into the impact of the changes they make. Capturing tangible, measurable metrics from before and after each change allows teams to optimize changes in isolation, and reduce the impact to other ongoing changes. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete the Establish objectives and baselines tutorial and set the appropriate KPI targets for your applications. 1. Integrate measurements into your development process With appropriate measurements incorporated into all phases of your development cycle, you can surface errors and performance issues before your customers uncover them. As your application teams plan their work, use your KPI dashboards in daily stand-ups and other planning meetings to analyze necessary debugging work, assess whether recent deployments were successful, and to prioritize other work efforts. When development and operations teams use dashboards during planning and discussions, they ensure that they’re consistently incorporating feedback about customer experiences and reliability risks into their development efforts. For proper testing, ensure that instrumentation in your pre-production environments is in parity with your production environments. Use dashboards to compare the environments and verify that the code and infrastructure changes you make are correct across them, and eliminate any anomalies before pushing code to production. 2. Add automated deployment markers It’s important to track deployments and how the impact of the code and infrastructure changes you make affect customer experience. APM’s deployment markers feature allows you to record deployments for each application. A deployment marker is an event indicating that a deployment happened, and it's paired with metadata available from your SCM system (such metadata typically includes the user, revision, change-log, etc.). APM displays a vertical line, or “marker”, on charts and graphs at the deployment event’s timestamp. When you hover over the line, APM displays the associated metadata for that deployment. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview APM also provides a chronological list of deployments of your application, and additional metrics, such as error rate and Apdex from the time of the deployment, are available as well. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Deployments Tracking deployments is an invaluable way to determine the root cause of immediate, long-term, or gradual degradations in your application. Tip New Relic recommends that you make POST requests to the New Relic REST API as the final step of a successful CI/CD deployment as described in the API documentation. The following tools have integrations or plugins available to help automate this: Chef (see newrelic_depoyment) Jenkins Ansible 3. Test your pipeline with Infrastructure An important part of a successful DevOps transformation is a cultural shift toward smaller, more frequent changes to your code and infrastructure. After you complete the first two steps of this tutorial, begin to test and gather appropriate performance insights about your deployment pipeline to more clearly understand the impact of the changes you make. Code changes should be as small as possible in terms of the number of lines of code and source files you change. Changes should also involve as few team members as possible. This makes it much easier to identify issue owners and determine root causes if errors occur. Similarly, infrastructure changes should also have as small a footprint as possible to minimize the number of applications affected by each change. New Relic Infrastructure helps you see when an infrastructure change has caused a spike in issues, as shown in the following example: one.newrelic.com/apm > Infrastructure > Hosts For cloud infrastructure changes or larger code changes, consider using a blue/green deployment strategy. APM supports multiple app names which fits this model quite nicely. To implement this strategy: Deploy a version of your application to existing infrastructure using a rollup app name that signifies it as the “blue” version (or control version). Deploy a new version of your application to a subset of the infrastructure (or an alternate set of infrastructure) with a rollup name that signifies this as the “green” version (or experimental version). Ensure that traffic is routed appropriately between both versions. Compare established KPI dashboards of both versions against one another. Optimize the new version accordingly to meet your KPI targets. When you’re satisfied with the application’s performance, deploy the new version across your infrastructure using the original app name, and consider this the new baseline for any future changes you'll make to the application.",

      "body": "Successfully scaling DevOps requires a robust understanding of dependencies across application teams and related services. Use New Relics service maps to discover and mitigate risky dependencies from upstream and downstream services. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you’ve completed the previous DevOps procedures. 1. Analyze dependencies with service maps Use service maps for each application and note any dependent systems and transactions. New Relic recommends that you start by viewing the entire architecture using the Discover your environment option. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list This initial view shows all applications that are configured in your account. Applications that have violated a warning threshold are shown in yellow, and those with an active alert are shown in red. Healthy applications appear in green. New Relic uses a bold line to map applications to the services (such as databases) they connect to. Familiarize yourself with these maps to see how applications and their services fit together. Take note of which applications have the most dependencies and which rely on the same dependency, such as an API. Click an application to see high level metrics about that app, including throughput, response time, Apdex score, and error rate for the last 30 minutes. Tracking throughput is a good way to determine which of your applications are serving the most traffic. After looking at the architecture as a whole, review the applications that have the most dependencies. Select the App/Services list to see a full list of your applications. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list In this example, we’ve chosen Tower-Chicago from the App/Services list. All of the traffic being sent to Tower-Chicago is coming from Proxy-East. In this case, Tower-Chicago is showing 48.3 requests per minute, or 11.3% of the 426 requests per minute flowing through Proxy-East. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps > App/Service list In most cases, the separate applications and services represented in service maps are created and maintained by separate teams. This exercise of walking through the dependencies of your architecture should involve representatives from each of those teams. Teams should work together to ask questions such as: How critical is this particular dependency? What would happen if it were to go down? What happened last time it went down? Was there a revenue loss? 2. Identify back-end application dependency risks Once you’ve analyzed your applications’ dependencies, you’ll want to examine the quality of dependency execution. For example, is the dependency stable and predictable for each application or transaction you’ve identified? To do this, you’ll first need to gather as much information as you can about the applications from New Relic Insights, which helps you analyze data that is collected about the applications in more detail. Here is an example NRQL query to further analyze back-end service performance: SELECT count(appName)/30 as 'Throughput', apdex(duration), average(duration), stddev(duration), max(duration), count(error_type), uniquecount(host) FROM Transaction FACET appName SINCE 30 MINUTES AGO Copy This query shows you each application’s request per minute (throughput), Apdex score, and an overview of how the application is performing overall (through the standard deviation calculation, in which lower numbers are generally better). It also shows errors for the time period and the number of hosts on which the application is running. insights.newrelic.com > query results Next, gather information on incidents and events related to the services from New Relic Alerts: Click Alerts > Incidents > All Incidents. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents > All Incidents Click Alerts > Events > All Events. alerts.newrelic.com > Incidents > All Events Tip Using webhooks to send alert events to New Relic Insights, allows you to supplement your dashboards with Alerts data. The process is outlined in this community discussion post. Here is a simplified example of the results of this exercise: Application Number of dependencies RPM Hosts APDEX (avg) Last outage TTR (hrs) Routing Service 10 983 4 .93 2/19/18 .75 Tower Austin 1 58 1 .95 10/11/17 1.5 Proxy-East 11 498 4 .92 1/4/18 .25 Proxy-West 11 495 4 .97 12/3/17 .25 WebPortal 7 396 8 .98 4/1/18 2.5 Supplement this data with the data that your teams know about your service and that you gathered from the dependency exercise in step 1, and use that data to develop hypotheses about the highest risk areas in your services that should be mitigated. 3. Identify front-end dependency risk Once you’ve analyzed back-end dependencies, explore front-end dependencies. This is a critical step because as you walk higher up the stack and closer to the user, you will likely have more dependencies and abstractions. Service maps seamlessly integrate data from browser monitoring and mobile monitoring to help you understand the dependencies from front-end user interfaces to back-end services. one.newrelic.com > Service Maps Use the service map view to drill into front-end dependencies, and execute a similar exercise to the one you executed for back-end dependencies. This exercise will again expose data to help you identify risk areas you should address and optimize. We recommend that you conduct the analysis with user interface (UI) teams so that you can also gather a complementary qualitative understanding of what the UI teams consider critical based on their experience. A ranking from the UI teams of the most critical dependency is a useful output of this work. 4. Identify Microservice Dependencies If you are using microservices, you can have dozens, if not hundreds, of services that are calling each other. Use Distributed Tracing to see how all those services connect together and how your requests flow through those different services. Distributed tracing lets you see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system. A distributed trace is composed of multiple \"spans,\" which represent time spent in services or resources of those services. Click on the Distributed tracing menu in APM left nav. You can see “trace listing” view where you’ll be able to quickly identify slow traces and traces with errors. The scatter plot lets you easily see outliers. Below that are the trace summaries, click on a trace to see details. Dive into distributed traces to see how long each span takes. Click into each span to see historical performance charts and associated attributes that layer in the context you need to understand and troubleshoot issues. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Distributed tracing This rounds out your list of dependencies. 5. Create an action plan for risk mitigation Once you’ve analyzed the dependencies across your application from both front-end and back-end services, create an action plan to reduce dependency risks and achieve your service level objectives (SLO). As you prioritize these next steps, we recommend you keep these four principles in mind: Understand your risk tolerance. It’s helpful to have a clear picture of your tolerance for risk, which ideally should be informed by your service level objectives (refer to the Establish Objectives and Baselines tutorial for more information). Set an alert policy to monitor dependencies that you’ve determined have a high relationship to SLO achievement. Minimize dependencies. The simpler you keep your code, the less functions you'll have referring to other modules. Removing unnecessary complexity is an important way to ensure you have a maintainable system that meets your customers’ expectations. Localize dependencies. For the code you write, package together functions that depend on each other whenever possible. Stabilize dependencies. When dependencies are unavoidable, mitigate risks by ensuring these dependencies point to modules that are the least likely to change or are easier to substitute. When your action plan is complete, monitor the results of the efforts. The efficacy of your actions to resolve dependency risks should ultimately be measured by your SLOs",

Using too few resources in key areas can lead to errors or performance problems. Using too many resources can lead to unneeded costs. For example, you may find that you can redistribute application instances to hosts that have extra memory and CPU resources, and terminate or repurpose the hosts those instances came from. Use Infrastructure to ensure that your team is providing the right amount of compute power to meet customer expectations at appropriate costs. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you have reviewed New Relic's Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. 1. Evaluate your environment's current efficiency Use the Cluster Explorer to observe performance and dependencies across any Kubernetes environment, and to troubleshoot failures, bottlenecks, and other abnormal behavior—helping ensure that their applications are always available, running fast, and doing what they’re supposed to do. You get an overall view of the health of each cluster, and can drill down as needed for details on the state of a Kubernetes object, including a view of key metrics and logs. Start at the outer ring to view nodes of the cluster, with each node displaying CPU, memory, and storage performance metrics that provide at-a-glance understanding of the node’s overall health. Specify a lower and upper RAM and CPU limits for each container using requests and limits. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts: To evaluate your operating environment's efficiency, review the Infrastructure metrics (including averages that show as dotted lines), watch for outliers, and expand and sort the table's Memory used column. If you are using on-premise hosts (or Docker without Kubernetes), you can see the health of your hosts and containers in Infrastructure. Again, focus on CPU %, Load Average and Memory Used %. These metrics provide a good overview of your environment’s capacity. 2. Identify underutilized hosts and applications As you identify hosts that have extra capacity, start with memory usage, as that is a common limiting factor: From the Infrastructure Hosts page, expand [Expand icon] the table, then sort the Memory used column in descending order. To identify good redistribution candidates, look for hosts using a small amount of memory that have a small number of applications deployed on them. Also consider the health of an application before moving it to a different host. To ensure that an application has predictable performance, use APM. From the APM Overview page, track metrics for Apdex (user satisfaction) and average response time for transactions. Review other app performance details from the APM UI. Stabilize applications that are volatile before introducing other variables into their runtime performance. 3. Use the Cloud Optimize Nerdpack Cloud Optimize analyzes your cloud environment using the New Relic Infrastructure cloud integrations(for AWS, GCP, Azure and Alibaba). It compares the size of your instances to their utilization, identifying resources that are sized larger than needed. Cloud Optimize will estimate your savings by optimizing resource size.

      "body": "Incident orchestration is the alignment of teams, tools, and processes to prepare for incidents and outages in your software. The goal is to provide your teams a predictable framework and process to: Maximize efficiency in communication and effort. Minimize the overall impact to your business. Prerequisites Before starting this tutorial, be sure to complete these New Relic tutorials: Establish team dashboards Set up proactive alerting 1. Assign first responders to team dashboards Recommendation: For each team dashboard, make sure: It has an owner who assumes responsibility for the health of the applications and features it monitors. There is no ambiguity about who is responsible for attending to and resolving an alert condition. This policy will vary between organizations depending on size, structure, and culture. For example, some teams may prefer to assign dashboards and alerts based on de-facto features or application ownership. Other teams may prefer to adopt an on-call rotation (often referred to as \"pager duty\"). In on-call rotations, designated team members handle all first-line incident responses, and they resolve or delegate responsibilities based on predetermined incident thresholds. 2. Determine incident thresholds for alert conditions For each of your applications: Identify the thresholds for what is officially considered an incident. As you create alert policies with New Relic Alerts, make sure each set of threshold criteria is context-dependent. Document incident evaluation and known remediation procedures in runbooks. Include links to your runbooks when you define conditions and thresholds for your alert policies. For instance, a certain alert condition may be dismissable during low-traffic periods but require active remediation during peak hours. 3. Ensure alerts have auditable notification channels Recommendation: Make sure that communications during critical incidents take place in easily accessible and highly visible channels. A group chat room dedicated to incident communication is usually a great choice. This allows all stakeholders to participate or observe and provides a chronology of notifications, key decisions, and actions for postmortem analysis. Use any of the available notification channels in New Relic Alerts. For example, to set up a notification channel in Slack: Make sure your organization has completed New Relic's integration requirements with Slack. In the Slack app, select the dropdown in the top-left corner of the app, and select Customize Slack. Click Configure apps. From the list of app integrations, select New Relic. Expand the instructions for New Relic Alerts, and follow the steps to configure notifications from New Relic. 4. Automate triage and resolution steps Automation of simple or repeatable incident response tasks will increase efficiency and minimize the impact of incidents. With proper automation in place, you can disable or isolate faulty application components as soon as an alert threshold is reached, rather than after a notification has been issued. For example, a team managing an application for a digital media company wants to be able to remove commenting abilities from the website if the system has errors. In this case, they could: Add an endpoint to their front-end web application that will toggle a feature flag enabling or disabling the UI components associated with posting comments on an article. Create an alert policy with a threshold set on the sustained error rate in the commenting service. Assign a webhook notification channel that will send a POST request to this endpoint, as well as to the standard team notification channels. In this scenario, errors in the commenting system will trigger the webhook and remove the commenting UI from the website. Users can still use core functionality of the site without seeing errors generated by the commenting service. The application will maintain a stable but degraded state, allowing the team to focus on recovery without the pressure of preventing users from accessing the site. You can also use webhooks to create issues and action items in ticketing systems that have REST APIs, such as Zendesk. Use New Relic Alerts to create a webhook notification channel, and customize the webhook payload as needed. New Relic also provides integrations for some common ticketing systems. You can use any of the available integrations to file tickets from APM.",

      "body": "The term alerting often carries some negative connotations: many developers correlate alerting with errors, mistakes, and ongoing issues. However, developers who are proactive about alerting, know they don't have to stare at dashboards all day because effective alerts tell them when to check in. Well-defined alerts help you understand the health of your systems, so you can respond to performance problems before they affect your customers. Further, a focused alerts policy helps you pinpoint any degradation that could impact performance in your application or environment. With proactive alerting, you'll decrease user-reported incidents, and your teams will spend less time firefighting and more time deploying significant changes to your product. After you define the right alerts, proper incident orchestration aligns your teams, tools, and processes to prepare for incidents and outages in your software. The goal is to provide your teams a predictable framework and process to: Maximize efficiency in communication and effort. Minimize the overall impact to your business. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you have: Instrumented your applications in New Relic. Reviewed the Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. Optionally added custom attributes and events. 1. Define policies Define required alerting policies based on SLOs. A service level objective (SLO) is an agreed upon means of measuring the performance of your service. The SLO defines a target value of a specified quantitative measure, which is called a service level indicator (SLI). Examples of service level indicators could be average response time, response time percentile, and application availability. SLOs would then clarify a target value for those SLIs such as: Average response time should be less than 200 ms. 95% of requests should be completed within 250 ms. Availability of the service should be 99.99%. These SLOs can also be logically grouped together to provide an overall boolean indicator of whether the service is meeting expectations or not (for example, 95% of requests completed within 250 ms AND availability is 99.99%), which can be helpful for alerting purposes. Use these SLIs as key performance indicators (KPIs) so your team and organization can measure your service and ensure it's meeting customer expectations. By breaking down the quantitative performance metrics that are required of your services, you can then identify what kinds of alerts you should set for each. For instance, you could set an alert to notify you if web transaction times go above half a millisecond, or if the error rate goes higher than 0.20%. However, not every SLO needs to become an alert. A strong alerting strategy takes SLOs and creates a set of simple, actionable alerts. New Relic often finds that our most mature customers set fewer alerts in general and focus those alerts on a core set of metrics that indicate when their customer experience is truly degraded. As a result, New Relic customers often use Apdex as part of their alerting strategy to align alerts with signs of degraded user satisfaction. As you design your alerting strategy, keep this question in mind: “If the customer isn’t impacted, is it worth waking someone up?” Example questions and KPI solutions For a simple framework of areas to set alerts for, use the following questions and advised metrics and KPIs: Questions Metrics and KPIs Are we open for business? Use browser monitoring and APM to alert on site availability. How's our underlying infrastructure? Set KPIs for key hardware, network, and storage components. How's the health of our application? Track metrics for JVM performance, queuing, caching, and similar dependencies. How’s the overall quality of our application? Use an Apdex score to quickly access an application’s quality. How are our customers doing? Consider real end-user metrics (browser or APM), synthetic users (Synthetics), and Apdex scores. How's our overall business doing? Focus on key transactions within an application, and tie them to expected business outcomes to illustrate correlation between your application and business performance. 2. Set specific alerts Set specific alerts for performance, correctness, throughput, availability, and dependencies With New Relic you can set alerts on your instrumented applications, end-user experience, infrastructure, databases, and more. New Relic will alert you if your site's availability dips or if your error rate spikes above acceptable levels, as defined by your SLOs. You can set warning thresholds to monitor issues that may be approaching a critical severity but don't yet warrant a pager notification. Setting thresholds for when alerts should notify teams can be challenging. Thresholds that are too tight will create alert fatigue while thresholds that are too loose will lead to unhappy customers. Baseline alerts allow you to set dynamic thresholds for alerts based on historical performance. Use baselines to tune your alert to the right threshold. For example, an alert in APM can notify incident response teams if web transaction times deviate from historical performance for an allotted amount of time. alerts.newrelic.com > (selected alert policy) > (selected alert condition) > Define thresholds You can set this same kind of alert in browser to catch sub-optimal performance. In the following example, we've set both a warning and a violation for throughput: alerts.newrelic.com > (selected alert policy) > (selected alert condition) > Define thresholds As you develop smaller, independent services running on increasingly ephemeral architectures, your environments become significantly more complex. Visibility into outliers can be an important tool for understanding likely performance issues. You should set alerts to automatically fire when you have an outlier, which can indicate misbehaving hosts, load balancers, or apps. For example, a load balancer divides web traffic across five different servers. You can set an alert based on a NRQL query and receive a notification if any server starts getting significantly more or less traffic than the other servers. Here is an example chart: And here's a sample NRQL query: SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample WHERE apmApplicationNames = 'MY-APP-NAME' FACET hostname Copy Now you have set static, baseline, and outlier alerts. This can provide a comprehensive awareness of your ecosystem. Refer to the New Relic Alerts documentation for more details about optimizing your alerts. 3. Identify groups Identify groups to alert, set broadcasting methods, and assign first responders to team dashboards Alerting without the proper broadcasting methods leaves you vulnerable. Your alerting strategy should include a notification channel to ensure the appropriate teams are notified if your application or architecture encounters issues. New Relic has many notification integrations, but we recommend that you start simple and add more complexity later. We recommend that you first send alerts to a group chat channel (for example, using Slack or PagerDuty). Evaluate these alerts in real time for several weeks to understand which alerts are indicative of important or problematic issues. These are the types of alerts that warrant waking someone up. Recommendation: For each team dashboard, make sure: It has an owner who assumes responsibility for the health of the applications and features it monitors. There is no ambiguity about who is responsible for attending to and resolving an alert condition. This policy will vary between organizations depending on size, structure, and culture. For example, some teams may prefer to assign dashboards and alerts based on de-facto features or application ownership. Other teams may prefer to adopt an on-call rotation (often referred to as pager duty). In on-call rotations, designated team members handle all first-line incident responses, and they resolve or delegate responsibilities based on predetermined incident thresholds. 4. Determine thresholds Determine incident thresholds for alert conditions For each of your applications: Identify the thresholds for what is officially considered an incident. Make sure each set of threshold criteria is context-dependent. Document incident evaluation and known remediation procedures in runbooks. Include links to your runbooks when you define conditions and thresholds for your alert policies. For instance, a certain alert condition may be dismissable during low-traffic periods but require active remediation during peak hours. 5. Set notification channels Ensure alerts have auditable notification channels Make sure that communications during critical incidents take place in easily accessible and highly visible channels. A group chat room dedicated to incident communication is usually a great choice. This allows all stakeholders to participate or observe and provides a chronology of notifications, key decisions, and actions for postmortem analysis. Use any of the available notification channels in New Relic Alerts. For example, to set up a notification channel in Slack: Make sure your organization has completed New Relic's integration requirements with Slack. In the Slack app, select the dropdown in the top-left corner of the app, and select Customize Slack. Click Configure apps. From the list of app integrations, select New Relic. Expand the instructions for New Relic Alerts, and follow the steps to configure notifications from New Relic. 6. Automate resolution Automate triage and resolution steps Automation of simple or repeatable incident response tasks will increase efficiency and minimize the impact of incidents. With proper automation in place, you can disable or isolate faulty application components as soon as an alert threshold is reached, rather than after a notification has been issued. For example, a team managing an application for a digital media company wants to be able to remove commenting abilities from the website if the system has errors. In this case, they could: Add an endpoint to their front-end web application that will toggle a feature flag enabling or disabling the UI components associated with posting comments on an article. Create an alert policy with a threshold set on the sustained error rate in the commenting service. Assign a webhook notification channel that will send a POST request to this endpoint, as well as to the standard team notification channels. In this scenario, errors in the commenting system will trigger the webhook and remove the commenting UI from the website. Users can still use core functionality of the site without seeing errors generated by the commenting service. The application will maintain a stable but degraded state, allowing the team to focus on recovery without the pressure of preventing users from accessing the site. You can also use webhooks to create issues and action items in ticketing systems that have REST APIs, such as Zendesk. Use New Relic Alerts to create a webhook notification channel, and customize the webhook payload as needed. New Relic also provides integrations for common ticketing systems. You can use any of these integrations to file tickets from APM. 7. Establish reviews Establish a post mortem process After the incident has been resolved, key stakeholders and participants must capture accurate and thorough documentation of the incident. At a minimum, we recommend that the retro documentation includes: A root cause analysis A chronology and summary of remediation steps and their result, whether they were successful or not A measure of the impact to the business in terms of user experience and financial losses, if possible Recommendations for system or feature improvements to prevent a recurrence Recommendations for process and communication improvements Store post mortem reports in a highly visible, searchable repository, such as a shared drive folder or wiki. Culturally, it's essential that this process focuses on constructive learning and improvement rather than punishment or blame. Example post mortem report Here is a brief example of a post mortem report: Post mortem Comments Date March 1, 2018 Executive summary From approximately 1:45PM until 2:30PM, users could not add items to their carts, which prevented any checkouts from occurring during the incident period. Root cause We determined that a change was made to the CSS rules on the product detail page that effectively disabled the Add to cart button. Timeline 1:50PM: Successful checkouts < 10 for 5 minutes alert triggered; assigned to Alice. 1:55PM: After reviewing the ecommerce team dashboard, Alice determined that the threshold was breached immediately following a deploy by Bob. She notified him of the incident. 2:00PM: Alice and Bob began troubleshooting. Attempts at recreating the issue in production were successful. 2:20PM: Bob determined that his change to the CSS on the product detail page disabled the Add to cart button. He deployed a hotfix. 2:30PM: Functionality was restored and the incident was resolved. Impact No checkouts were completed during the duration of the incident. Our typical revenue for a Thursday during this timeframe is $30,000. Recommendations We have been discussing implementing New Relic Synthetics for awhile now. If we had a Synthetic check on the checkout process, this issue would have been detected immediately. We should also implement more thorough unit tests in the front-end web app. 8. Fine-tune process Fine-tune alerts and thresholds As you use New Relic to optimize your application and infrastructure performance, tighten your New Relic Alerts policy conditions to keep pace with your improved performance. When rolling out new code or modifications that could negatively impact performance over a period of time, loosen your threshold conditions to allow for these short-term changes. For instance, we recommend using pre-established baselines and thresholds to increase efficiency during high-impact times for your business, such as annual events and major releases. Fine-tuning gives you the flexibility you need to increase efficiencies and extend your notification channels. As noted earlier, we recommend you start with a group chat service when you first establish notifications. Once you've identified other tools you'd like to integrate with, set up a notification channel to maintain your momentum. Tools such as xMatters and PagerDuty provide popular integrations, but don't overlook simple methods, such as webhooks. The goal is to continuously improve your alerting scheme. Be sure to check your alerts and confirm that they're firing regularly and are still relevant for your customer satisfaction metrics. Use the New Relic platform to create dashboards centered around alerts and incidents for the most common policy conditions and violations. insights.newrelic.com > All dashboards > (selected dashboard) Use the New Relic query language and the Insights query API to create your dashboards. The dashboard above was created using the following NRQL queries. It's recommended you recreate them as needed for your alerting dashboards. Incidents by condition: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state = 'open' FACET condition_name SINCE 1 week ago Copy Incidents by policy: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME where current_state = 'open' FACET policy_name SINCE 60 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Alert trends over time: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state IS NOT NULL FACET policy_name SINCE 1 week ago TIMESERIES Copy Incident details: SELECT timestamp, incident_id, policy_name, condition_name, details, severity FROM ALERT_NAME SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 40 Copy Visualizing this data provides a resource you can share with others to refine the alerts and thresholds you're using. Expert tip In addition to instrumenting and measuring application and infrastructure metrics, mature DevOps organizations often measure and optimize the efficiency of incident response processes. For example, you can use webhooks to send alert events to New Relic Insights. This allows you to supplement your team dashboards with New Relic Alerts data.",

      "body": "Proper instrumentation gives teams full visibility into the impact of the changes they make in a system. Capturing tangible, measurable metrics from before and after each change allows teams to optimize changes in isolation and reduce the impact to other work happening in the system. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, complete the Establish objectives and baselines. 1. Integrate measurements into your development process With appropriate measurements incorporated into all phases of your development cycle, you can surface errors and performance issues before your customers uncover them. As your application teams plan their work, use your KPI dashboards in daily stand-ups and other planning meetings to analyze necessary debugging work, assess whether recent deployments were successful, and prioritize other work efforts. When development and operations teams use dashboards during planning and discussions, they ensure that they're consistently incorporating feedback about customer experiences and reliability risks into their development efforts. For proper testing, ensure that instrumentation in your pre-production environments is in parity with your production environments. Use dashboards to compare the environments and verify that the code and infrastructure changes you make across them are correct, and eliminate any anomalies before pushing code to production. Beyond using instrumentation to measure software performance, also use it to analyze team efficiency. For example, with your alerts data, use NRQL and external integrations to calculate mean time to repair (MTTR) by subtracting the difference in event timestamps as the current state of each event changes from OPEN to ACKNOWLEDGED to CLOSED. Or push events into Insights from a source code management (SCM) system like GitHub, and calculate the amount of time it takes a code change to go live by comparing the timestamp of a commit event to that of a deploy event. Plotted over time, this could become a KPI in a DevOps transformation. 2. Add automated deployment markers It's important to track deployments and the impact code and infrastructure changes have on your end-user experience. Using deployment markers in APM, you can record deployments for each application. A deployment marker is an event indicating that a deployment happened, and it's paired with metadata available from your SCM system (for example, the user, revision, or change-log). APM displays a vertical line, or “marker,” on charts and graphs at the deployment event's timestamp. When you hover over the line, APM displays the associated metadata for that deployment. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview APM also provides a chronological list of deployments of your application. Additional metrics, such as error rate and Apdex from the time of the deployment, are available as well. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Deployments Tracking deployments is a valuable way to determine the root cause of immediate, long-term, or gradual degradations in your application. New Relic recommends that you make POST requests to the New Relic REST API as the final step of a successful CI/CD deployment as described in the API documentation. The following tools have integrations or plugins available to help automate this: Chef (see newrelic_deployment) Jenkins Ansible Puppet 3. Test your pipeline with Infrastructure An important part of optimizing your cloud native environment is a making a cultural shift toward smaller, more frequent changes to your code and infrastructure. After you complete the first two steps of this tutorial, begin to test and gather appropriate performance insights about your deployment pipeline to more clearly understand the impact of the changes you make. Code changes should be as small as possible in terms of the number of lines of code and source files you change. Changes should also involve as few team members as possible. This makes it much easier to identify issue owners and determine root causes if errors occur. Similarly, infrastructure changes should also have as small a footprint as possible to minimize the number of applications affected by each change. New Relic Infrastructure helps you see when an infrastructure change has caused a spike in issues, as shown in the following example: one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts For cloud infrastructure changes or larger code changes, consider using a blue/green deployment strategy. APM supports multiple app names, which is a good fit for this model. To implement this strategy: Deploy a version of your application to existing infrastructure using a rollup app name that signifies it as the “blue” version (or control version). Deploy a new version of your application to a subset of the infrastructure (or an alternate set of infrastructure) with a rollup name that signifies this as the “green” version (or experimental version). Ensure that traffic is routed appropriately between both versions. Compare established KPI dashboards of both versions against one another. Optimize the new version accordingly to meet your KPI targets. When you're satisfied with the application's performance, deploy the new version across your infrastructure using the original app name, and consider this the new baseline for any future changes you'll make to the application.",

      "body": "In the cloud, it's important to look regularly and closely at how your applications and services are architected and utilized. It's the best way to identify opportunities that will let you right-size your instances, fine tune your databases, modify your storage usage, better configure your load balancers, or even re-architect your applications. For example, if you have a set of 20 instances all running at 10% CPU usage, you might consider using smaller instances or consolidating more work onto those instances. This kind of thinking about your cloud utilization and spend will help you optimize your environment and save money quickly. Optimizing your cloud architecture has three main goals: Improve performance, availability, and end-user experience by taking better advantage of cloud services Optimize your cloud spend, striking the delicate balance between cost and performance Capture business and technical metrics that help justify your current cloud spend that can be referenced as justification for a larger cloud budget as growth dictates In this tutorial, we'll show you how to use the New Relic platform to capture all the data you should leverage to optimize your cloud architecture and spend. 1. Instrument your application and cloud environment Make sure the following products and integrations are instrumented: Instrument Details Install Infrastructure Instrument infrastructure: If you haven't already done so, review the requirements for the Infrastructure agent. Infrastructure comes with several types of integrations, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and on-host integrations. After you've installed the Infrastructure agent on your host(s), you'll immediately have access to the broad spectrum of metrics the agent collects out-of-the-box. Install the APM agent Instrument your applications with APM. Doing so will let you monitor how your applications are performing while you are optimizing the underlying cloud services. That way, you can confirm that your changes to the infrastructure are in fact improving application performance. Configure the AWS integration New Relic Infrastructure's Amazon integrations let you monitor your AWS data in several New Relic products, including Infrastructure, dashboards, and New Relic Alerts. Connect AWS Billing If you are hosted in an AWS environment, New Relic can help you monitor your cloud spend with our AWS Billing integration. To leverage New Relic's AWS Billing integration, follow the procedures in the Connect AWS Billing documentation 2. Create dashboards to display baseline infrastructure metrics; include AWS budgets if available Dashboards lets you write powerful custom queries about your data and visualize the results in widgets displayed on a common dashboard. You can also feed the results of your queries directly into New Relic Alerts, where you can get immediate notifications on any deviation identified. For this step, you should display baseline infrastructure metrics related to performance and usage (CPU, memory, disk, database, etc.). Include AWS Budgets if available. To get you started, here are ways to use Insights dashboards to visualize your AWS cloud utilization and spend data: This dashboard shows data broken out by the applications and budgets you set up in the AWS budgeting area. Create individual dashboards for each application, and then collect those dashboards into a single “data app,” as shown here. This AWS Production Overview data app displays a set of widgets relevant to an AWS production budget. Data apps are great for presentations where you want to step through a series of topics and also provide a clear overview of an entire environment or service. Create dashboards for each level of your organization Whether you're a developer, operator, or executive, having information about your cloud utilization can help you optimize your cloud environment: Developers: Understanding what applications currently cost can help developers configure applications to use more services more efficiently. For example, could developers cut cloud costs using AWS Lambda or properly sized instances? Operators: Monitoring application utilization allows operators to catch possible overruns due to mis-configured services. For example, is the ops team's auto-scaling configuration scaling down properly? Executives: An overall view of both fore-casted and actual cloud spend, for individual applications, per region, and overall totals, can help executives make better business decisions. Use New Relic to keep track of your cloud spend, and make sure your teams get alerted immediately when you exceed thresholds. 3. Identify resources for optimization This step shows you how to use the metrics New Relic has captured to determine which resources to optimize. In the sample dashboard above, the CPU-usage widget on the left reveals that this application uses many instances sizes. Note that the “c4.xlarge” instance (in coral) consistently consumes only around 20% CPU capacity. However, when you analyze the c4.xlarge Memory usage in the center widget (light green), you'll see that memory usage for this instance ranges from 20% to 80%. This suggests that the application is more memory-intensive than CPU-intensive. In this case, the instance type should be changed from a compute-optimized instance to one that is memory-optimized. (Note: the chart on the right of the dashboard can be used to monitor the application's average response time as you make these optimizations.) This is just one example of how to identify cloud-based resources that could be candidates for optimization. Now that you've identified architecture for optimization, go ahead and do so. Whether you right-size your instances, fine tune your databases, modify your storage usage, better configure your load balancers, or even re-architect your applications, in the end your goal is to be able to compare your new, optimized architecture against the baselines you captured in Step 2. For more about baselines please review the Establish Objectives & Baselines tutorial. 4. Optional: Set up alerts You can create an alert condition for NRQL queries. Be sure to reference the complete documentation as needed. In the data app for the AWS production budget introduced in Step 2, this was one of the widgets: Here is the query that we used to create that widget: SELECT latest(`provider.actualAmount`) as '$ Actual', latest(`provider.forecastedAmount`) as '$ Forecast', max(`provider.limitAmount`) as '$ Limit' FROM FinanceSample WHERE provider = 'BillingBudget' AND `provider.budgetName` = '[Your Cloud Budget]' Copy If you can write queries on your data and show them in Insights, then you can easily use them to generate Alert conditions. Baseline queries New Relic also lets you write “baseline queries” against your data. These are queriesy you write without setting hard limits on the results. Rather, you let New Relic Applied Intelligence “machine-learn” your performance data, and then alert you when your data strays too far outside of your baseline numbers. To create a baseline query, head over the the Alert console, go into Alert policies, and add a New alert policy. Then follow these steps: Create alert policy. Give your policy a concise and descriptive name and select an Incident Preference. Then select Create alert policy. Create a condition. Select NRQL Define your query, and decide how restrictively Applied Intelligence should analyze your data using a simple slider and visualization based on your recent performance. The slider at the bottom of the chart either increases or decreases the gray band around your budget threshold (the blue line). The setting shown would have resulted in zero violations based on recent data, and that is what you're looking for. However, if that blue line spikes up or down out of the gray band, New Relic will immediately notify you. Using New Relic Applied Intelligence is a great way to help you proactively learn about your cloud spending or about any of your performance data.

      "body": "The term alerting often carries some negative connotations: many developers correlate alerting with errors, mistakes, and ongoing issues. However, developers who are proactive about alerting, know they don't have to stare at dashboards all day because effective alerts tell them when to check in. Well-defined alerts help you understand the health of your systems, so you can respond to performance problems before they affect your customers. Further, a focused alerts policy helps you pinpoint any degradation that could impact performance in your application or environment. With proactive alerting, you'll decrease user-reported incidents, and your teams will spend less time firefighting and more time deploying significant changes to your product. After you define the right alerts, proper incident orchestration aligns your teams, tools, and processes to prepare for incidents and outages in your software. The goal is to provide your teams a predictable framework and process to: Maximize efficiency in communication and effort. Minimize the overall impact to your business. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you have: Instrumented your applications in New Relic. Reviewed the Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. Optionally added custom attributes and events. 1. Define policies Define required alerting policies based on SLOs. A service level objective (SLO) is an agreed upon means of measuring the performance of your service. The SLO defines a target value of a specified quantitative measure, which is called a service level indicator (SLI). Examples of service level indicators could be average response time, response time percentile, and application availability. SLOs would then clarify a target value for those SLIs such as: Average response time should be less than 200 ms. 95% of requests should be completed within 250 ms. Availability of the service should be 99.99%. These SLOs can also be logically grouped together to provide an overall boolean indicator of whether the service is meeting expectations or not (for example, 95% of requests completed within 250 ms AND availability is 99.99%), which can be helpful for alerting purposes. Use these SLIs as key performance indicators (KPIs) so your team and organization can measure your service and ensure it's meeting customer expectations. By breaking down the quantitative performance metrics that are required of your services, you can then identify what kinds of alerts you should set for each. For instance, you could set an alert to notify you if web transaction times go above half a millisecond, or if the error rate goes higher than 0.20%. However, not every SLO needs to become an alert. A strong alerting strategy takes SLOs and creates a set of simple, actionable alerts. New Relic often finds that our most mature customers set fewer alerts in general and focus those alerts on a core set of metrics that indicate when their customer experience is truly degraded. As a result, New Relic customers often use Apdex as part of their alerting strategy to align alerts with signs of degraded user satisfaction. As you design your alerting strategy, keep this question in mind: “If the customer isn’t impacted, is it worth waking someone up?” Example questions and KPI solutions For a simple framework of areas to set alerts for, use the following questions and advised metrics and KPIs: Questions Metrics and KPIs Are we open for business? Use browser monitoring and APM to alert on site availability. How's our underlying infrastructure? Set KPIs for key hardware, network, and storage components. How's the health of our application? Track metrics for JVM performance, queuing, caching, and similar dependencies. How’s the overall quality of our application? Use an Apdex score to quickly access an application’s quality. How are our customers doing? Consider real end-user metrics (browser or APM), synthetic users (Synthetics), and Apdex scores. How's our overall business doing? Focus on key transactions within an application, and tie them to expected business outcomes to illustrate correlation between your application and business performance. 2. Set specific alerts Set specific alerts for performance, correctness, throughput, availability, and dependencies With New Relic you can set alerts on your instrumented applications, end-user experience, infrastructure, databases, and more. New Relic will alert you if your site's availability dips or if your error rate spikes above acceptable levels, as defined by your SLOs. You can set warning thresholds to monitor issues that may be approaching a critical severity but don't yet warrant a pager notification. Setting thresholds for when alerts should notify teams can be challenging. Thresholds that are too tight will create alert fatigue while thresholds that are too loose will lead to unhappy customers. Baseline alerts allow you to set dynamic thresholds for alerts based on historical performance. Use baselines to tune your alert to the right threshold. For example, an alert in APM can notify incident response teams if web transaction times deviate from historical performance for an allotted amount of time. alerts.newrelic.com > (selected alert policy) > (selected alert condition) > Define thresholds You can set this same kind of alert in browser to catch sub-optimal performance. In the following example, we've set both a warning and a violation for throughput: alerts.newrelic.com > (selected alert policy) > (selected alert condition) > Define thresholds As you develop smaller, independent services running on increasingly ephemeral architectures, your environments become significantly more complex. Visibility into outliers can be an important tool for understanding likely performance issues. You should set alerts to automatically fire when you have an outlier, which can indicate misbehaving hosts, load balancers, or apps. For example, a load balancer divides web traffic across five different servers. You can set an alert based on a NRQL query and receive a notification if any server starts getting significantly more or less traffic than the other servers. Here is an example chart: And here's a sample NRQL query: SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample WHERE apmApplicationNames = 'MY-APP-NAME' FACET hostname Copy Now you have set static, baseline, and outlier alerts. This can provide a comprehensive awareness of your ecosystem. Refer to the New Relic Alerts documentation for more details about optimizing your alerts. 3. Identify groups Identify groups to alert, set broadcasting methods, and assign first responders to team dashboards Alerting without the proper broadcasting methods leaves you vulnerable. Your alerting strategy should include a notification channel to ensure the appropriate teams are notified if your application or architecture encounters issues. New Relic has many notification integrations, but we recommend that you start simple and add more complexity later. We recommend that you first send alerts to a group chat channel (for example, using Slack or PagerDuty). Evaluate these alerts in real time for several weeks to understand which alerts are indicative of important or problematic issues. These are the types of alerts that warrant waking someone up. Recommendation: For each team dashboard, make sure: It has an owner who assumes responsibility for the health of the applications and features it monitors. There is no ambiguity about who is responsible for attending to and resolving an alert condition. This policy will vary between organizations depending on size, structure, and culture. For example, some teams may prefer to assign dashboards and alerts based on de-facto features or application ownership. Other teams may prefer to adopt an on-call rotation (often referred to as pager duty). In on-call rotations, designated team members handle all first-line incident responses, and they resolve or delegate responsibilities based on predetermined incident thresholds. 4. Determine thresholds Determine incident thresholds for alert conditions For each of your applications: Identify the thresholds for what is officially considered an incident. Make sure each set of threshold criteria is context-dependent. Document incident evaluation and known remediation procedures in runbooks. Include links to your runbooks when you define conditions and thresholds for your alert policies. For instance, a certain alert condition may be dismissable during low-traffic periods but require active remediation during peak hours. 5. Set notification channels Ensure alerts have auditable notification channels Make sure that communications during critical incidents take place in easily accessible and highly visible channels. A group chat room dedicated to incident communication is usually a great choice. This allows all stakeholders to participate or observe and provides a chronology of notifications, key decisions, and actions for postmortem analysis. Use any of the available notification channels in New Relic Alerts. For example, to set up a notification channel in Slack: Make sure your organization has completed New Relic's integration requirements with Slack. In the Slack app, select the dropdown in the top-left corner of the app, and select Customize Slack. Click Configure apps. From the list of app integrations, select New Relic. Expand the instructions for New Relic Alerts, and follow the steps to configure notifications from New Relic. 6. Automate resolution Automate triage and resolution steps Automation of simple or repeatable incident response tasks will increase efficiency and minimize the impact of incidents. With proper automation in place, you can disable or isolate faulty application components as soon as an alert threshold is reached, rather than after a notification has been issued. For example, a team managing an application for a digital media company wants to be able to remove commenting abilities from the website if the system has errors. In this case, they could: Add an endpoint to their front-end web application that will toggle a feature flag enabling or disabling the UI components associated with posting comments on an article. Create an alert policy with a threshold set on the sustained error rate in the commenting service. Assign a webhook notification channel that will send a POST request to this endpoint, as well as to the standard team notification channels. In this scenario, errors in the commenting system will trigger the webhook and remove the commenting UI from the website. Users can still use core functionality of the site without seeing errors generated by the commenting service. The application will maintain a stable but degraded state, allowing the team to focus on recovery without the pressure of preventing users from accessing the site. You can also use webhooks to create issues and action items in ticketing systems that have REST APIs, such as Zendesk. Use New Relic Alerts to create a webhook notification channel, and customize the webhook payload as needed. New Relic also provides integrations for common ticketing systems. You can use any of these integrations to file tickets from APM. 7. Establish reviews Establish a post mortem process After the incident has been resolved, key stakeholders and participants must capture accurate and thorough documentation of the incident. At a minimum, we recommend that the retro documentation includes: A root cause analysis A chronology and summary of remediation steps and their result, whether they were successful or not A measure of the impact to the business in terms of user experience and financial losses, if possible Recommendations for system or feature improvements to prevent a recurrence Recommendations for process and communication improvements Store post mortem reports in a highly visible, searchable repository, such as a shared drive folder or wiki. Culturally, it's essential that this process focuses on constructive learning and improvement rather than punishment or blame. Example post mortem report Here is a brief example of a post mortem report: Post mortem Comments Date March 1, 2018 Executive summary From approximately 1:45PM until 2:30PM, users could not add items to their carts, which prevented any checkouts from occurring during the incident period. Root cause We determined that a change was made to the CSS rules on the product detail page that effectively disabled the Add to cart button. Timeline 1:50PM: Successful checkouts < 10 for 5 minutes alert triggered; assigned to Alice. 1:55PM: After reviewing the ecommerce team dashboard, Alice determined that the threshold was breached immediately following a deploy by Bob. She notified him of the incident. 2:00PM: Alice and Bob began troubleshooting. Attempts at recreating the issue in production were successful. 2:20PM: Bob determined that his change to the CSS on the product detail page disabled the Add to cart button. He deployed a hotfix. 2:30PM: Functionality was restored and the incident was resolved. Impact No checkouts were completed during the duration of the incident. Our typical revenue for a Thursday during this timeframe is $30,000. Recommendations We have been discussing implementing New Relic Synthetics for awhile now. If we had a Synthetic check on the checkout process, this issue would have been detected immediately. We should also implement more thorough unit tests in the front-end web app. 8. Fine-tune process Fine-tune alerts and thresholds As you use New Relic to optimize your application and infrastructure performance, tighten your New Relic Alerts policy conditions to keep pace with your improved performance. When rolling out new code or modifications that could negatively impact performance over a period of time, loosen your threshold conditions to allow for these short-term changes. For instance, we recommend using pre-established baselines and thresholds to increase efficiency during high-impact times for your business, such as annual events and major releases. Fine-tuning gives you the flexibility you need to increase efficiencies and extend your notification channels. As noted earlier, we recommend you start with a group chat service when you first establish notifications. Once you've identified other tools you'd like to integrate with, set up a notification channel to maintain your momentum. Tools such as xMatters and PagerDuty provide popular integrations, but don't overlook simple methods, such as webhooks. The goal is to continuously improve your alerting scheme. Be sure to check your alerts and confirm that they're firing regularly and are still relevant for your customer satisfaction metrics. Use the New Relic platform to create dashboards centered around alerts and incidents for the most common policy conditions and violations. insights.newrelic.com > All dashboards > (selected dashboard) Use the New Relic query language and the Insights query API to create your dashboards. The dashboard above was created using the following NRQL queries. It's recommended you recreate them as needed for your alerting dashboards. Incidents by condition: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state = 'open' FACET condition_name SINCE 1 week ago Copy Incidents by policy: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME where current_state = 'open' FACET policy_name SINCE 60 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Alert trends over time: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state IS NOT NULL FACET policy_name SINCE 1 week ago TIMESERIES Copy Incident details: SELECT timestamp, incident_id, policy_name, condition_name, details, severity FROM ALERT_NAME SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 40 Copy Visualizing this data provides a resource you can share with others to refine the alerts and thresholds you're using. Expert tip In addition to instrumenting and measuring application and infrastructure metrics, mature DevOps organizations often measure and optimize the efficiency of incident response processes. For example, you can use webhooks to send alert events to New Relic Insights. This allows you to supplement your team dashboards with New Relic Alerts data.",

      "body": "Whether you've recently completed your cloud migration, have been using cloud-based services for a while, or have always been in the cloud, you may find yourself deploying modern, cutting-edge technologies and services. It's important to develop the ability to adopt new services easily and with confidence; innovation never stops for companies operating in the cloud, and a company's willingness to embrace new technology can give it a major competitive differentiator. These modern technologies could be container solutions such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Amazon AWS ECS or Fargate, for example. Or they could be serverless services such as AWS Lambda, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform Functions. They may be cloud-based databases, or any number of cloud services that abstract the service away from an operations-maintained infrastructure. In these situations, you want to monitor, query, and alert on the performance and usage metrics for both modern technologies and cloud-based services. This allows your team to deploy faster, to adopt new services with confidence, to make better business decisions, and in general to expand its technology horizons. Here are the steps to using the New Relic Platform to monitor your modern technologies and cloud services: 1. Identify services and technologies Determine the components you need to monitor by answering the following questions: What cloud-based applications do I have? What are the underlying cloud-based services, technologies, and infrastructure supporting those applications? When you have a full understanding of your architecture, you reduce the possibility of missing dependencies and new services that might impact your organization's application environment. 2. Deploy New Relic Infrastructure After reviewing the requirements for New Relic Infrastructure, install the Infrastructure agent on the hosts you identified in Step One so that you can monitor your cloud services. If you use Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for automation, you can use those tools to deploy Infrastructure agents to your hosts. 3. Configure cloud integrations As you integrate new cloud services, you can use New Relic to monitor and report data about these services; giving you a single, comprehensive overview of your entire architecture. To configure cloud service integrations, link your Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service provider account with New Relic. 4. Track data on your dashboards New Relic Infrastructure integrations auto-populate dashboards with metrics from cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP so you can track the data that is critical to your cloud adoption success. Tip If you adopt a hybrid cloud of multiple cloud providers, New Relic can provide a holistic perspective that is agnostic to cloud providers. AWS EC2 monitoring integration dashboard In this default dashboard for the AWS EC2 monitoring integration, New Relic captures metrics for EC2 instances per region, instance state, and instance type. The dashboard also shows inventory for different software packages and configurations that are installed on those instances. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Integrations > Amazon Web Services: View AWS EC2 data on the default dashboard for the AWS EC2 monitoring integration. Azure VMs monitoring integration dashboard The default Azure virtual machine integration dashboard shows data for VM sizes, VMs per region, and VMs per resource group. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Integrations > Microsoft Azure: View Azure virtual machine data on the default dashboard for the Azure VMs monitoring integration. GCP Compute Engine monitoring integration dashboard In this default dashboard for the Google Cloud Platform, New Relic captures metrics for instances per zone, instance status, firewall dropped packets, reserved cores, and disk throttled operations. The dashboard also shows inventory for different software packages and configurations that are installed on those instances. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Integrations > Google Cloud Platform: View GCP Compute Engine data on the default dashboard for the GCP Compute Engine monitoring integration. Example modern and cloud services dashboard In this example dashboard, three different cloud vendors, modern technologies, cloud services, infrastructure instance locations, and DevOps widgets are combined for an overall view. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Here is an example of an Insights dashboard with data about vendors, technologies, services, instances, and other important details for DevOps teams. 5. Add alerts for cloud-based metrics When monitoring cloud-based services, it is essential to keep track of all changes to a system by alerting on them. Integrations with New Relic Infrastructure allow you to create alerts on the metrics that are the most important to you. Here is an example of a baseline alert that will notify you based on the number of requests received on all AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ALB) systems for the ALB monitoring integration: alerts.newrelic.com > Alert policies > (selected policy) > Alert conditions: Create a NRQL baseline alert to monitor the number of requests received your ALB systems. 6. Set up additional monitoring For full-stack visibility into every aspect of your app, we recommend deploying other types of New Relic monitoring: Use APM to report application-tier performance metrics. Use browser monitoring to report front-end web metrics. Use mobile monitoring to report front-end mobile app metrics. Use synthetic monitoring to monitor websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. 7. CI/CD pipeline integration It's important to track deployments and the impact that code and infrastructure changes have on your end-user experience. APM deployment markers allow you to record deployments for each application. A deployment marker is an event indicating that a deployment happened. You can pair markers with metadata from your source code management (SCM) system ( including user IDs, revisions, and change logs.). APM displays a vertical line, or marker, on charts and graphs at the deployment event's timestamp. When you hover over the line, APM displays the associated metadata for that deployment. Tracking deployments is an invaluable way to determine the root causes of immediate, long-term, or gradual degradations in your applications. Recommendation: Make POST requests to the New Relic REST API as the final step of a successful CI/CD deployment, as described in the API documentation. The following tools have integrations or plugins available to help automate CI/CD deployments: Chef (see newrelic_deployment) Jenkins Ansible Puppet 8. AWS Lambda Monitoring New Relic One features an updated APM agent that is highly optimized from a cost and time perspective for ephemeral Lambda functions. Enable New Relic monitoring of AWS Lambda to to assess invocations, error rate, function duration, cold starts, and more. You can also take advantage of New Relic's Infrastructure integration with Lambda for additional reporting capabilities.",

      "body": "Proper instrumentation gives teams full visibility into the impact of the changes they make in a system. Capturing tangible, measurable metrics from before and after each change allows teams to optimize changes in isolation and reduce the impact to other work happening in the system. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, complete the Establish objectives and baselines. 1. Integrate measurements into your development process With appropriate measurements incorporated into all phases of your development cycle, you can surface errors and performance issues before your customers uncover them. As your application teams plan their work, use your KPI dashboards in daily stand-ups and other planning meetings to analyze necessary debugging work, assess whether recent deployments were successful, and prioritize other work efforts. When development and operations teams use dashboards during planning and discussions, they ensure that they're consistently incorporating feedback about customer experiences and reliability risks into their development efforts. For proper testing, ensure that instrumentation in your pre-production environments is in parity with your production environments. Use dashboards to compare the environments and verify that the code and infrastructure changes you make across them are correct, and eliminate any anomalies before pushing code to production. Beyond using instrumentation to measure software performance, also use it to analyze team efficiency. For example, with your alerts data, use NRQL and external integrations to calculate mean time to repair (MTTR) by subtracting the difference in event timestamps as the current state of each event changes from OPEN to ACKNOWLEDGED to CLOSED. Or push events into Insights from a source code management (SCM) system like GitHub, and calculate the amount of time it takes a code change to go live by comparing the timestamp of a commit event to that of a deploy event. Plotted over time, this could become a KPI in a DevOps transformation. 2. Add automated deployment markers It's important to track deployments and the impact code and infrastructure changes have on your end-user experience. Using deployment markers in APM, you can record deployments for each application. A deployment marker is an event indicating that a deployment happened, and it's paired with metadata available from your SCM system (for example, the user, revision, or change-log). APM displays a vertical line, or “marker,” on charts and graphs at the deployment event's timestamp. When you hover over the line, APM displays the associated metadata for that deployment. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview APM also provides a chronological list of deployments of your application. Additional metrics, such as error rate and Apdex from the time of the deployment, are available as well. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Deployments Tracking deployments is a valuable way to determine the root cause of immediate, long-term, or gradual degradations in your application. New Relic recommends that you make POST requests to the New Relic REST API as the final step of a successful CI/CD deployment as described in the API documentation. The following tools have integrations or plugins available to help automate this: Chef (see newrelic_deployment) Jenkins Ansible Puppet 3. Test your pipeline with Infrastructure An important part of optimizing your cloud native environment is a making a cultural shift toward smaller, more frequent changes to your code and infrastructure. After you complete the first two steps of this tutorial, begin to test and gather appropriate performance insights about your deployment pipeline to more clearly understand the impact of the changes you make. Code changes should be as small as possible in terms of the number of lines of code and source files you change. Changes should also involve as few team members as possible. This makes it much easier to identify issue owners and determine root causes if errors occur. Similarly, infrastructure changes should also have as small a footprint as possible to minimize the number of applications affected by each change. New Relic Infrastructure helps you see when an infrastructure change has caused a spike in issues, as shown in the following example: one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts For cloud infrastructure changes or larger code changes, consider using a blue/green deployment strategy. APM supports multiple app names, which is a good fit for this model. To implement this strategy: Deploy a version of your application to existing infrastructure using a rollup app name that signifies it as the “blue” version (or control version). Deploy a new version of your application to a subset of the infrastructure (or an alternate set of infrastructure) with a rollup name that signifies this as the “green” version (or experimental version). Ensure that traffic is routed appropriately between both versions. Compare established KPI dashboards of both versions against one another. Optimize the new version accordingly to meet your KPI targets. When you're satisfied with the application's performance, deploy the new version across your infrastructure using the original app name, and consider this the new baseline for any future changes you'll make to the application.",

      "body": "The term alerting often carries some negative connotations: many developers correlate alerting with errors, mistakes, and ongoing issues. However, developers who are proactive about alerting, know they don't have to stare at dashboards all day because effective alerts tell them when to check in. Well-defined alerts help you understand the health of your systems, so you can respond to performance problems before they affect your customers. Further, a focused alerts policy helps you pinpoint any degradation that could impact performance in your application or environment. With proactive alerting, you'll decrease user-reported incidents, and your teams will spend less time firefighting and more time deploying significant changes to your product. After you define the right alerts, proper incident orchestration aligns your teams, tools, and processes to prepare for incidents and outages in your software. The goal is to provide your teams a predictable framework and process to: Maximize efficiency in communication and effort. Minimize the overall impact to your business. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you have: Instrumented your applications in New Relic. Reviewed the Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. Optionally added custom attributes and events. 1. Define policies Define required alerting policies based on SLOs. A service level objective (SLO) is an agreed upon means of measuring the performance of your service. The SLO defines a target value of a specified quantitative measure, which is called a service level indicator (SLI). Examples of service level indicators could be average response time, response time percentile, and application availability. SLOs would then clarify a target value for those SLIs such as: Average response time should be less than 200 ms. 95% of requests should be completed within 250 ms. Availability of the service should be 99.99%. These SLOs can also be logically grouped together to provide an overall boolean indicator of whether the service is meeting expectations or not (for example, 95% of requests completed within 250 ms AND availability is 99.99%), which can be helpful for alerting purposes. Use these SLIs as key performance indicators (KPIs) so your team and organization can measure your service and ensure it's meeting customer expectations. By breaking down the quantitative performance metrics that are required of your services, you can then identify what kinds of alerts you should set for each. For instance, you could set an alert to notify you if web transaction times go above half a millisecond, or if the error rate goes higher than 0.20%. However, not every SLO needs to become an alert. A strong alerting strategy takes SLOs and creates a set of simple, actionable alerts. New Relic often finds that our most mature customers set fewer alerts in general and focus those alerts on a core set of metrics that indicate when their customer experience is truly degraded. As a result, New Relic customers often use Apdex as part of their alerting strategy to align alerts with signs of degraded user satisfaction. As you design your alerting strategy, keep this question in mind: “If the customer isn’t impacted, is it worth waking someone up?” Example questions and KPI solutions For a simple framework of areas to set alerts for, use the following questions and advised metrics and KPIs: Questions Metrics and KPIs Are we open for business? Use browser monitoring and APM to alert on site availability. How's our underlying infrastructure? Set KPIs for key hardware, network, and storage components. How's the health of our application? Track metrics for JVM performance, queuing, caching, and similar dependencies. How’s the overall quality of our application? Use an Apdex score to quickly access an application’s quality. How are our customers doing? Consider real end-user metrics (browser or APM), synthetic users (Synthetics), and Apdex scores. How's our overall business doing? Focus on key transactions within an application, and tie them to expected business outcomes to illustrate correlation between your application and business performance. 2. Set specific alerts Set specific alerts for performance, correctness, throughput, availability, and dependencies With New Relic you can set alerts on your instrumented applications, end-user experience, infrastructure, databases, and more. New Relic will alert you if your site's availability dips or if your error rate spikes above acceptable levels, as defined by your SLOs. You can set warning thresholds to monitor issues that may be approaching a critical severity but don't yet warrant a pager notification. Setting thresholds for when alerts should notify teams can be challenging. Thresholds that are too tight will create alert fatigue while thresholds that are too loose will lead to unhappy customers. Baseline alerts allow you to set dynamic thresholds for alerts based on historical performance. Use baselines to tune your alert to the right threshold. For example, an alert in APM can notify incident response teams if web transaction times deviate from historical performance for an allotted amount of time. alerts.newrelic.com > (selected alert policy) > (selected alert condition) > Define thresholds You can set this same kind of alert in browser to catch sub-optimal performance. In the following example, we've set both a warning and a violation for throughput: alerts.newrelic.com > (selected alert policy) > (selected alert condition) > Define thresholds As you develop smaller, independent services running on increasingly ephemeral architectures, your environments become significantly more complex. Visibility into outliers can be an important tool for understanding likely performance issues. You should set alerts to automatically fire when you have an outlier, which can indicate misbehaving hosts, load balancers, or apps. For example, a load balancer divides web traffic across five different servers. You can set an alert based on a NRQL query and receive a notification if any server starts getting significantly more or less traffic than the other servers. Here is an example chart: And here's a sample NRQL query: SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample WHERE apmApplicationNames = 'MY-APP-NAME' FACET hostname Copy Now you have set static, baseline, and outlier alerts. This can provide a comprehensive awareness of your ecosystem. Refer to the New Relic Alerts documentation for more details about optimizing your alerts. 3. Identify groups Identify groups to alert, set broadcasting methods, and assign first responders to team dashboards Alerting without the proper broadcasting methods leaves you vulnerable. Your alerting strategy should include a notification channel to ensure the appropriate teams are notified if your application or architecture encounters issues. New Relic has many notification integrations, but we recommend that you start simple and add more complexity later. We recommend that you first send alerts to a group chat channel (for example, using Slack or PagerDuty). Evaluate these alerts in real time for several weeks to understand which alerts are indicative of important or problematic issues. These are the types of alerts that warrant waking someone up. Recommendation: For each team dashboard, make sure: It has an owner who assumes responsibility for the health of the applications and features it monitors. There is no ambiguity about who is responsible for attending to and resolving an alert condition. This policy will vary between organizations depending on size, structure, and culture. For example, some teams may prefer to assign dashboards and alerts based on de-facto features or application ownership. Other teams may prefer to adopt an on-call rotation (often referred to as pager duty). In on-call rotations, designated team members handle all first-line incident responses, and they resolve or delegate responsibilities based on predetermined incident thresholds. 4. Determine thresholds Determine incident thresholds for alert conditions For each of your applications: Identify the thresholds for what is officially considered an incident. Make sure each set of threshold criteria is context-dependent. Document incident evaluation and known remediation procedures in runbooks. Include links to your runbooks when you define conditions and thresholds for your alert policies. For instance, a certain alert condition may be dismissable during low-traffic periods but require active remediation during peak hours. 5. Set notification channels Ensure alerts have auditable notification channels Make sure that communications during critical incidents take place in easily accessible and highly visible channels. A group chat room dedicated to incident communication is usually a great choice. This allows all stakeholders to participate or observe and provides a chronology of notifications, key decisions, and actions for postmortem analysis. Use any of the available notification channels in New Relic Alerts. For example, to set up a notification channel in Slack: Make sure your organization has completed New Relic's integration requirements with Slack. In the Slack app, select the dropdown in the top-left corner of the app, and select Customize Slack. Click Configure apps. From the list of app integrations, select New Relic. Expand the instructions for New Relic Alerts, and follow the steps to configure notifications from New Relic. 6. Automate resolution Automate triage and resolution steps Automation of simple or repeatable incident response tasks will increase efficiency and minimize the impact of incidents. With proper automation in place, you can disable or isolate faulty application components as soon as an alert threshold is reached, rather than after a notification has been issued. For example, a team managing an application for a digital media company wants to be able to remove commenting abilities from the website if the system has errors. In this case, they could: Add an endpoint to their front-end web application that will toggle a feature flag enabling or disabling the UI components associated with posting comments on an article. Create an alert policy with a threshold set on the sustained error rate in the commenting service. Assign a webhook notification channel that will send a POST request to this endpoint, as well as to the standard team notification channels. In this scenario, errors in the commenting system will trigger the webhook and remove the commenting UI from the website. Users can still use core functionality of the site without seeing errors generated by the commenting service. The application will maintain a stable but degraded state, allowing the team to focus on recovery without the pressure of preventing users from accessing the site. You can also use webhooks to create issues and action items in ticketing systems that have REST APIs, such as Zendesk. Use New Relic Alerts to create a webhook notification channel, and customize the webhook payload as needed. New Relic also provides integrations for common ticketing systems. You can use any of these integrations to file tickets from APM. 7. Establish reviews Establish a post mortem process After the incident has been resolved, key stakeholders and participants must capture accurate and thorough documentation of the incident. At a minimum, we recommend that the retro documentation includes: A root cause analysis A chronology and summary of remediation steps and their result, whether they were successful or not A measure of the impact to the business in terms of user experience and financial losses, if possible Recommendations for system or feature improvements to prevent a recurrence Recommendations for process and communication improvements Store post mortem reports in a highly visible, searchable repository, such as a shared drive folder or wiki. Culturally, it's essential that this process focuses on constructive learning and improvement rather than punishment or blame. Example post mortem report Here is a brief example of a post mortem report: Post mortem Comments Date March 1, 2018 Executive summary From approximately 1:45PM until 2:30PM, users could not add items to their carts, which prevented any checkouts from occurring during the incident period. Root cause We determined that a change was made to the CSS rules on the product detail page that effectively disabled the Add to cart button. Timeline 1:50PM: Successful checkouts < 10 for 5 minutes alert triggered; assigned to Alice. 1:55PM: After reviewing the ecommerce team dashboard, Alice determined that the threshold was breached immediately following a deploy by Bob. She notified him of the incident. 2:00PM: Alice and Bob began troubleshooting. Attempts at recreating the issue in production were successful. 2:20PM: Bob determined that his change to the CSS on the product detail page disabled the Add to cart button. He deployed a hotfix. 2:30PM: Functionality was restored and the incident was resolved. Impact No checkouts were completed during the duration of the incident. Our typical revenue for a Thursday during this timeframe is $30,000. Recommendations We have been discussing implementing New Relic Synthetics for awhile now. If we had a Synthetic check on the checkout process, this issue would have been detected immediately. We should also implement more thorough unit tests in the front-end web app. 8. Fine-tune process Fine-tune alerts and thresholds As you use New Relic to optimize your application and infrastructure performance, tighten your New Relic Alerts policy conditions to keep pace with your improved performance. When rolling out new code or modifications that could negatively impact performance over a period of time, loosen your threshold conditions to allow for these short-term changes. For instance, we recommend using pre-established baselines and thresholds to increase efficiency during high-impact times for your business, such as annual events and major releases. Fine-tuning gives you the flexibility you need to increase efficiencies and extend your notification channels. As noted earlier, we recommend you start with a group chat service when you first establish notifications. Once you've identified other tools you'd like to integrate with, set up a notification channel to maintain your momentum. Tools such as xMatters and PagerDuty provide popular integrations, but don't overlook simple methods, such as webhooks. The goal is to continuously improve your alerting scheme. Be sure to check your alerts and confirm that they're firing regularly and are still relevant for your customer satisfaction metrics. Use the New Relic platform to create dashboards centered around alerts and incidents for the most common policy conditions and violations. insights.newrelic.com > All dashboards > (selected dashboard) Use the New Relic query language and the Insights query API to create your dashboards. The dashboard above was created using the following NRQL queries. It's recommended you recreate them as needed for your alerting dashboards. Incidents by condition: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state = 'open' FACET condition_name SINCE 1 week ago Copy Incidents by policy: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME where current_state = 'open' FACET policy_name SINCE 60 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Alert trends over time: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state IS NOT NULL FACET policy_name SINCE 1 week ago TIMESERIES Copy Incident details: SELECT timestamp, incident_id, policy_name, condition_name, details, severity FROM ALERT_NAME SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 40 Copy Visualizing this data provides a resource you can share with others to refine the alerts and thresholds you're using. Expert tip In addition to instrumenting and measuring application and infrastructure metrics, mature DevOps organizations often measure and optimize the efficiency of incident response processes. For example, you can use webhooks to send alert events to New Relic Insights. This allows you to supplement your team dashboards with New Relic Alerts data.",

      "body": "Whether you've recently completed your cloud migration, have been using cloud-based services for a while, or have always been in the cloud, you may find yourself deploying modern, cutting-edge technologies and services. It's important to develop the ability to adopt new services easily and with confidence; innovation never stops for companies operating in the cloud, and a company's willingness to embrace new technology can give it a major competitive differentiator. These modern technologies could be container solutions such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Amazon AWS ECS or Fargate, for example. Or they could be serverless services such as AWS Lambda, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform Functions. They may be cloud-based databases, or any number of cloud services that abstract the service away from an operations-maintained infrastructure. In these situations, you want to monitor, query, and alert on the performance and usage metrics for both modern technologies and cloud-based services. This allows your team to deploy faster, to adopt new services with confidence, to make better business decisions, and in general to expand its technology horizons. Here are the steps to using the New Relic Platform to monitor your modern technologies and cloud services: 1. Identify services and technologies Determine the components you need to monitor by answering the following questions: What cloud-based applications do I have? What are the underlying cloud-based services, technologies, and infrastructure supporting those applications? When you have a full understanding of your architecture, you reduce the possibility of missing dependencies and new services that might impact your organization's application environment. 2. Deploy New Relic Infrastructure After reviewing the requirements for New Relic Infrastructure, install the Infrastructure agent on the hosts you identified in Step One so that you can monitor your cloud services. If you use Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for automation, you can use those tools to deploy Infrastructure agents to your hosts. 3. Configure cloud integrations As you integrate new cloud services, you can use New Relic to monitor and report data about these services; giving you a single, comprehensive overview of your entire architecture. To configure cloud service integrations, link your Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service provider account with New Relic. 4. Track data on your dashboards New Relic Infrastructure integrations auto-populate dashboards with metrics from cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP so you can track the data that is critical to your cloud adoption success. Tip If you adopt a hybrid cloud of multiple cloud providers, New Relic can provide a holistic perspective that is agnostic to cloud providers. AWS EC2 monitoring integration dashboard In this default dashboard for the AWS EC2 monitoring integration, New Relic captures metrics for EC2 instances per region, instance state, and instance type. The dashboard also shows inventory for different software packages and configurations that are installed on those instances. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Integrations > Amazon Web Services: View AWS EC2 data on the default dashboard for the AWS EC2 monitoring integration. Azure VMs monitoring integration dashboard The default Azure virtual machine integration dashboard shows data for VM sizes, VMs per region, and VMs per resource group. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Integrations > Microsoft Azure: View Azure virtual machine data on the default dashboard for the Azure VMs monitoring integration. GCP Compute Engine monitoring integration dashboard In this default dashboard for the Google Cloud Platform, New Relic captures metrics for instances per zone, instance status, firewall dropped packets, reserved cores, and disk throttled operations. The dashboard also shows inventory for different software packages and configurations that are installed on those instances. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Integrations > Google Cloud Platform: View GCP Compute Engine data on the default dashboard for the GCP Compute Engine monitoring integration. Example modern and cloud services dashboard In this example dashboard, three different cloud vendors, modern technologies, cloud services, infrastructure instance locations, and DevOps widgets are combined for an overall view. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Here is an example of an Insights dashboard with data about vendors, technologies, services, instances, and other important details for DevOps teams. 5. Add alerts for cloud-based metrics When monitoring cloud-based services, it is essential to keep track of all changes to a system by alerting on them. Integrations with New Relic Infrastructure allow you to create alerts on the metrics that are the most important to you. Here is an example of a baseline alert that will notify you based on the number of requests received on all AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ALB) systems for the ALB monitoring integration: alerts.newrelic.com > Alert policies > (selected policy) > Alert conditions: Create a NRQL baseline alert to monitor the number of requests received your ALB systems. 6. Set up additional monitoring For full-stack visibility into every aspect of your app, we recommend deploying other types of New Relic monitoring: Use APM to report application-tier performance metrics. Use browser monitoring to report front-end web metrics. Use mobile monitoring to report front-end mobile app metrics. Use synthetic monitoring to monitor websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. 7. CI/CD pipeline integration It's important to track deployments and the impact that code and infrastructure changes have on your end-user experience. APM deployment markers allow you to record deployments for each application. A deployment marker is an event indicating that a deployment happened. You can pair markers with metadata from your source code management (SCM) system ( including user IDs, revisions, and change logs.). APM displays a vertical line, or marker, on charts and graphs at the deployment event's timestamp. When you hover over the line, APM displays the associated metadata for that deployment. Tracking deployments is an invaluable way to determine the root causes of immediate, long-term, or gradual degradations in your applications. Recommendation: Make POST requests to the New Relic REST API as the final step of a successful CI/CD deployment, as described in the API documentation. The following tools have integrations or plugins available to help automate CI/CD deployments: Chef (see newrelic_deployment) Jenkins Ansible Puppet 8. AWS Lambda Monitoring New Relic One features an updated APM agent that is highly optimized from a cost and time perspective for ephemeral Lambda functions. Enable New Relic monitoring of AWS Lambda to to assess invocations, error rate, function duration, cold starts, and more. You can also take advantage of New Relic's Infrastructure integration with Lambda for additional reporting capabilities.",

      "body": "Proper instrumentation gives teams full visibility into the impact of the changes they make in a system. Capturing tangible, measurable metrics from before and after each change allows teams to optimize changes in isolation and reduce the impact to other work happening in the system. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, complete the Establish objectives and baselines. 1. Integrate measurements into your development process With appropriate measurements incorporated into all phases of your development cycle, you can surface errors and performance issues before your customers uncover them. As your application teams plan their work, use your KPI dashboards in daily stand-ups and other planning meetings to analyze necessary debugging work, assess whether recent deployments were successful, and prioritize other work efforts. When development and operations teams use dashboards during planning and discussions, they ensure that they're consistently incorporating feedback about customer experiences and reliability risks into their development efforts. For proper testing, ensure that instrumentation in your pre-production environments is in parity with your production environments. Use dashboards to compare the environments and verify that the code and infrastructure changes you make across them are correct, and eliminate any anomalies before pushing code to production. Beyond using instrumentation to measure software performance, also use it to analyze team efficiency. For example, with your alerts data, use NRQL and external integrations to calculate mean time to repair (MTTR) by subtracting the difference in event timestamps as the current state of each event changes from OPEN to ACKNOWLEDGED to CLOSED. Or push events into Insights from a source code management (SCM) system like GitHub, and calculate the amount of time it takes a code change to go live by comparing the timestamp of a commit event to that of a deploy event. Plotted over time, this could become a KPI in a DevOps transformation. 2. Add automated deployment markers It's important to track deployments and the impact code and infrastructure changes have on your end-user experience. Using deployment markers in APM, you can record deployments for each application. A deployment marker is an event indicating that a deployment happened, and it's paired with metadata available from your SCM system (for example, the user, revision, or change-log). APM displays a vertical line, or “marker,” on charts and graphs at the deployment event's timestamp. When you hover over the line, APM displays the associated metadata for that deployment. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview APM also provides a chronological list of deployments of your application. Additional metrics, such as error rate and Apdex from the time of the deployment, are available as well. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Deployments Tracking deployments is a valuable way to determine the root cause of immediate, long-term, or gradual degradations in your application. New Relic recommends that you make POST requests to the New Relic REST API as the final step of a successful CI/CD deployment as described in the API documentation. The following tools have integrations or plugins available to help automate this: Chef (see newrelic_deployment) Jenkins Ansible Puppet 3. Test your pipeline with Infrastructure An important part of optimizing your cloud native environment is a making a cultural shift toward smaller, more frequent changes to your code and infrastructure. After you complete the first two steps of this tutorial, begin to test and gather appropriate performance insights about your deployment pipeline to more clearly understand the impact of the changes you make. Code changes should be as small as possible in terms of the number of lines of code and source files you change. Changes should also involve as few team members as possible. This makes it much easier to identify issue owners and determine root causes if errors occur. Similarly, infrastructure changes should also have as small a footprint as possible to minimize the number of applications affected by each change. New Relic Infrastructure helps you see when an infrastructure change has caused a spike in issues, as shown in the following example: one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts For cloud infrastructure changes or larger code changes, consider using a blue/green deployment strategy. APM supports multiple app names, which is a good fit for this model. To implement this strategy: Deploy a version of your application to existing infrastructure using a rollup app name that signifies it as the “blue” version (or control version). Deploy a new version of your application to a subset of the infrastructure (or an alternate set of infrastructure) with a rollup name that signifies this as the “green” version (or experimental version). Ensure that traffic is routed appropriately between both versions. Compare established KPI dashboards of both versions against one another. Optimize the new version accordingly to meet your KPI targets. When you're satisfied with the application's performance, deploy the new version across your infrastructure using the original app name, and consider this the new baseline for any future changes you'll make to the application.",

      "body": "The term alerting often carries some negative connotations: many developers correlate alerting with errors, mistakes, and ongoing issues. However, developers who are proactive about alerting, know they don't have to stare at dashboards all day because effective alerts tell them when to check in. Well-defined alerts help you understand the health of your systems, so you can respond to performance problems before they affect your customers. Further, a focused alerts policy helps you pinpoint any degradation that could impact performance in your application or environment. With proactive alerting, you'll decrease user-reported incidents, and your teams will spend less time firefighting and more time deploying significant changes to your product. After you define the right alerts, proper incident orchestration aligns your teams, tools, and processes to prepare for incidents and outages in your software. The goal is to provide your teams a predictable framework and process to: Maximize efficiency in communication and effort. Minimize the overall impact to your business.

Define policies Define required alerting policies based on SLOs. A service level objective (SLO) is an agreed upon means of measuring the performance of your service. The SLO defines a target value of a specified quantitative measure, which is called a service level indicator (SLI). Examples of service level indicators could be average response time, response time percentile, and application availability. SLOs would then clarify a target value for those SLIs such as: Average response time should be less than 200 ms. 95% of requests should be completed within 250 ms. Availability of the service should be 99.99%. These SLOs can also be logically grouped together to provide an overall boolean indicator of whether the service is meeting expectations or not (for example, 95% of requests completed within 250 ms AND availability is 99.99%), which can be helpful for alerting purposes. Use these SLIs as key performance indicators (KPIs) so your team and organization can measure your service and ensure it's meeting customer expectations. By breaking down the quantitative performance metrics that are required of your services, you can then identify what kinds of alerts you should set for each. For instance, you could set an alert to notify you if web transaction times go above half a millisecond, or if the error rate goes higher than 0.20%. However, not every SLO needs to become an alert. A strong alerting strategy takes SLOs and creates a set of simple, actionable alerts. New Relic often finds that our most mature customers set fewer alerts in general and focus those alerts on a core set of metrics that indicate when their customer experience is truly degraded. As a result, New Relic customers often use Apdex as part of their alerting strategy to align alerts with signs of degraded user satisfaction. As you design your alerting strategy, keep this question in mind: “If the customer isn’t impacted, is it worth waking someone up?” Example questions and KPI solutions For a simple framework of areas to set alerts for, use the following questions and advised metrics and KPIs: Questions Metrics and KPIs Are we open for business? Use browser monitoring and APM to alert on site availability. How's our underlying infrastructure? Set KPIs for key hardware, network, and storage components. How's the health of our application? Track metrics for JVM performance, queuing, caching, and similar dependencies. How’s the overall quality of our application? Use an Apdex score to quickly access an application’s quality. How are our customers doing? Consider real end-user metrics (browser or APM), synthetic users (Synthetics), and Apdex scores. How's our overall business doing? Focus on key transactions within an application, and tie them to expected business outcomes to illustrate correlation between your application and business performance. 2. Set specific alerts Set specific alerts for performance, correctness, throughput, availability, and dependencies With New Relic you can set alerts on your instrumented applications, end-user experience, infrastructure, databases, and more. New Relic will alert you if your site's availability dips or if your error rate spikes above acceptable levels, as defined by your SLOs. You can set warning thresholds to monitor issues that may be approaching a critical severity but don't yet warrant a pager notification. Setting thresholds for when alerts should notify teams can be challenging. Thresholds that are too tight will create alert fatigue while thresholds that are too loose will lead to unhappy customers. Baseline alerts allow you to set dynamic thresholds for alerts based on historical performance. Use baselines to tune your alert to the right threshold. For example, an alert in APM can notify incident response teams if web transaction times deviate from historical performance for an allotted amount of time. alerts.newrelic.com > (selected alert policy) > (selected alert condition) > Define thresholds You can set this same kind of alert in browser to catch sub-optimal performance. In the following example, we've set both a warning and a violation for throughput: alerts.newrelic.com > (selected alert policy) > (selected alert condition) > Define thresholds As you develop smaller, independent services running on increasingly ephemeral architectures, your environments become significantly more complex. Visibility into outliers can be an important tool for understanding likely performance issues. You should set alerts to automatically fire when you have an outlier, which can indicate misbehaving hosts, load balancers, or apps. For example, a load balancer divides web traffic across five different servers. You can set an alert based on a NRQL query and receive a notification if any server starts getting significantly more or less traffic than the other servers. Here is an example chart: And here's a sample NRQL query: SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample WHERE apmApplicationNames = 'MY-APP-NAME' FACET hostname Copy Now you have set static, baseline, and outlier alerts. This can provide a comprehensive awareness of your ecosystem. Refer to the New Relic Alerts documentation for more details about optimizing your alerts. 3. Identify groups Identify groups to alert, set broadcasting methods, and assign first responders to team dashboards Alerting without the proper broadcasting methods leaves you vulnerable. Your alerting strategy should include a notification channel to ensure the appropriate teams are notified if your application or architecture encounters issues. New Relic has many notification integrations, but we recommend that you start simple and add more complexity later. We recommend that you first send alerts to a group chat channel (for example, using Slack or PagerDuty). Evaluate these alerts in real time for several weeks to understand which alerts are indicative of important or problematic issues. These are the types of alerts that warrant waking someone up. Recommendation: For each team dashboard, make sure: It has an owner who assumes responsibility for the health of the applications and features it monitors. There is no ambiguity about who is responsible for attending to and resolving an alert condition. This policy will vary between organizations depending on size, structure, and culture. For example, some teams may prefer to assign dashboards and alerts based on de-facto features or application ownership. Other teams may prefer to adopt an on-call rotation (often referred to as pager duty). In on-call rotations, designated team members handle all first-line incident responses, and they resolve or delegate responsibilities based on predetermined incident thresholds. 4. Determine thresholds Determine incident thresholds for alert conditions For each of your applications: Identify the thresholds for what is officially considered an incident. Make sure each set of threshold criteria is context-dependent. Document incident evaluation and known remediation procedures in runbooks. Include links to your runbooks when you define conditions and thresholds for your alert policies. For instance, a certain alert condition may be dismissable during low-traffic periods but require active remediation during peak hours. 5. Set notification channels Ensure alerts have auditable notification channels Make sure that communications during critical incidents take place in easily accessible and highly visible channels. A group chat room dedicated to incident communication is usually a great choice. This allows all stakeholders to participate or observe and provides a chronology of notifications, key decisions, and actions for postmortem analysis. Use any of the available notification channels in New Relic Alerts. For example, to set up a notification channel in Slack: Make sure your organization has completed New Relic's integration requirements with Slack. In the Slack app, select the dropdown in the top-left corner of the app, and select Customize Slack. Click Configure apps. From the list of app integrations, select New Relic. Expand the instructions for New Relic Alerts, and follow the steps to configure notifications from New Relic. 6. Automate resolution Automate triage and resolution steps Automation of simple or repeatable incident response tasks will increase efficiency and minimize the impact of incidents. With proper automation in place, you can disable or isolate faulty application components as soon as an alert threshold is reached, rather than after a notification has been issued. For example, a team managing an application for a digital media company wants to be able to remove commenting abilities from the website if the system has errors. In this case, they could: Add an endpoint to their front-end web application that will toggle a feature flag enabling or disabling the UI components associated with posting comments on an article. Create an alert policy with a threshold set on the sustained error rate in the commenting service. Assign a webhook notification channel that will send a POST request to this endpoint, as well as to the standard team notification channels. In this scenario, errors in the commenting system will trigger the webhook and remove the commenting UI from the website. Users can still use core functionality of the site without seeing errors generated by the commenting service. The application will maintain a stable but degraded state, allowing the team to focus on recovery without the pressure of preventing users from accessing the site. You can also use webhooks to create issues and action items in ticketing systems that have REST APIs, such as Zendesk. Use New Relic Alerts to create a webhook notification channel, and customize the webhook payload as needed. New Relic also provides integrations for common ticketing systems. You can use any of these integrations to file tickets from APM. 7. Establish reviews Establish a post mortem process After the incident has been resolved, key stakeholders and participants must capture accurate and thorough documentation of the incident. At a minimum, we recommend that the retro documentation includes: A root cause analysis A chronology and summary of remediation steps and their result, whether they were successful or not A measure of the impact to the business in terms of user experience and financial losses, if possible Recommendations for system or feature improvements to prevent a recurrence Recommendations for process and communication improvements Store post mortem reports in a highly visible, searchable repository, such as a shared drive folder or wiki. Culturally, it's essential that this process focuses on constructive learning and improvement rather than punishment or blame. Example post mortem report Here is a brief example of a post mortem report: Post mortem Comments Date March 1, 2018 Executive summary From approximately 1:45PM until 2:30PM, users could not add items to their carts, which prevented any checkouts from occurring during the incident period. Root cause We determined that a change was made to the CSS rules on the product detail page that effectively disabled the Add to cart button. Timeline 1:50PM: Successful checkouts < 10 for 5 minutes alert triggered; assigned to Alice. 1:55PM: After reviewing the ecommerce team dashboard, Alice determined that the threshold was breached immediately following a deploy by Bob. She notified him of the incident. 2:00PM: Alice and Bob began troubleshooting. Attempts at recreating the issue in production were successful. 2:20PM: Bob determined that his change to the CSS on the product detail page disabled the Add to cart button. He deployed a hotfix. 2:30PM: Functionality was restored and the incident was resolved. Impact No checkouts were completed during the duration of the incident. Our typical revenue for a Thursday during this timeframe is $30,000. Recommendations We have been discussing implementing New Relic Synthetics for awhile now. If we had a Synthetic check on the checkout process, this issue would have been detected immediately. We should also implement more thorough unit tests in the front-end web app. 8. Fine-tune process Fine-tune alerts and thresholds As you use New Relic to optimize your application and infrastructure performance, tighten your New Relic Alerts policy conditions to keep pace with your improved performance. When rolling out new code or modifications that could negatively impact performance over a period of time, loosen your threshold conditions to allow for these short-term changes. For instance, we recommend using pre-established baselines and thresholds to increase efficiency during high-impact times for your business, such as annual events and major releases. Fine-tuning gives you the flexibility you need to increase efficiencies and extend your notification channels. As noted earlier, we recommend you start with a group chat service when you first establish notifications. Once you've identified other tools you'd like to integrate with, set up a notification channel to maintain your momentum. Tools such as xMatters and PagerDuty provide popular integrations, but don't overlook simple methods, such as webhooks. The goal is to continuously improve your alerting scheme. Be sure to check your alerts and confirm that they're firing regularly and are still relevant for your customer satisfaction metrics. Use the New Relic platform to create dashboards centered around alerts and incidents for the most common policy conditions and violations. insights.newrelic.com > All dashboards > (selected dashboard) Use the New Relic query language and the Insights query API to create your dashboards. The dashboard above was created using the following NRQL queries. It's recommended you recreate them as needed for your alerting dashboards. Incidents by condition: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state = 'open' FACET condition_name SINCE 1 week ago Copy Incidents by policy: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME where current_state = 'open' FACET policy_name SINCE 60 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Alert trends over time: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state IS NOT NULL FACET policy_name SINCE 1 week ago TIMESERIES Copy Incident details: SELECT timestamp, incident_id, policy_name, condition_name, details, severity FROM ALERT_NAME SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 40 Copy Visualizing this data provides a resource you can share with others to refine the alerts and thresholds you're using. Expert tip In addition to instrumenting and measuring application and infrastructure metrics, mature DevOps organizations often measure and optimize the efficiency of incident response processes. For example, you can use webhooks to send alert events to New Relic Insights. This allows you to supplement your team dashboards with New Relic Alerts data.",

      "body": "Whether you've recently completed your cloud migration, have been using cloud-based services for a while, or have always been in the cloud, you may find yourself deploying modern, cutting-edge technologies and services. It's important to develop the ability to adopt new services easily and with confidence; innovation never stops for companies operating in the cloud, and a company's willingness to embrace new technology can give it a major competitive differentiator. These modern technologies could be container solutions such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Amazon AWS ECS or Fargate, for example. Or they could be serverless services such as AWS Lambda, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform Functions. They may be cloud-based databases, or any number of cloud services that abstract the service away from an operations-maintained infrastructure. In these situations, you want to monitor, query, and alert on the performance and usage metrics for both modern technologies and cloud-based services. This allows your team to deploy faster, to adopt new services with confidence, to make better business decisions, and in general to expand its technology horizons. Here are the steps to using the New Relic Platform to monitor your modern technologies and cloud services: 1. Identify services and technologies Determine the components you need to monitor by answering the following questions: What cloud-based applications do I have? What are the underlying cloud-based services, technologies, and infrastructure supporting those applications? When you have a full understanding of your architecture, you reduce the possibility of missing dependencies and new services that might impact your organization's application environment. 2. Deploy New Relic Infrastructure After reviewing the requirements for New Relic Infrastructure, install the Infrastructure agent on the hosts you identified in Step One so that you can monitor your cloud services. If you use Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for automation, you can use those tools to deploy Infrastructure agents to your hosts. 3. Configure cloud integrations As you integrate new cloud services, you can use New Relic to monitor and report data about these services; giving you a single, comprehensive overview of your entire architecture. To configure cloud service integrations, link your Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service provider account with New Relic. 4. Track data on your dashboards New Relic Infrastructure integrations auto-populate dashboards with metrics from cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP so you can track the data that is critical to your cloud adoption success. Tip If you adopt a hybrid cloud of multiple cloud providers, New Relic can provide a holistic perspective that is agnostic to cloud providers. AWS EC2 monitoring integration dashboard In this default dashboard for the AWS EC2 monitoring integration, New Relic captures metrics for EC2 instances per region, instance state, and instance type. The dashboard also shows inventory for different software packages and configurations that are installed on those instances. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Integrations > Amazon Web Services: View AWS EC2 data on the default dashboard for the AWS EC2 monitoring integration. Azure VMs monitoring integration dashboard The default Azure virtual machine integration dashboard shows data for VM sizes, VMs per region, and VMs per resource group. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Integrations > Microsoft Azure: View Azure virtual machine data on the default dashboard for the Azure VMs monitoring integration. GCP Compute Engine monitoring integration dashboard In this default dashboard for the Google Cloud Platform, New Relic captures metrics for instances per zone, instance status, firewall dropped packets, reserved cores, and disk throttled operations. The dashboard also shows inventory for different software packages and configurations that are installed on those instances. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Integrations > Google Cloud Platform: View GCP Compute Engine data on the default dashboard for the GCP Compute Engine monitoring integration. Example modern and cloud services dashboard In this example dashboard, three different cloud vendors, modern technologies, cloud services, infrastructure instance locations, and DevOps widgets are combined for an overall view. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Here is an example of an Insights dashboard with data about vendors, technologies, services, instances, and other important details for DevOps teams. 5. Add alerts for cloud-based metrics When monitoring cloud-based services, it is essential to keep track of all changes to a system by alerting on them. Integrations with New Relic Infrastructure allow you to create alerts on the metrics that are the most important to you. Here is an example of a baseline alert that will notify you based on the number of requests received on all AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ALB) systems for the ALB monitoring integration: alerts.newrelic.com > Alert policies > (selected policy) > Alert conditions: Create a NRQL baseline alert to monitor the number of requests received your ALB systems. 6. Set up additional monitoring For full-stack visibility into every aspect of your app, we recommend deploying other types of New Relic monitoring: Use APM to report application-tier performance metrics. Use browser monitoring to report front-end web metrics. Use mobile monitoring to report front-end mobile app metrics. Use synthetic monitoring to monitor websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. 7. CI/CD pipeline integration It's important to track deployments and the impact that code and infrastructure changes have on your end-user experience. APM deployment markers allow you to record deployments for each application. A deployment marker is an event indicating that a deployment happened. You can pair markers with metadata from your source code management (SCM) system ( including user IDs, revisions, and change logs.). APM displays a vertical line, or marker, on charts and graphs at the deployment event's timestamp. When you hover over the line, APM displays the associated metadata for that deployment. Tracking deployments is an invaluable way to determine the root causes of immediate, long-term, or gradual degradations in your applications. Recommendation: Make POST requests to the New Relic REST API as the final step of a successful CI/CD deployment, as described in the API documentation. The following tools have integrations or plugins available to help automate CI/CD deployments: Chef (see newrelic_deployment) Jenkins Ansible Puppet 8. AWS Lambda Monitoring New Relic One features an updated APM agent that is highly optimized from a cost and time perspective for ephemeral Lambda functions. Enable New Relic monitoring of AWS Lambda to to assess invocations, error rate, function duration, cold starts, and more. You can also take advantage of New Relic's Infrastructure integration with Lambda for additional reporting capabilities.",

      "body": "Proper instrumentation gives teams full visibility into the impact of the changes they make in a system. Capturing tangible, measurable metrics from before and after each change allows teams to optimize changes in isolation and reduce the impact to other work happening in the system. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, complete the Establish objectives and baselines. 1. Integrate measurements into your development process With appropriate measurements incorporated into all phases of your development cycle, you can surface errors and performance issues before your customers uncover them. As your application teams plan their work, use your KPI dashboards in daily stand-ups and other planning meetings to analyze necessary debugging work, assess whether recent deployments were successful, and prioritize other work efforts. When development and operations teams use dashboards during planning and discussions, they ensure that they're consistently incorporating feedback about customer experiences and reliability risks into their development efforts. For proper testing, ensure that instrumentation in your pre-production environments is in parity with your production environments. Use dashboards to compare the environments and verify that the code and infrastructure changes you make across them are correct, and eliminate any anomalies before pushing code to production. Beyond using instrumentation to measure software performance, also use it to analyze team efficiency. For example, with your alerts data, use NRQL and external integrations to calculate mean time to repair (MTTR) by subtracting the difference in event timestamps as the current state of each event changes from OPEN to ACKNOWLEDGED to CLOSED. Or push events into Insights from a source code management (SCM) system like GitHub, and calculate the amount of time it takes a code change to go live by comparing the timestamp of a commit event to that of a deploy event. Plotted over time, this could become a KPI in a DevOps transformation. 2. Add automated deployment markers It's important to track deployments and the impact code and infrastructure changes have on your end-user experience. Using deployment markers in APM, you can record deployments for each application. A deployment marker is an event indicating that a deployment happened, and it's paired with metadata available from your SCM system (for example, the user, revision, or change-log). APM displays a vertical line, or “marker,” on charts and graphs at the deployment event's timestamp. When you hover over the line, APM displays the associated metadata for that deployment. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview APM also provides a chronological list of deployments of your application. Additional metrics, such as error rate and Apdex from the time of the deployment, are available as well. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Deployments Tracking deployments is a valuable way to determine the root cause of immediate, long-term, or gradual degradations in your application. New Relic recommends that you make POST requests to the New Relic REST API as the final step of a successful CI/CD deployment as described in the API documentation. The following tools have integrations or plugins available to help automate this: Chef (see newrelic_deployment) Jenkins Ansible Puppet 3. Test your pipeline with Infrastructure An important part of optimizing your cloud native environment is a making a cultural shift toward smaller, more frequent changes to your code and infrastructure. After you complete the first two steps of this tutorial, begin to test and gather appropriate performance insights about your deployment pipeline to more clearly understand the impact of the changes you make. Code changes should be as small as possible in terms of the number of lines of code and source files you change. Changes should also involve as few team members as possible. This makes it much easier to identify issue owners and determine root causes if errors occur. Similarly, infrastructure changes should also have as small a footprint as possible to minimize the number of applications affected by each change. New Relic Infrastructure helps you see when an infrastructure change has caused a spike in issues, as shown in the following example: one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts For cloud infrastructure changes or larger code changes, consider using a blue/green deployment strategy. APM supports multiple app names, which is a good fit for this model. To implement this strategy: Deploy a version of your application to existing infrastructure using a rollup app name that signifies it as the “blue” version (or control version). Deploy a new version of your application to a subset of the infrastructure (or an alternate set of infrastructure) with a rollup name that signifies this as the “green” version (or experimental version). Ensure that traffic is routed appropriately between both versions. Compare established KPI dashboards of both versions against one another. Optimize the new version accordingly to meet your KPI targets. When you're satisfied with the application's performance, deploy the new version across your infrastructure using the original app name, and consider this the new baseline for any future changes you'll make to the application.",

      "body": "The term alerting often carries some negative connotations: many developers correlate alerting with errors, mistakes, and ongoing issues. However, developers who are proactive about alerting, know they don't have to stare at dashboards all day because effective alerts tell them when to check in. Well-defined alerts help you understand the health of your systems, so you can respond to performance problems before they affect your customers. Further, a focused alerts policy helps you pinpoint any degradation that could impact performance in your application or environment. With proactive alerting, you'll decrease user-reported incidents, and your teams will spend less time firefighting and more time deploying significant changes to your product. After you define the right alerts, proper incident orchestration aligns your teams, tools, and processes to prepare for incidents and outages in your software. The goal is to provide your teams a predictable framework and process to: Maximize efficiency in communication and effort. Minimize the overall impact to your business. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you have: Instrumented your applications in New Relic. Reviewed the Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. Optionally added custom attributes and events. 1. Define policies Define required alerting policies based on SLOs. A service level objective (SLO) is an agreed upon means of measuring the performance of your service. The SLO defines a target value of a specified quantitative measure, which is called a service level indicator (SLI). Examples of service level indicators could be average response time, response time percentile, and application availability. SLOs would then clarify a target value for those SLIs such as: Average response time should be less than 200 ms. 95% of requests should be completed within 250 ms. Availability of the service should be 99.99%. These SLOs can also be logically grouped together to provide an overall boolean indicator of whether the service is meeting expectations or not (for example, 95% of requests completed within 250 ms AND availability is 99.99%), which can be helpful for alerting purposes. Use these SLIs as key performance indicators (KPIs) so your team and organization can measure your service and ensure it's meeting customer expectations. By breaking down the quantitative performance metrics that are required of your services, you can then identify what kinds of alerts you should set for each. For instance, you could set an alert to notify you if web transaction times go above half a millisecond, or if the error rate goes higher than 0.20%. However, not every SLO needs to become an alert. A strong alerting strategy takes SLOs and creates a set of simple, actionable alerts. New Relic often finds that our most mature customers set fewer alerts in general and focus those alerts on a core set of metrics that indicate when their customer experience is truly degraded. As a result, New Relic customers often use Apdex as part of their alerting strategy to align alerts with signs of degraded user satisfaction. As you design your alerting strategy, keep this question in mind: “If the customer isn’t impacted, is it worth waking someone up?” Example questions and KPI solutions For a simple framework of areas to set alerts for, use the following questions and advised metrics and KPIs: Questions Metrics and KPIs Are we open for business? Use browser monitoring and APM to alert on site availability. How's our underlying infrastructure? Set KPIs for key hardware, network, and storage components. How's the health of our application? Track metrics for JVM performance, queuing, caching, and similar dependencies. How’s the overall quality of our application? Use an Apdex score to quickly access an application’s quality. How are our customers doing? Consider real end-user metrics (browser or APM), synthetic users (Synthetics), and Apdex scores. How's our overall business doing? Focus on key transactions within an application, and tie them to expected business outcomes to illustrate correlation between your application and business performance. 2. Set specific alerts Set specific alerts for performance, correctness, throughput, availability, and dependencies With New Relic you can set alerts on your instrumented applications, end-user experience, infrastructure, databases, and more. New Relic will alert you if your site's availability dips or if your error rate spikes above acceptable levels, as defined by your SLOs. You can set warning thresholds to monitor issues that may be approaching a critical severity but don't yet warrant a pager notification. Setting thresholds for when alerts should notify teams can be challenging. Thresholds that are too tight will create alert fatigue while thresholds that are too loose will lead to unhappy customers. Baseline alerts allow you to set dynamic thresholds for alerts based on historical performance. Use baselines to tune your alert to the right threshold. For example, an alert in APM can notify incident response teams if web transaction times deviate from historical performance for an allotted amount of time. alerts.newrelic.com > (selected alert policy) > (selected alert condition) > Define thresholds You can set this same kind of alert in browser to catch sub-optimal performance. In the following example, we've set both a warning and a violation for throughput: alerts.newrelic.com > (selected alert policy) > (selected alert condition) > Define thresholds As you develop smaller, independent services running on increasingly ephemeral architectures, your environments become significantly more complex. Visibility into outliers can be an important tool for understanding likely performance issues. You should set alerts to automatically fire when you have an outlier, which can indicate misbehaving hosts, load balancers, or apps. For example, a load balancer divides web traffic across five different servers. You can set an alert based on a NRQL query and receive a notification if any server starts getting significantly more or less traffic than the other servers. Here is an example chart: And here's a sample NRQL query: SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample WHERE apmApplicationNames = 'MY-APP-NAME' FACET hostname Copy Now you have set static, baseline, and outlier alerts. This can provide a comprehensive awareness of your ecosystem. Refer to the New Relic Alerts documentation for more details about optimizing your alerts. 3. Identify groups Identify groups to alert, set broadcasting methods, and assign first responders to team dashboards Alerting without the proper broadcasting methods leaves you vulnerable. Your alerting strategy should include a notification channel to ensure the appropriate teams are notified if your application or architecture encounters issues. New Relic has many notification integrations, but we recommend that you start simple and add more complexity later. We recommend that you first send alerts to a group chat channel (for example, using Slack or PagerDuty). Evaluate these alerts in real time for several weeks to understand which alerts are indicative of important or problematic issues. These are the types of alerts that warrant waking someone up. Recommendation: For each team dashboard, make sure: It has an owner who assumes responsibility for the health of the applications and features it monitors. There is no ambiguity about who is responsible for attending to and resolving an alert condition. This policy will vary between organizations depending on size, structure, and culture. For example, some teams may prefer to assign dashboards and alerts based on de-facto features or application ownership. Other teams may prefer to adopt an on-call rotation (often referred to as pager duty). In on-call rotations, designated team members handle all first-line incident responses, and they resolve or delegate responsibilities based on predetermined incident thresholds. 4. Determine thresholds Determine incident thresholds for alert conditions For each of your applications: Identify the thresholds for what is officially considered an incident. Make sure each set of threshold criteria is context-dependent. Document incident evaluation and known remediation procedures in runbooks. Include links to your runbooks when you define conditions and thresholds for your alert policies. For instance, a certain alert condition may be dismissable during low-traffic periods but require active remediation during peak hours. 5. Set notification channels Ensure alerts have auditable notification channels Make sure that communications during critical incidents take place in easily accessible and highly visible channels. A group chat room dedicated to incident communication is usually a great choice. This allows all stakeholders to participate or observe and provides a chronology of notifications, key decisions, and actions for postmortem analysis. Use any of the available notification channels in New Relic Alerts. For example, to set up a notification channel in Slack: Make sure your organization has completed New Relic's integration requirements with Slack. In the Slack app, select the dropdown in the top-left corner of the app, and select Customize Slack. Click Configure apps. From the list of app integrations, select New Relic. Expand the instructions for New Relic Alerts, and follow the steps to configure notifications from New Relic. 6. Automate resolution Automate triage and resolution steps Automation of simple or repeatable incident response tasks will increase efficiency and minimize the impact of incidents. With proper automation in place, you can disable or isolate faulty application components as soon as an alert threshold is reached, rather than after a notification has been issued. For example, a team managing an application for a digital media company wants to be able to remove commenting abilities from the website if the system has errors. In this case, they could: Add an endpoint to their front-end web application that will toggle a feature flag enabling or disabling the UI components associated with posting comments on an article. Create an alert policy with a threshold set on the sustained error rate in the commenting service. Assign a webhook notification channel that will send a POST request to this endpoint, as well as to the standard team notification channels. In this scenario, errors in the commenting system will trigger the webhook and remove the commenting UI from the website. Users can still use core functionality of the site without seeing errors generated by the commenting service. The application will maintain a stable but degraded state, allowing the team to focus on recovery without the pressure of preventing users from accessing the site. You can also use webhooks to create issues and action items in ticketing systems that have REST APIs, such as Zendesk. Use New Relic Alerts to create a webhook notification channel, and customize the webhook payload as needed. New Relic also provides integrations for common ticketing systems. You can use any of these integrations to file tickets from APM. 7. Establish reviews Establish a post mortem process After the incident has been resolved, key stakeholders and participants must capture accurate and thorough documentation of the incident. At a minimum, we recommend that the retro documentation includes: A root cause analysis A chronology and summary of remediation steps and their result, whether they were successful or not A measure of the impact to the business in terms of user experience and financial losses, if possible Recommendations for system or feature improvements to prevent a recurrence Recommendations for process and communication improvements Store post mortem reports in a highly visible, searchable repository, such as a shared drive folder or wiki. Culturally, it's essential that this process focuses on constructive learning and improvement rather than punishment or blame. Example post mortem report Here is a brief example of a post mortem report: Post mortem Comments Date March 1, 2018 Executive summary From approximately 1:45PM until 2:30PM, users could not add items to their carts, which prevented any checkouts from occurring during the incident period. Root cause We determined that a change was made to the CSS rules on the product detail page that effectively disabled the Add to cart button. Timeline 1:50PM: Successful checkouts < 10 for 5 minutes alert triggered; assigned to Alice. 1:55PM: After reviewing the ecommerce team dashboard, Alice determined that the threshold was breached immediately following a deploy by Bob. She notified him of the incident. 2:00PM: Alice and Bob began troubleshooting. Attempts at recreating the issue in production were successful. 2:20PM: Bob determined that his change to the CSS on the product detail page disabled the Add to cart button. He deployed a hotfix. 2:30PM: Functionality was restored and the incident was resolved. Impact No checkouts were completed during the duration of the incident. Our typical revenue for a Thursday during this timeframe is $30,000. Recommendations We have been discussing implementing New Relic Synthetics for awhile now. If we had a Synthetic check on the checkout process, this issue would have been detected immediately. We should also implement more thorough unit tests in the front-end web app. 8. Fine-tune process Fine-tune alerts and thresholds As you use New Relic to optimize your application and infrastructure performance, tighten your New Relic Alerts policy conditions to keep pace with your improved performance. When rolling out new code or modifications that could negatively impact performance over a period of time, loosen your threshold conditions to allow for these short-term changes. For instance, we recommend using pre-established baselines and thresholds to increase efficiency during high-impact times for your business, such as annual events and major releases. Fine-tuning gives you the flexibility you need to increase efficiencies and extend your notification channels. As noted earlier, we recommend you start with a group chat service when you first establish notifications. Once you've identified other tools you'd like to integrate with, set up a notification channel to maintain your momentum. Tools such as xMatters and PagerDuty provide popular integrations, but don't overlook simple methods, such as webhooks. The goal is to continuously improve your alerting scheme. Be sure to check your alerts and confirm that they're firing regularly and are still relevant for your customer satisfaction metrics. Use the New Relic platform to create dashboards centered around alerts and incidents for the most common policy conditions and violations. insights.newrelic.com > All dashboards > (selected dashboard) Use the New Relic query language and the Insights query API to create your dashboards. The dashboard above was created using the following NRQL queries. It's recommended you recreate them as needed for your alerting dashboards. Incidents by condition: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state = 'open' FACET condition_name SINCE 1 week ago Copy Incidents by policy: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME where current_state = 'open' FACET policy_name SINCE 60 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Alert trends over time: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state IS NOT NULL FACET policy_name SINCE 1 week ago TIMESERIES Copy Incident details: SELECT timestamp, incident_id, policy_name, condition_name, details, severity FROM ALERT_NAME SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 40 Copy Visualizing this data provides a resource you can share with others to refine the alerts and thresholds you're using. Expert tip In addition to instrumenting and measuring application and infrastructure metrics, mature DevOps organizations often measure and optimize the efficiency of incident response processes. For example, you can use webhooks to send alert events to New Relic Insights. This allows you to supplement your team dashboards with New Relic Alerts data.",

      "body": "Whether you've recently completed your cloud migration, have been using cloud-based services for a while, or have always been in the cloud, you may find yourself deploying modern, cutting-edge technologies and services. It's important to develop the ability to adopt new services easily and with confidence; innovation never stops for companies operating in the cloud, and a company's willingness to embrace new technology can give it a major competitive differentiator. These modern technologies could be container solutions such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Amazon AWS ECS or Fargate, for example. Or they could be serverless services such as AWS Lambda, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform Functions. They may be cloud-based databases, or any number of cloud services that abstract the service away from an operations-maintained infrastructure. In these situations, you want to monitor, query, and alert on the performance and usage metrics for both modern technologies and cloud-based services. This allows your team to deploy faster, to adopt new services with confidence, to make better business decisions, and in general to expand its technology horizons. Here are the steps to using the New Relic Platform to monitor your modern technologies and cloud services: 1. Identify services and technologies Determine the components you need to monitor by answering the following questions: What cloud-based applications do I have? What are the underlying cloud-based services, technologies, and infrastructure supporting those applications? When you have a full understanding of your architecture, you reduce the possibility of missing dependencies and new services that might impact your organization's application environment. 2. Deploy New Relic Infrastructure After reviewing the requirements for New Relic Infrastructure, install the Infrastructure agent on the hosts you identified in Step One so that you can monitor your cloud services. If you use Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for automation, you can use those tools to deploy Infrastructure agents to your hosts. 3. Configure cloud integrations As you integrate new cloud services, you can use New Relic to monitor and report data about these services; giving you a single, comprehensive overview of your entire architecture. To configure cloud service integrations, link your Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service provider account with New Relic. 4. Track data on your dashboards New Relic Infrastructure integrations auto-populate dashboards with metrics from cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP so you can track the data that is critical to your cloud adoption success. Tip If you adopt a hybrid cloud of multiple cloud providers, New Relic can provide a holistic perspective that is agnostic to cloud providers. AWS EC2 monitoring integration dashboard In this default dashboard for the AWS EC2 monitoring integration, New Relic captures metrics for EC2 instances per region, instance state, and instance type. The dashboard also shows inventory for different software packages and configurations that are installed on those instances. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Integrations > Amazon Web Services: View AWS EC2 data on the default dashboard for the AWS EC2 monitoring integration. Azure VMs monitoring integration dashboard The default Azure virtual machine integration dashboard shows data for VM sizes, VMs per region, and VMs per resource group. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Integrations > Microsoft Azure: View Azure virtual machine data on the default dashboard for the Azure VMs monitoring integration. GCP Compute Engine monitoring integration dashboard In this default dashboard for the Google Cloud Platform, New Relic captures metrics for instances per zone, instance status, firewall dropped packets, reserved cores, and disk throttled operations. The dashboard also shows inventory for different software packages and configurations that are installed on those instances. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Integrations > Google Cloud Platform: View GCP Compute Engine data on the default dashboard for the GCP Compute Engine monitoring integration. Example modern and cloud services dashboard In this example dashboard, three different cloud vendors, modern technologies, cloud services, infrastructure instance locations, and DevOps widgets are combined for an overall view. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Here is an example of an Insights dashboard with data about vendors, technologies, services, instances, and other important details for DevOps teams. 5. Add alerts for cloud-based metrics When monitoring cloud-based services, it is essential to keep track of all changes to a system by alerting on them. Integrations with New Relic Infrastructure allow you to create alerts on the metrics that are the most important to you. Here is an example of a baseline alert that will notify you based on the number of requests received on all AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ALB) systems for the ALB monitoring integration: alerts.newrelic.com > Alert policies > (selected policy) > Alert conditions: Create a NRQL baseline alert to monitor the number of requests received your ALB systems. 6. Set up additional monitoring For full-stack visibility into every aspect of your app, we recommend deploying other types of New Relic monitoring: Use APM to report application-tier performance metrics. Use browser monitoring to report front-end web metrics. Use mobile monitoring to report front-end mobile app metrics. Use synthetic monitoring to monitor websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. 7. CI/CD pipeline integration It's important to track deployments and the impact that code and infrastructure changes have on your end-user experience. APM deployment markers allow you to record deployments for each application. A deployment marker is an event indicating that a deployment happened. You can pair markers with metadata from your source code management (SCM) system ( including user IDs, revisions, and change logs.). APM displays a vertical line, or marker, on charts and graphs at the deployment event's timestamp. When you hover over the line, APM displays the associated metadata for that deployment. Tracking deployments is an invaluable way to determine the root causes of immediate, long-term, or gradual degradations in your applications. Recommendation: Make POST requests to the New Relic REST API as the final step of a successful CI/CD deployment, as described in the API documentation. The following tools have integrations or plugins available to help automate CI/CD deployments: Chef (see newrelic_deployment) Jenkins Ansible Puppet 8. AWS Lambda Monitoring New Relic One features an updated APM agent that is highly optimized from a cost and time perspective for ephemeral Lambda functions. Enable New Relic monitoring of AWS Lambda to to assess invocations, error rate, function duration, cold starts, and more. You can also take advantage of New Relic's Infrastructure integration with Lambda for additional reporting capabilities.",

      "body": "In the cloud, it's important to look regularly and closely at how your applications and services are architected and utilized. It's the best way to identify opportunities that will let you right-size your instances, fine tune your databases, modify your storage usage, better configure your load balancers, or even re-architect your applications. For example, if you have a set of 20 instances all running at 10% CPU usage, you might consider using smaller instances or consolidating more work onto those instances. This kind of thinking about your cloud utilization and spend will help you optimize your environment and save money quickly. Optimizing your cloud architecture has three main goals: Improve performance, availability, and end-user experience by taking better advantage of cloud services Optimize your cloud spend, striking the delicate balance between cost and performance Capture business and technical metrics that help justify your current cloud spend that can be referenced as justification for a larger cloud budget as growth dictates In this tutorial, we'll show you how to use the New Relic platform to capture all the data you should leverage to optimize your cloud architecture and spend. 1. Instrument your application and cloud environment Make sure the following products and integrations are instrumented: Instrument Details Install Infrastructure Instrument infrastructure: If you haven't already done so, review the requirements for the Infrastructure agent. Infrastructure comes with several types of integrations, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and on-host integrations. After you've installed the Infrastructure agent on your host(s), you'll immediately have access to the broad spectrum of metrics the agent collects out-of-the-box. Install the APM agent Instrument your applications with APM. Doing so will let you monitor how your applications are performing while you are optimizing the underlying cloud services. That way, you can confirm that your changes to the infrastructure are in fact improving application performance. Configure the AWS integration New Relic Infrastructure's Amazon integrations let you monitor your AWS data in several New Relic products, including Infrastructure, dashboards, and New Relic Alerts. Connect AWS Billing If you are hosted in an AWS environment, New Relic can help you monitor your cloud spend with our AWS Billing integration. To leverage New Relic's AWS Billing integration, follow the procedures in the Connect AWS Billing documentation 2. Create dashboards to display baseline infrastructure metrics; include AWS budgets if available Dashboards lets you write powerful custom queries about your data and visualize the results in widgets displayed on a common dashboard. You can also feed the results of your queries directly into New Relic Alerts, where you can get immediate notifications on any deviation identified. For this step, you should display baseline infrastructure metrics related to performance and usage (CPU, memory, disk, database, etc.). Include AWS Budgets if available. To get you started, here are ways to use Insights dashboards to visualize your AWS cloud utilization and spend data: This dashboard shows data broken out by the applications and budgets you set up in the AWS budgeting area. Create individual dashboards for each application, and then collect those dashboards into a single “data app,” as shown here. This AWS Production Overview data app displays a set of widgets relevant to an AWS production budget. Data apps are great for presentations where you want to step through a series of topics and also provide a clear overview of an entire environment or service. Create dashboards for each level of your organization Whether you're a developer, operator, or executive, having information about your cloud utilization can help you optimize your cloud environment: Developers: Understanding what applications currently cost can help developers configure applications to use more services more efficiently. For example, could developers cut cloud costs using AWS Lambda or properly sized instances? Operators: Monitoring application utilization allows operators to catch possible overruns due to mis-configured services. For example, is the ops team's auto-scaling configuration scaling down properly? Executives: An overall view of both fore-casted and actual cloud spend, for individual applications, per region, and overall totals, can help executives make better business decisions. Use New Relic to keep track of your cloud spend, and make sure your teams get alerted immediately when you exceed thresholds. 3. Identify resources for optimization This step shows you how to use the metrics New Relic has captured to determine which resources to optimize. In the sample dashboard above, the CPU-usage widget on the left reveals that this application uses many instances sizes. Note that the “c4.xlarge” instance (in coral) consistently consumes only around 20% CPU capacity. However, when you analyze the c4.xlarge Memory usage in the center widget (light green), you'll see that memory usage for this instance ranges from 20% to 80%. This suggests that the application is more memory-intensive than CPU-intensive. In this case, the instance type should be changed from a compute-optimized instance to one that is memory-optimized. (Note: the chart on the right of the dashboard can be used to monitor the application's average response time as you make these optimizations.) This is just one example of how to identify cloud-based resources that could be candidates for optimization. Now that you've identified architecture for optimization, go ahead and do so. Whether you right-size your instances, fine tune your databases, modify your storage usage, better configure your load balancers, or even re-architect your applications, in the end your goal is to be able to compare your new, optimized architecture against the baselines you captured in Step 2. For more about baselines please review the Establish Objectives & Baselines tutorial. 4. Optional: Set up alerts You can create an alert condition for NRQL queries. Be sure to reference the complete documentation as needed. In the data app for the AWS production budget introduced in Step 2, this was one of the widgets: Here is the query that we used to create that widget: SELECT latest(`provider.actualAmount`) as '$ Actual', latest(`provider.forecastedAmount`) as '$ Forecast', max(`provider.limitAmount`) as '$ Limit' FROM FinanceSample WHERE provider = 'BillingBudget' AND `provider.budgetName` = '[Your Cloud Budget]' Copy If you can write queries on your data and show them in Insights, then you can easily use them to generate Alert conditions. Baseline queries New Relic also lets you write “baseline queries” against your data. These are queriesy you write without setting hard limits on the results. Rather, you let New Relic Applied Intelligence “machine-learn” your performance data, and then alert you when your data strays too far outside of your baseline numbers. To create a baseline query, head over the the Alert console, go into Alert policies, and add a New alert policy. Then follow these steps: Create alert policy. Give your policy a concise and descriptive name and select an Incident Preference. Then select Create alert policy. Create a condition. Select NRQL Define your query, and decide how restrictively Applied Intelligence should analyze your data using a simple slider and visualization based on your recent performance. The slider at the bottom of the chart either increases or decreases the gray band around your budget threshold (the blue line). The setting shown would have resulted in zero violations based on recent data, and that is what you're looking for. However, if that blue line spikes up or down out of the gray band, New Relic will immediately notify you. Using New Relic Applied Intelligence is a great way to help you proactively learn about your cloud spending or about any of your performance data.

      "body": "The term alerting often carries some negative connotations: many developers correlate alerting with errors, mistakes, and ongoing issues. However, developers who are proactive about alerting, know they don't have to stare at dashboards all day because effective alerts tell them when to check in. Well-defined alerts help you understand the health of your systems, so you can respond to performance problems before they affect your customers. Further, a focused alerts policy helps you pinpoint any degradation that could impact performance in your application or environment. With proactive alerting, you'll decrease user-reported incidents, and your teams will spend less time firefighting and more time deploying significant changes to your product. After you define the right alerts, proper incident orchestration aligns your teams, tools, and processes to prepare for incidents and outages in your software. The goal is to provide your teams a predictable framework and process to: Maximize efficiency in communication and effort. Minimize the overall impact to your business. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you have: Instrumented your applications in New Relic. Reviewed the Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. Optionally added custom attributes and events. 1. Define policies Define required alerting policies based on SLOs. A service level objective (SLO) is an agreed upon means of measuring the performance of your service. The SLO defines a target value of a specified quantitative measure, which is called a service level indicator (SLI). Examples of service level indicators could be average response time, response time percentile, and application availability. SLOs would then clarify a target value for those SLIs such as: Average response time should be less than 200 ms. 95% of requests should be completed within 250 ms. Availability of the service should be 99.99%. These SLOs can also be logically grouped together to provide an overall boolean indicator of whether the service is meeting expectations or not (for example, 95% of requests completed within 250 ms AND availability is 99.99%), which can be helpful for alerting purposes. Use these SLIs as key performance indicators (KPIs) so your team and organization can measure your service and ensure it's meeting customer expectations. By breaking down the quantitative performance metrics that are required of your services, you can then identify what kinds of alerts you should set for each. For instance, you could set an alert to notify you if web transaction times go above half a millisecond, or if the error rate goes higher than 0.20%. However, not every SLO needs to become an alert. A strong alerting strategy takes SLOs and creates a set of simple, actionable alerts. New Relic often finds that our most mature customers set fewer alerts in general and focus those alerts on a core set of metrics that indicate when their customer experience is truly degraded. As a result, New Relic customers often use Apdex as part of their alerting strategy to align alerts with signs of degraded user satisfaction. As you design your alerting strategy, keep this question in mind: “If the customer isn’t impacted, is it worth waking someone up?” Example questions and KPI solutions For a simple framework of areas to set alerts for, use the following questions and advised metrics and KPIs: Questions Metrics and KPIs Are we open for business? Use browser monitoring and APM to alert on site availability. How's our underlying infrastructure? Set KPIs for key hardware, network, and storage components. How's the health of our application? Track metrics for JVM performance, queuing, caching, and similar dependencies. How’s the overall quality of our application? Use an Apdex score to quickly access an application’s quality. How are our customers doing? Consider real end-user metrics (browser or APM), synthetic users (Synthetics), and Apdex scores. How's our overall business doing? Focus on key transactions within an application, and tie them to expected business outcomes to illustrate correlation between your application and business performance. 2. Set specific alerts Set specific alerts for performance, correctness, throughput, availability, and dependencies With New Relic you can set alerts on your instrumented applications, end-user experience, infrastructure, databases, and more. New Relic will alert you if your site's availability dips or if your error rate spikes above acceptable levels, as defined by your SLOs. You can set warning thresholds to monitor issues that may be approaching a critical severity but don't yet warrant a pager notification. Setting thresholds for when alerts should notify teams can be challenging. Thresholds that are too tight will create alert fatigue while thresholds that are too loose will lead to unhappy customers. Baseline alerts allow you to set dynamic thresholds for alerts based on historical performance. Use baselines to tune your alert to the right threshold. For example, an alert in APM can notify incident response teams if web transaction times deviate from historical performance for an allotted amount of time. alerts.newrelic.com > (selected alert policy) > (selected alert condition) > Define thresholds You can set this same kind of alert in browser to catch sub-optimal performance. In the following example, we've set both a warning and a violation for throughput: alerts.newrelic.com > (selected alert policy) > (selected alert condition) > Define thresholds As you develop smaller, independent services running on increasingly ephemeral architectures, your environments become significantly more complex. Visibility into outliers can be an important tool for understanding likely performance issues. You should set alerts to automatically fire when you have an outlier, which can indicate misbehaving hosts, load balancers, or apps. For example, a load balancer divides web traffic across five different servers. You can set an alert based on a NRQL query and receive a notification if any server starts getting significantly more or less traffic than the other servers. Here is an example chart: And here's a sample NRQL query: SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample WHERE apmApplicationNames = 'MY-APP-NAME' FACET hostname Copy Now you have set static, baseline, and outlier alerts. This can provide a comprehensive awareness of your ecosystem. Refer to the New Relic Alerts documentation for more details about optimizing your alerts. 3. Identify groups Identify groups to alert, set broadcasting methods, and assign first responders to team dashboards Alerting without the proper broadcasting methods leaves you vulnerable. Your alerting strategy should include a notification channel to ensure the appropriate teams are notified if your application or architecture encounters issues. New Relic has many notification integrations, but we recommend that you start simple and add more complexity later. We recommend that you first send alerts to a group chat channel (for example, using Slack or PagerDuty). Evaluate these alerts in real time for several weeks to understand which alerts are indicative of important or problematic issues. These are the types of alerts that warrant waking someone up. Recommendation: For each team dashboard, make sure: It has an owner who assumes responsibility for the health of the applications and features it monitors. There is no ambiguity about who is responsible for attending to and resolving an alert condition. This policy will vary between organizations depending on size, structure, and culture. For example, some teams may prefer to assign dashboards and alerts based on de-facto features or application ownership. Other teams may prefer to adopt an on-call rotation (often referred to as pager duty). In on-call rotations, designated team members handle all first-line incident responses, and they resolve or delegate responsibilities based on predetermined incident thresholds. 4. Determine thresholds Determine incident thresholds for alert conditions For each of your applications: Identify the thresholds for what is officially considered an incident. Make sure each set of threshold criteria is context-dependent. Document incident evaluation and known remediation procedures in runbooks. Include links to your runbooks when you define conditions and thresholds for your alert policies. For instance, a certain alert condition may be dismissable during low-traffic periods but require active remediation during peak hours. 5. Set notification channels Ensure alerts have auditable notification channels Make sure that communications during critical incidents take place in easily accessible and highly visible channels. A group chat room dedicated to incident communication is usually a great choice. This allows all stakeholders to participate or observe and provides a chronology of notifications, key decisions, and actions for postmortem analysis. Use any of the available notification channels in New Relic Alerts. For example, to set up a notification channel in Slack: Make sure your organization has completed New Relic's integration requirements with Slack. In the Slack app, select the dropdown in the top-left corner of the app, and select Customize Slack. Click Configure apps. From the list of app integrations, select New Relic. Expand the instructions for New Relic Alerts, and follow the steps to configure notifications from New Relic. 6. Automate resolution Automate triage and resolution steps Automation of simple or repeatable incident response tasks will increase efficiency and minimize the impact of incidents. With proper automation in place, you can disable or isolate faulty application components as soon as an alert threshold is reached, rather than after a notification has been issued. For example, a team managing an application for a digital media company wants to be able to remove commenting abilities from the website if the system has errors. In this case, they could: Add an endpoint to their front-end web application that will toggle a feature flag enabling or disabling the UI components associated with posting comments on an article. Create an alert policy with a threshold set on the sustained error rate in the commenting service. Assign a webhook notification channel that will send a POST request to this endpoint, as well as to the standard team notification channels. In this scenario, errors in the commenting system will trigger the webhook and remove the commenting UI from the website. Users can still use core functionality of the site without seeing errors generated by the commenting service. The application will maintain a stable but degraded state, allowing the team to focus on recovery without the pressure of preventing users from accessing the site. You can also use webhooks to create issues and action items in ticketing systems that have REST APIs, such as Zendesk. Use New Relic Alerts to create a webhook notification channel, and customize the webhook payload as needed. New Relic also provides integrations for common ticketing systems. You can use any of these integrations to file tickets from APM. 7. Establish reviews Establish a post mortem process After the incident has been resolved, key stakeholders and participants must capture accurate and thorough documentation of the incident. At a minimum, we recommend that the retro documentation includes: A root cause analysis A chronology and summary of remediation steps and their result, whether they were successful or not A measure of the impact to the business in terms of user experience and financial losses, if possible Recommendations for system or feature improvements to prevent a recurrence Recommendations for process and communication improvements Store post mortem reports in a highly visible, searchable repository, such as a shared drive folder or wiki. Culturally, it's essential that this process focuses on constructive learning and improvement rather than punishment or blame. Example post mortem report Here is a brief example of a post mortem report: Post mortem Comments Date March 1, 2018 Executive summary From approximately 1:45PM until 2:30PM, users could not add items to their carts, which prevented any checkouts from occurring during the incident period. Root cause We determined that a change was made to the CSS rules on the product detail page that effectively disabled the Add to cart button. Timeline 1:50PM: Successful checkouts < 10 for 5 minutes alert triggered; assigned to Alice. 1:55PM: After reviewing the ecommerce team dashboard, Alice determined that the threshold was breached immediately following a deploy by Bob. She notified him of the incident. 2:00PM: Alice and Bob began troubleshooting. Attempts at recreating the issue in production were successful. 2:20PM: Bob determined that his change to the CSS on the product detail page disabled the Add to cart button. He deployed a hotfix. 2:30PM: Functionality was restored and the incident was resolved. Impact No checkouts were completed during the duration of the incident. Our typical revenue for a Thursday during this timeframe is $30,000. Recommendations We have been discussing implementing New Relic Synthetics for awhile now. If we had a Synthetic check on the checkout process, this issue would have been detected immediately. We should also implement more thorough unit tests in the front-end web app. 8. Fine-tune process Fine-tune alerts and thresholds As you use New Relic to optimize your application and infrastructure performance, tighten your New Relic Alerts policy conditions to keep pace with your improved performance. When rolling out new code or modifications that could negatively impact performance over a period of time, loosen your threshold conditions to allow for these short-term changes. For instance, we recommend using pre-established baselines and thresholds to increase efficiency during high-impact times for your business, such as annual events and major releases. Fine-tuning gives you the flexibility you need to increase efficiencies and extend your notification channels. As noted earlier, we recommend you start with a group chat service when you first establish notifications. Once you've identified other tools you'd like to integrate with, set up a notification channel to maintain your momentum. Tools such as xMatters and PagerDuty provide popular integrations, but don't overlook simple methods, such as webhooks. The goal is to continuously improve your alerting scheme. Be sure to check your alerts and confirm that they're firing regularly and are still relevant for your customer satisfaction metrics. Use the New Relic platform to create dashboards centered around alerts and incidents for the most common policy conditions and violations. insights.newrelic.com > All dashboards > (selected dashboard) Use the New Relic query language and the Insights query API to create your dashboards. The dashboard above was created using the following NRQL queries. It's recommended you recreate them as needed for your alerting dashboards. Incidents by condition: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state = 'open' FACET condition_name SINCE 1 week ago Copy Incidents by policy: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME where current_state = 'open' FACET policy_name SINCE 60 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Alert trends over time: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state IS NOT NULL FACET policy_name SINCE 1 week ago TIMESERIES Copy Incident details: SELECT timestamp, incident_id, policy_name, condition_name, details, severity FROM ALERT_NAME SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 40 Copy Visualizing this data provides a resource you can share with others to refine the alerts and thresholds you're using. Expert tip In addition to instrumenting and measuring application and infrastructure metrics, mature DevOps organizations often measure and optimize the efficiency of incident response processes. For example, you can use webhooks to send alert events to New Relic Insights. This allows you to supplement your team dashboards with New Relic Alerts data.",

      "body": "Whether you've recently completed your cloud migration, have been using cloud-based services for a while, or have always been in the cloud, you may find yourself deploying modern, cutting-edge technologies and services. It's important to develop the ability to adopt new services easily and with confidence; innovation never stops for companies operating in the cloud, and a company's willingness to embrace new technology can give it a major competitive differentiator. These modern technologies could be container solutions such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Amazon AWS ECS or Fargate, for example. Or they could be serverless services such as AWS Lambda, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform Functions. They may be cloud-based databases, or any number of cloud services that abstract the service away from an operations-maintained infrastructure. In these situations, you want to monitor, query, and alert on the performance and usage metrics for both modern technologies and cloud-based services. This allows your team to deploy faster, to adopt new services with confidence, to make better business decisions, and in general to expand its technology horizons. Here are the steps to using the New Relic Platform to monitor your modern technologies and cloud services: 1. Identify services and technologies Determine the components you need to monitor by answering the following questions: What cloud-based applications do I have? What are the underlying cloud-based services, technologies, and infrastructure supporting those applications? When you have a full understanding of your architecture, you reduce the possibility of missing dependencies and new services that might impact your organization's application environment. 2. Deploy New Relic Infrastructure After reviewing the requirements for New Relic Infrastructure, install the Infrastructure agent on the hosts you identified in Step One so that you can monitor your cloud services. If you use Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for automation, you can use those tools to deploy Infrastructure agents to your hosts. 3. Configure cloud integrations As you integrate new cloud services, you can use New Relic to monitor and report data about these services; giving you a single, comprehensive overview of your entire architecture. To configure cloud service integrations, link your Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service provider account with New Relic. 4. Track data on your dashboards New Relic Infrastructure integrations auto-populate dashboards with metrics from cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP so you can track the data that is critical to your cloud adoption success. Tip If you adopt a hybrid cloud of multiple cloud providers, New Relic can provide a holistic perspective that is agnostic to cloud providers. AWS EC2 monitoring integration dashboard In this default dashboard for the AWS EC2 monitoring integration, New Relic captures metrics for EC2 instances per region, instance state, and instance type. The dashboard also shows inventory for different software packages and configurations that are installed on those instances. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Integrations > Amazon Web Services: View AWS EC2 data on the default dashboard for the AWS EC2 monitoring integration. Azure VMs monitoring integration dashboard The default Azure virtual machine integration dashboard shows data for VM sizes, VMs per region, and VMs per resource group. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Integrations > Microsoft Azure: View Azure virtual machine data on the default dashboard for the Azure VMs monitoring integration. GCP Compute Engine monitoring integration dashboard In this default dashboard for the Google Cloud Platform, New Relic captures metrics for instances per zone, instance status, firewall dropped packets, reserved cores, and disk throttled operations. The dashboard also shows inventory for different software packages and configurations that are installed on those instances. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Integrations > Google Cloud Platform: View GCP Compute Engine data on the default dashboard for the GCP Compute Engine monitoring integration. Example modern and cloud services dashboard In this example dashboard, three different cloud vendors, modern technologies, cloud services, infrastructure instance locations, and DevOps widgets are combined for an overall view. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Here is an example of an Insights dashboard with data about vendors, technologies, services, instances, and other important details for DevOps teams. 5. Add alerts for cloud-based metrics When monitoring cloud-based services, it is essential to keep track of all changes to a system by alerting on them. Integrations with New Relic Infrastructure allow you to create alerts on the metrics that are the most important to you. Here is an example of a baseline alert that will notify you based on the number of requests received on all AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ALB) systems for the ALB monitoring integration: alerts.newrelic.com > Alert policies > (selected policy) > Alert conditions: Create a NRQL baseline alert to monitor the number of requests received your ALB systems. 6. Set up additional monitoring For full-stack visibility into every aspect of your app, we recommend deploying other types of New Relic monitoring: Use APM to report application-tier performance metrics. Use browser monitoring to report front-end web metrics. Use mobile monitoring to report front-end mobile app metrics. Use synthetic monitoring to monitor websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. 7. CI/CD pipeline integration It's important to track deployments and the impact that code and infrastructure changes have on your end-user experience. APM deployment markers allow you to record deployments for each application. A deployment marker is an event indicating that a deployment happened. You can pair markers with metadata from your source code management (SCM) system ( including user IDs, revisions, and change logs.). APM displays a vertical line, or marker, on charts and graphs at the deployment event's timestamp. When you hover over the line, APM displays the associated metadata for that deployment. Tracking deployments is an invaluable way to determine the root causes of immediate, long-term, or gradual degradations in your applications. Recommendation: Make POST requests to the New Relic REST API as the final step of a successful CI/CD deployment, as described in the API documentation. The following tools have integrations or plugins available to help automate CI/CD deployments: Chef (see newrelic_deployment) Jenkins Ansible Puppet 8. AWS Lambda Monitoring New Relic One features an updated APM agent that is highly optimized from a cost and time perspective for ephemeral Lambda functions. Enable New Relic monitoring of AWS Lambda to to assess invocations, error rate, function duration, cold starts, and more. You can also take advantage of New Relic's Infrastructure integration with Lambda for additional reporting capabilities.",

Capturing tangible, measurable metrics from before and after each change allows teams to optimize changes in isolation and reduce the impact to other work happening in the system. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, complete the Establish objectives and baselines. 1. Integrate measurements into your development process With appropriate measurements incorporated into all phases of your development cycle, you can surface errors and performance issues before your customers uncover them. As your application teams plan their work, use your KPI dashboards in daily stand-ups and other planning meetings to analyze necessary debugging work, assess whether recent deployments were successful, and prioritize other work efforts. When development and operations teams use dashboards during planning and discussions, they ensure that they're consistently incorporating feedback about customer experiences and reliability risks into their development efforts. For proper testing, ensure that instrumentation in your pre-production environments is in parity with your production environments. Use dashboards to compare the environments and verify that the code and infrastructure changes you make across them are correct, and eliminate any anomalies before pushing code to production. Beyond using instrumentation to measure software performance, also use it to analyze team efficiency. For example, with your alerts data, use NRQL and external integrations to calculate mean time to repair (MTTR) by subtracting the difference in event timestamps as the current state of each event changes from OPEN to ACKNOWLEDGED to CLOSED. Or push events into Insights from a source code management (SCM) system like GitHub, and calculate the amount of time it takes a code change to go live by comparing the timestamp of a commit event to that of a deploy event. Plotted over time, this could become a KPI in a DevOps transformation. 2. Add automated deployment markers It's important to track deployments and the impact code and infrastructure changes have on your end-user experience. Using deployment markers in APM, you can record deployments for each application. A deployment marker is an event indicating that a deployment happened, and it's paired with metadata available from your SCM system (for example, the user, revision, or change-log). APM displays a vertical line, or “marker,” on charts and graphs at the deployment event's timestamp. When you hover over the line, APM displays the associated metadata for that deployment. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview APM also provides a chronological list of deployments of your application. Additional metrics, such as error rate and Apdex from the time of the deployment, are available as well. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Deployments Tracking deployments is a valuable way to determine the root cause of immediate, long-term, or gradual degradations in your application. New Relic recommends that you make POST requests to the New Relic REST API as the final step of a successful CI/CD deployment as described in the API documentation. The following tools have integrations or plugins available to help automate this: Chef (see newrelic_deployment) Jenkins Ansible Puppet 3. Test your pipeline with Infrastructure An important part of optimizing your cloud native environment is a making a cultural shift toward smaller, more frequent changes to your code and infrastructure. After you complete the first two steps of this tutorial, begin to test and gather appropriate performance insights about your deployment pipeline to more clearly understand the impact of the changes you make. Code changes should be as small as possible in terms of the number of lines of code and source files you change. Changes should also involve as few team members as possible. This makes it much easier to identify issue owners and determine root causes if errors occur. Similarly, infrastructure changes should also have as small a footprint as possible to minimize the number of applications affected by each change. New Relic Infrastructure helps you see when an infrastructure change has caused a spike in issues, as shown in the following example: one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts For cloud infrastructure changes or larger code changes, consider using a blue/green deployment strategy. APM supports multiple app names, which is a good fit for this model. To implement this strategy: Deploy a version of your application to existing infrastructure using a rollup app name that signifies it as the “blue” version (or control version). Deploy a new version of your application to a subset of the infrastructure (or an alternate set of infrastructure) with a rollup name that signifies this as the “green” version (or experimental version). Ensure that traffic is routed appropriately between both versions. Compare established KPI dashboards of both versions against one another. Optimize the new version accordingly to meet your KPI targets. When you're satisfied with the application's performance, deploy the new version across your infrastructure using the original app name, and consider this the new baseline for any future changes you'll make to the application.",

      "body": "The term alerting often carries some negative connotations: many developers correlate alerting with errors, mistakes, and ongoing issues. However, developers who are proactive about alerting, know they don't have to stare at dashboards all day because effective alerts tell them when to check in. Well-defined alerts help you understand the health of your systems, so you can respond to performance problems before they affect your customers. Further, a focused alerts policy helps you pinpoint any degradation that could impact performance in your application or environment. With proactive alerting, you'll decrease user-reported incidents, and your teams will spend less time firefighting and more time deploying significant changes to your product. After you define the right alerts, proper incident orchestration aligns your teams, tools, and processes to prepare for incidents and outages in your software. The goal is to provide your teams a predictable framework and process to: Maximize efficiency in communication and effort. Minimize the overall impact to your business. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you have: Instrumented your applications in New Relic. Reviewed the Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. Optionally added custom attributes and events. 1. Define policies Define required alerting policies based on SLOs. A service level objective (SLO) is an agreed upon means of measuring the performance of your service. The SLO defines a target value of a specified quantitative measure, which is called a service level indicator (SLI). Examples of service level indicators could be average response time, response time percentile, and application availability. SLOs would then clarify a target value for those SLIs such as: Average response time should be less than 200 ms. 95% of requests should be completed within 250 ms. Availability of the service should be 99.99%. These SLOs can also be logically grouped together to provide an overall boolean indicator of whether the service is meeting expectations or not (for example, 95% of requests completed within 250 ms AND availability is 99.99%), which can be helpful for alerting purposes. Use these SLIs as key performance indicators (KPIs) so your team and organization can measure your service and ensure it's meeting customer expectations. By breaking down the quantitative performance metrics that are required of your services, you can then identify what kinds of alerts you should set for each. For instance, you could set an alert to notify you if web transaction times go above half a millisecond, or if the error rate goes higher than 0.20%. However, not every SLO needs to become an alert. A strong alerting strategy takes SLOs and creates a set of simple, actionable alerts. New Relic often finds that our most mature customers set fewer alerts in general and focus those alerts on a core set of metrics that indicate when their customer experience is truly degraded. As a result, New Relic customers often use Apdex as part of their alerting strategy to align alerts with signs of degraded user satisfaction. As you design your alerting strategy, keep this question in mind: “If the customer isn’t impacted, is it worth waking someone up?” Example questions and KPI solutions For a simple framework of areas to set alerts for, use the following questions and advised metrics and KPIs: Questions Metrics and KPIs Are we open for business? Use browser monitoring and APM to alert on site availability. How's our underlying infrastructure? Set KPIs for key hardware, network, and storage components. How's the health of our application? Track metrics for JVM performance, queuing, caching, and similar dependencies. How’s the overall quality of our application? Use an Apdex score to quickly access an application’s quality. How are our customers doing? Consider real end-user metrics (browser or APM), synthetic users (Synthetics), and Apdex scores. How's our overall business doing? Focus on key transactions within an application, and tie them to expected business outcomes to illustrate correlation between your application and business performance. 2. Set specific alerts Set specific alerts for performance, correctness, throughput, availability, and dependencies With New Relic you can set alerts on your instrumented applications, end-user experience, infrastructure, databases, and more. New Relic will alert you if your site's availability dips or if your error rate spikes above acceptable levels, as defined by your SLOs. You can set warning thresholds to monitor issues that may be approaching a critical severity but don't yet warrant a pager notification. Setting thresholds for when alerts should notify teams can be challenging. Thresholds that are too tight will create alert fatigue while thresholds that are too loose will lead to unhappy customers. Baseline alerts allow you to set dynamic thresholds for alerts based on historical performance. Use baselines to tune your alert to the right threshold. For example, an alert in APM can notify incident response teams if web transaction times deviate from historical performance for an allotted amount of time. alerts.newrelic.com > (selected alert policy) > (selected alert condition) > Define thresholds You can set this same kind of alert in browser to catch sub-optimal performance. In the following example, we've set both a warning and a violation for throughput: alerts.newrelic.com > (selected alert policy) > (selected alert condition) > Define thresholds As you develop smaller, independent services running on increasingly ephemeral architectures, your environments become significantly more complex. Visibility into outliers can be an important tool for understanding likely performance issues. You should set alerts to automatically fire when you have an outlier, which can indicate misbehaving hosts, load balancers, or apps. For example, a load balancer divides web traffic across five different servers. You can set an alert based on a NRQL query and receive a notification if any server starts getting significantly more or less traffic than the other servers. Here is an example chart: And here's a sample NRQL query: SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample WHERE apmApplicationNames = 'MY-APP-NAME' FACET hostname Copy Now you have set static, baseline, and outlier alerts. This can provide a comprehensive awareness of your ecosystem. Refer to the New Relic Alerts documentation for more details about optimizing your alerts. 3. Identify groups Identify groups to alert, set broadcasting methods, and assign first responders to team dashboards Alerting without the proper broadcasting methods leaves you vulnerable. Your alerting strategy should include a notification channel to ensure the appropriate teams are notified if your application or architecture encounters issues. New Relic has many notification integrations, but we recommend that you start simple and add more complexity later. We recommend that you first send alerts to a group chat channel (for example, using Slack or PagerDuty). Evaluate these alerts in real time for several weeks to understand which alerts are indicative of important or problematic issues. These are the types of alerts that warrant waking someone up. Recommendation: For each team dashboard, make sure: It has an owner who assumes responsibility for the health of the applications and features it monitors. There is no ambiguity about who is responsible for attending to and resolving an alert condition. This policy will vary between organizations depending on size, structure, and culture. For example, some teams may prefer to assign dashboards and alerts based on de-facto features or application ownership. Other teams may prefer to adopt an on-call rotation (often referred to as pager duty). In on-call rotations, designated team members handle all first-line incident responses, and they resolve or delegate responsibilities based on predetermined incident thresholds. 4. Determine thresholds Determine incident thresholds for alert conditions For each of your applications: Identify the thresholds for what is officially considered an incident. Make sure each set of threshold criteria is context-dependent. Document incident evaluation and known remediation procedures in runbooks. Include links to your runbooks when you define conditions and thresholds for your alert policies. For instance, a certain alert condition may be dismissable during low-traffic periods but require active remediation during peak hours. 5. Set notification channels Ensure alerts have auditable notification channels Make sure that communications during critical incidents take place in easily accessible and highly visible channels. A group chat room dedicated to incident communication is usually a great choice. This allows all stakeholders to participate or observe and provides a chronology of notifications, key decisions, and actions for postmortem analysis. Use any of the available notification channels in New Relic Alerts. For example, to set up a notification channel in Slack: Make sure your organization has completed New Relic's integration requirements with Slack. In the Slack app, select the dropdown in the top-left corner of the app, and select Customize Slack. Click Configure apps. From the list of app integrations, select New Relic. Expand the instructions for New Relic Alerts, and follow the steps to configure notifications from New Relic. 6. Automate resolution Automate triage and resolution steps Automation of simple or repeatable incident response tasks will increase efficiency and minimize the impact of incidents. With proper automation in place, you can disable or isolate faulty application components as soon as an alert threshold is reached, rather than after a notification has been issued. For example, a team managing an application for a digital media company wants to be able to remove commenting abilities from the website if the system has errors. In this case, they could: Add an endpoint to their front-end web application that will toggle a feature flag enabling or disabling the UI components associated with posting comments on an article. Create an alert policy with a threshold set on the sustained error rate in the commenting service. Assign a webhook notification channel that will send a POST request to this endpoint, as well as to the standard team notification channels. In this scenario, errors in the commenting system will trigger the webhook and remove the commenting UI from the website. Users can still use core functionality of the site without seeing errors generated by the commenting service. The application will maintain a stable but degraded state, allowing the team to focus on recovery without the pressure of preventing users from accessing the site. You can also use webhooks to create issues and action items in ticketing systems that have REST APIs, such as Zendesk. Use New Relic Alerts to create a webhook notification channel, and customize the webhook payload as needed. New Relic also provides integrations for common ticketing systems. You can use any of these integrations to file tickets from APM. 7. Establish reviews Establish a post mortem process After the incident has been resolved, key stakeholders and participants must capture accurate and thorough documentation of the incident. At a minimum, we recommend that the retro documentation includes: A root cause analysis A chronology and summary of remediation steps and their result, whether they were successful or not A measure of the impact to the business in terms of user experience and financial losses, if possible Recommendations for system or feature improvements to prevent a recurrence Recommendations for process and communication improvements Store post mortem reports in a highly visible, searchable repository, such as a shared drive folder or wiki. Culturally, it's essential that this process focuses on constructive learning and improvement rather than punishment or blame. Example post mortem report Here is a brief example of a post mortem report: Post mortem Comments Date March 1, 2018 Executive summary From approximately 1:45PM until 2:30PM, users could not add items to their carts, which prevented any checkouts from occurring during the incident period. Root cause We determined that a change was made to the CSS rules on the product detail page that effectively disabled the Add to cart button. Timeline 1:50PM: Successful checkouts < 10 for 5 minutes alert triggered; assigned to Alice. 1:55PM: After reviewing the ecommerce team dashboard, Alice determined that the threshold was breached immediately following a deploy by Bob. She notified him of the incident. 2:00PM: Alice and Bob began troubleshooting. Attempts at recreating the issue in production were successful. 2:20PM: Bob determined that his change to the CSS on the product detail page disabled the Add to cart button. He deployed a hotfix. 2:30PM: Functionality was restored and the incident was resolved. Impact No checkouts were completed during the duration of the incident. Our typical revenue for a Thursday during this timeframe is $30,000. Recommendations We have been discussing implementing New Relic Synthetics for awhile now. If we had a Synthetic check on the checkout process, this issue would have been detected immediately. We should also implement more thorough unit tests in the front-end web app. 8. Fine-tune process Fine-tune alerts and thresholds As you use New Relic to optimize your application and infrastructure performance, tighten your New Relic Alerts policy conditions to keep pace with your improved performance. When rolling out new code or modifications that could negatively impact performance over a period of time, loosen your threshold conditions to allow for these short-term changes. For instance, we recommend using pre-established baselines and thresholds to increase efficiency during high-impact times for your business, such as annual events and major releases. Fine-tuning gives you the flexibility you need to increase efficiencies and extend your notification channels. As noted earlier, we recommend you start with a group chat service when you first establish notifications. Once you've identified other tools you'd like to integrate with, set up a notification channel to maintain your momentum. Tools such as xMatters and PagerDuty provide popular integrations, but don't overlook simple methods, such as webhooks. The goal is to continuously improve your alerting scheme. Be sure to check your alerts and confirm that they're firing regularly and are still relevant for your customer satisfaction metrics. Use the New Relic platform to create dashboards centered around alerts and incidents for the most common policy conditions and violations. insights.newrelic.com > All dashboards > (selected dashboard) Use the New Relic query language and the Insights query API to create your dashboards. The dashboard above was created using the following NRQL queries. It's recommended you recreate them as needed for your alerting dashboards. Incidents by condition: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state = 'open' FACET condition_name SINCE 1 week ago Copy Incidents by policy: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME where current_state = 'open' FACET policy_name SINCE 60 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Alert trends over time: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state IS NOT NULL FACET policy_name SINCE 1 week ago TIMESERIES Copy Incident details: SELECT timestamp, incident_id, policy_name, condition_name, details, severity FROM ALERT_NAME SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 40 Copy Visualizing this data provides a resource you can share with others to refine the alerts and thresholds you're using. Expert tip In addition to instrumenting and measuring application and infrastructure metrics, mature DevOps organizations often measure and optimize the efficiency of incident response processes. For example, you can use webhooks to send alert events to New Relic Insights. This allows you to supplement your team dashboards with New Relic Alerts data.",

      "body": "Whether you've recently completed your cloud migration, have been using cloud-based services for a while, or have always been in the cloud, you may find yourself deploying modern, cutting-edge technologies and services. It's important to develop the ability to adopt new services easily and with confidence; innovation never stops for companies operating in the cloud, and a company's willingness to embrace new technology can give it a major competitive differentiator. These modern technologies could be container solutions such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Amazon AWS ECS or Fargate, for example. Or they could be serverless services such as AWS Lambda, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform Functions. They may be cloud-based databases, or any number of cloud services that abstract the service away from an operations-maintained infrastructure. In these situations, you want to monitor, query, and alert on the performance and usage metrics for both modern technologies and cloud-based services. This allows your team to deploy faster, to adopt new services with confidence, to make better business decisions, and in general to expand its technology horizons. Here are the steps to using the New Relic Platform to monitor your modern technologies and cloud services: 1. Identify services and technologies Determine the components you need to monitor by answering the following questions: What cloud-based applications do I have? What are the underlying cloud-based services, technologies, and infrastructure supporting those applications? When you have a full understanding of your architecture, you reduce the possibility of missing dependencies and new services that might impact your organization's application environment. 2. Deploy New Relic Infrastructure After reviewing the requirements for New Relic Infrastructure, install the Infrastructure agent on the hosts you identified in Step One so that you can monitor your cloud services. If you use Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for automation, you can use those tools to deploy Infrastructure agents to your hosts. 3. Configure cloud integrations As you integrate new cloud services, you can use New Relic to monitor and report data about these services; giving you a single, comprehensive overview of your entire architecture. To configure cloud service integrations, link your Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service provider account with New Relic. 4. Track data on your dashboards New Relic Infrastructure integrations auto-populate dashboards with metrics from cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP so you can track the data that is critical to your cloud adoption success. Tip If you adopt a hybrid cloud of multiple cloud providers, New Relic can provide a holistic perspective that is agnostic to cloud providers. AWS EC2 monitoring integration dashboard In this default dashboard for the AWS EC2 monitoring integration, New Relic captures metrics for EC2 instances per region, instance state, and instance type. The dashboard also shows inventory for different software packages and configurations that are installed on those instances. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Integrations > Amazon Web Services: View AWS EC2 data on the default dashboard for the AWS EC2 monitoring integration. Azure VMs monitoring integration dashboard The default Azure virtual machine integration dashboard shows data for VM sizes, VMs per region, and VMs per resource group. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Integrations > Microsoft Azure: View Azure virtual machine data on the default dashboard for the Azure VMs monitoring integration. GCP Compute Engine monitoring integration dashboard In this default dashboard for the Google Cloud Platform, New Relic captures metrics for instances per zone, instance status, firewall dropped packets, reserved cores, and disk throttled operations. The dashboard also shows inventory for different software packages and configurations that are installed on those instances. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Integrations > Google Cloud Platform: View GCP Compute Engine data on the default dashboard for the GCP Compute Engine monitoring integration. Example modern and cloud services dashboard In this example dashboard, three different cloud vendors, modern technologies, cloud services, infrastructure instance locations, and DevOps widgets are combined for an overall view. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Here is an example of an Insights dashboard with data about vendors, technologies, services, instances, and other important details for DevOps teams. 5. Add alerts for cloud-based metrics When monitoring cloud-based services, it is essential to keep track of all changes to a system by alerting on them. Integrations with New Relic Infrastructure allow you to create alerts on the metrics that are the most important to you. Here is an example of a baseline alert that will notify you based on the number of requests received on all AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ALB) systems for the ALB monitoring integration: alerts.newrelic.com > Alert policies > (selected policy) > Alert conditions: Create a NRQL baseline alert to monitor the number of requests received your ALB systems. 6. Set up additional monitoring For full-stack visibility into every aspect of your app, we recommend deploying other types of New Relic monitoring: Use APM to report application-tier performance metrics. Use browser monitoring to report front-end web metrics. Use mobile monitoring to report front-end mobile app metrics. Use synthetic monitoring to monitor websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. 7. CI/CD pipeline integration It's important to track deployments and the impact that code and infrastructure changes have on your end-user experience. APM deployment markers allow you to record deployments for each application. A deployment marker is an event indicating that a deployment happened. You can pair markers with metadata from your source code management (SCM) system ( including user IDs, revisions, and change logs.). APM displays a vertical line, or marker, on charts and graphs at the deployment event's timestamp. When you hover over the line, APM displays the associated metadata for that deployment. Tracking deployments is an invaluable way to determine the root causes of immediate, long-term, or gradual degradations in your applications. Recommendation: Make POST requests to the New Relic REST API as the final step of a successful CI/CD deployment, as described in the API documentation. The following tools have integrations or plugins available to help automate CI/CD deployments: Chef (see newrelic_deployment) Jenkins Ansible Puppet 8. AWS Lambda Monitoring New Relic One features an updated APM agent that is highly optimized from a cost and time perspective for ephemeral Lambda functions. Enable New Relic monitoring of AWS Lambda to to assess invocations, error rate, function duration, cold starts, and more. You can also take advantage of New Relic's Infrastructure integration with Lambda for additional reporting capabilities.",

      "body": "Proper instrumentation gives teams full visibility into the impact of the changes they make in a system. Capturing tangible, measurable metrics from before and after each change allows teams to optimize changes in isolation and reduce the impact to other work happening in the system. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, complete the Establish objectives and baselines. 1. Integrate measurements into your development process With appropriate measurements incorporated into all phases of your development cycle, you can surface errors and performance issues before your customers uncover them. As your application teams plan their work, use your KPI dashboards in daily stand-ups and other planning meetings to analyze necessary debugging work, assess whether recent deployments were successful, and prioritize other work efforts. When development and operations teams use dashboards during planning and discussions, they ensure that they're consistently incorporating feedback about customer experiences and reliability risks into their development efforts. For proper testing, ensure that instrumentation in your pre-production environments is in parity with your production environments. Use dashboards to compare the environments and verify that the code and infrastructure changes you make across them are correct, and eliminate any anomalies before pushing code to production. Beyond using instrumentation to measure software performance, also use it to analyze team efficiency. For example, with your alerts data, use NRQL and external integrations to calculate mean time to repair (MTTR) by subtracting the difference in event timestamps as the current state of each event changes from OPEN to ACKNOWLEDGED to CLOSED. Or push events into Insights from a source code management (SCM) system like GitHub, and calculate the amount of time it takes a code change to go live by comparing the timestamp of a commit event to that of a deploy event. Plotted over time, this could become a KPI in a DevOps transformation. 2. Add automated deployment markers It's important to track deployments and the impact code and infrastructure changes have on your end-user experience. Using deployment markers in APM, you can record deployments for each application. A deployment marker is an event indicating that a deployment happened, and it's paired with metadata available from your SCM system (for example, the user, revision, or change-log). APM displays a vertical line, or “marker,” on charts and graphs at the deployment event's timestamp. When you hover over the line, APM displays the associated metadata for that deployment. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview APM also provides a chronological list of deployments of your application. Additional metrics, such as error rate and Apdex from the time of the deployment, are available as well. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Deployments Tracking deployments is a valuable way to determine the root cause of immediate, long-term, or gradual degradations in your application. New Relic recommends that you make POST requests to the New Relic REST API as the final step of a successful CI/CD deployment as described in the API documentation. The following tools have integrations or plugins available to help automate this: Chef (see newrelic_deployment) Jenkins Ansible Puppet 3. Test your pipeline with Infrastructure An important part of optimizing your cloud native environment is a making a cultural shift toward smaller, more frequent changes to your code and infrastructure. After you complete the first two steps of this tutorial, begin to test and gather appropriate performance insights about your deployment pipeline to more clearly understand the impact of the changes you make. Code changes should be as small as possible in terms of the number of lines of code and source files you change. Changes should also involve as few team members as possible. This makes it much easier to identify issue owners and determine root causes if errors occur. Similarly, infrastructure changes should also have as small a footprint as possible to minimize the number of applications affected by each change. New Relic Infrastructure helps you see when an infrastructure change has caused a spike in issues, as shown in the following example: one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts For cloud infrastructure changes or larger code changes, consider using a blue/green deployment strategy. APM supports multiple app names, which is a good fit for this model. To implement this strategy: Deploy a version of your application to existing infrastructure using a rollup app name that signifies it as the “blue” version (or control version). Deploy a new version of your application to a subset of the infrastructure (or an alternate set of infrastructure) with a rollup name that signifies this as the “green” version (or experimental version). Ensure that traffic is routed appropriately between both versions. Compare established KPI dashboards of both versions against one another. Optimize the new version accordingly to meet your KPI targets. When you're satisfied with the application's performance, deploy the new version across your infrastructure using the original app name, and consider this the new baseline for any future changes you'll make to the application.",

      "body": "The term alerting often carries some negative connotations: many developers correlate alerting with errors, mistakes, and ongoing issues. However, developers who are proactive about alerting, know they don't have to stare at dashboards all day because effective alerts tell them when to check in. Well-defined alerts help you understand the health of your systems, so you can respond to performance problems before they affect your customers. Further, a focused alerts policy helps you pinpoint any degradation that could impact performance in your application or environment. With proactive alerting, you'll decrease user-reported incidents, and your teams will spend less time firefighting and more time deploying significant changes to your product. After you define the right alerts, proper incident orchestration aligns your teams, tools, and processes to prepare for incidents and outages in your software. The goal is to provide your teams a predictable framework and process to: Maximize efficiency in communication and effort. Minimize the overall impact to your business. Prerequisites This tutorial assumes you have: Instrumented your applications in New Relic. Reviewed the Establish objectives and baselines tutorial. Optionally added custom attributes and events. 1. Define policies Define required alerting policies based on SLOs. A service level objective (SLO) is an agreed upon means of measuring the performance of your service. The SLO defines a target value of a specified quantitative measure, which is called a service level indicator (SLI). Examples of service level indicators could be average response time, response time percentile, and application availability. SLOs would then clarify a target value for those SLIs such as: Average response time should be less than 200 ms. 95% of requests should be completed within 250 ms. Availability of the service should be 99.99%. These SLOs can also be logically grouped together to provide an overall boolean indicator of whether the service is meeting expectations or not (for example, 95% of requests completed within 250 ms AND availability is 99.99%), which can be helpful for alerting purposes. Use these SLIs as key performance indicators (KPIs) so your team and organization can measure your service and ensure it's meeting customer expectations. By breaking down the quantitative performance metrics that are required of your services, you can then identify what kinds of alerts you should set for each. For instance, you could set an alert to notify you if web transaction times go above half a millisecond, or if the error rate goes higher than 0.20%. However, not every SLO needs to become an alert. A strong alerting strategy takes SLOs and creates a set of simple, actionable alerts. New Relic often finds that our most mature customers set fewer alerts in general and focus those alerts on a core set of metrics that indicate when their customer experience is truly degraded. As a result, New Relic customers often use Apdex as part of their alerting strategy to align alerts with signs of degraded user satisfaction. As you design your alerting strategy, keep this question in mind: “If the customer isn’t impacted, is it worth waking someone up?” Example questions and KPI solutions For a simple framework of areas to set alerts for, use the following questions and advised metrics and KPIs: Questions Metrics and KPIs Are we open for business? Use browser monitoring and APM to alert on site availability. How's our underlying infrastructure? Set KPIs for key hardware, network, and storage components. How's the health of our application? Track metrics for JVM performance, queuing, caching, and similar dependencies. How’s the overall quality of our application? Use an Apdex score to quickly access an application’s quality. How are our customers doing? Consider real end-user metrics (browser or APM), synthetic users (Synthetics), and Apdex scores. How's our overall business doing? Focus on key transactions within an application, and tie them to expected business outcomes to illustrate correlation between your application and business performance. 2. Set specific alerts Set specific alerts for performance, correctness, throughput, availability, and dependencies With New Relic you can set alerts on your instrumented applications, end-user experience, infrastructure, databases, and more. New Relic will alert you if your site's availability dips or if your error rate spikes above acceptable levels, as defined by your SLOs. You can set warning thresholds to monitor issues that may be approaching a critical severity but don't yet warrant a pager notification. Setting thresholds for when alerts should notify teams can be challenging. Thresholds that are too tight will create alert fatigue while thresholds that are too loose will lead to unhappy customers. Baseline alerts allow you to set dynamic thresholds for alerts based on historical performance. Use baselines to tune your alert to the right threshold. For example, an alert in APM can notify incident response teams if web transaction times deviate from historical performance for an allotted amount of time. alerts.newrelic.com > (selected alert policy) > (selected alert condition) > Define thresholds You can set this same kind of alert in browser to catch sub-optimal performance. In the following example, we've set both a warning and a violation for throughput: alerts.newrelic.com > (selected alert policy) > (selected alert condition) > Define thresholds As you develop smaller, independent services running on increasingly ephemeral architectures, your environments become significantly more complex. Visibility into outliers can be an important tool for understanding likely performance issues. You should set alerts to automatically fire when you have an outlier, which can indicate misbehaving hosts, load balancers, or apps. For example, a load balancer divides web traffic across five different servers. You can set an alert based on a NRQL query and receive a notification if any server starts getting significantly more or less traffic than the other servers. Here is an example chart: And here's a sample NRQL query: SELECT average(cpuPercent) FROM SystemSample WHERE apmApplicationNames = 'MY-APP-NAME' FACET hostname Copy Now you have set static, baseline, and outlier alerts. This can provide a comprehensive awareness of your ecosystem. Refer to the New Relic Alerts documentation for more details about optimizing your alerts. 3. Identify groups Identify groups to alert, set broadcasting methods, and assign first responders to team dashboards Alerting without the proper broadcasting methods leaves you vulnerable. Your alerting strategy should include a notification channel to ensure the appropriate teams are notified if your application or architecture encounters issues. New Relic has many notification integrations, but we recommend that you start simple and add more complexity later. We recommend that you first send alerts to a group chat channel (for example, using Slack or PagerDuty). Evaluate these alerts in real time for several weeks to understand which alerts are indicative of important or problematic issues. These are the types of alerts that warrant waking someone up. Recommendation: For each team dashboard, make sure: It has an owner who assumes responsibility for the health of the applications and features it monitors. There is no ambiguity about who is responsible for attending to and resolving an alert condition. This policy will vary between organizations depending on size, structure, and culture. For example, some teams may prefer to assign dashboards and alerts based on de-facto features or application ownership. Other teams may prefer to adopt an on-call rotation (often referred to as pager duty). In on-call rotations, designated team members handle all first-line incident responses, and they resolve or delegate responsibilities based on predetermined incident thresholds. 4. Determine thresholds Determine incident thresholds for alert conditions For each of your applications: Identify the thresholds for what is officially considered an incident. Make sure each set of threshold criteria is context-dependent. Document incident evaluation and known remediation procedures in runbooks. Include links to your runbooks when you define conditions and thresholds for your alert policies. For instance, a certain alert condition may be dismissable during low-traffic periods but require active remediation during peak hours. 5. Set notification channels Ensure alerts have auditable notification channels Make sure that communications during critical incidents take place in easily accessible and highly visible channels. A group chat room dedicated to incident communication is usually a great choice. This allows all stakeholders to participate or observe and provides a chronology of notifications, key decisions, and actions for postmortem analysis. Use any of the available notification channels in New Relic Alerts. For example, to set up a notification channel in Slack: Make sure your organization has completed New Relic's integration requirements with Slack. In the Slack app, select the dropdown in the top-left corner of the app, and select Customize Slack. Click Configure apps. From the list of app integrations, select New Relic. Expand the instructions for New Relic Alerts, and follow the steps to configure notifications from New Relic. 6. Automate resolution Automate triage and resolution steps Automation of simple or repeatable incident response tasks will increase efficiency and minimize the impact of incidents. With proper automation in place, you can disable or isolate faulty application components as soon as an alert threshold is reached, rather than after a notification has been issued. For example, a team managing an application for a digital media company wants to be able to remove commenting abilities from the website if the system has errors. In this case, they could: Add an endpoint to their front-end web application that will toggle a feature flag enabling or disabling the UI components associated with posting comments on an article. Create an alert policy with a threshold set on the sustained error rate in the commenting service. Assign a webhook notification channel that will send a POST request to this endpoint, as well as to the standard team notification channels. In this scenario, errors in the commenting system will trigger the webhook and remove the commenting UI from the website. Users can still use core functionality of the site without seeing errors generated by the commenting service. The application will maintain a stable but degraded state, allowing the team to focus on recovery without the pressure of preventing users from accessing the site. You can also use webhooks to create issues and action items in ticketing systems that have REST APIs, such as Zendesk. Use New Relic Alerts to create a webhook notification channel, and customize the webhook payload as needed. New Relic also provides integrations for common ticketing systems. You can use any of these integrations to file tickets from APM. 7. Establish reviews Establish a post mortem process After the incident has been resolved, key stakeholders and participants must capture accurate and thorough documentation of the incident. At a minimum, we recommend that the retro documentation includes: A root cause analysis A chronology and summary of remediation steps and their result, whether they were successful or not A measure of the impact to the business in terms of user experience and financial losses, if possible Recommendations for system or feature improvements to prevent a recurrence Recommendations for process and communication improvements Store post mortem reports in a highly visible, searchable repository, such as a shared drive folder or wiki. Culturally, it's essential that this process focuses on constructive learning and improvement rather than punishment or blame. Example post mortem report Here is a brief example of a post mortem report: Post mortem Comments Date March 1, 2018 Executive summary From approximately 1:45PM until 2:30PM, users could not add items to their carts, which prevented any checkouts from occurring during the incident period. Root cause We determined that a change was made to the CSS rules on the product detail page that effectively disabled the Add to cart button. Timeline 1:50PM: Successful checkouts < 10 for 5 minutes alert triggered; assigned to Alice. 1:55PM: After reviewing the ecommerce team dashboard, Alice determined that the threshold was breached immediately following a deploy by Bob. She notified him of the incident. 2:00PM: Alice and Bob began troubleshooting. Attempts at recreating the issue in production were successful. 2:20PM: Bob determined that his change to the CSS on the product detail page disabled the Add to cart button. He deployed a hotfix. 2:30PM: Functionality was restored and the incident was resolved. Impact No checkouts were completed during the duration of the incident. Our typical revenue for a Thursday during this timeframe is $30,000. Recommendations We have been discussing implementing New Relic Synthetics for awhile now. If we had a Synthetic check on the checkout process, this issue would have been detected immediately. We should also implement more thorough unit tests in the front-end web app. 8. Fine-tune process Fine-tune alerts and thresholds As you use New Relic to optimize your application and infrastructure performance, tighten your New Relic Alerts policy conditions to keep pace with your improved performance. When rolling out new code or modifications that could negatively impact performance over a period of time, loosen your threshold conditions to allow for these short-term changes. For instance, we recommend using pre-established baselines and thresholds to increase efficiency during high-impact times for your business, such as annual events and major releases. Fine-tuning gives you the flexibility you need to increase efficiencies and extend your notification channels. As noted earlier, we recommend you start with a group chat service when you first establish notifications. Once you've identified other tools you'd like to integrate with, set up a notification channel to maintain your momentum. Tools such as xMatters and PagerDuty provide popular integrations, but don't overlook simple methods, such as webhooks. The goal is to continuously improve your alerting scheme. Be sure to check your alerts and confirm that they're firing regularly and are still relevant for your customer satisfaction metrics. Use the New Relic platform to create dashboards centered around alerts and incidents for the most common policy conditions and violations. insights.newrelic.com > All dashboards > (selected dashboard) Use the New Relic query language and the Insights query API to create your dashboards. The dashboard above was created using the following NRQL queries. It's recommended you recreate them as needed for your alerting dashboards. Incidents by condition: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state = 'open' FACET condition_name SINCE 1 week ago Copy Incidents by policy: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME where current_state = 'open' FACET policy_name SINCE 60 MINUTES AGO TIMESERIES Copy Alert trends over time: SELECT count(*) FROM ALERT_NAME WHERE current_state IS NOT NULL FACET policy_name SINCE 1 week ago TIMESERIES Copy Incident details: SELECT timestamp, incident_id, policy_name, condition_name, details, severity FROM ALERT_NAME SINCE 1 week ago LIMIT 40 Copy Visualizing this data provides a resource you can share with others to refine the alerts and thresholds you're using. Expert tip In addition to instrumenting and measuring application and infrastructure metrics, mature DevOps organizations often measure and optimize the efficiency of incident response processes. For example, you can use webhooks to send alert events to New Relic Insights. This allows you to supplement your team dashboards with New Relic Alerts data.",

      "body": "Whether you've recently completed your cloud migration, have been using cloud-based services for a while, or have always been in the cloud, you may find yourself deploying modern, cutting-edge technologies and services. It's important to develop the ability to adopt new services easily and with confidence; innovation never stops for companies operating in the cloud, and a company's willingness to embrace new technology can give it a major competitive differentiator. These modern technologies could be container solutions such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Amazon AWS ECS or Fargate, for example. Or they could be serverless services such as AWS Lambda, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform Functions. They may be cloud-based databases, or any number of cloud services that abstract the service away from an operations-maintained infrastructure. In these situations, you want to monitor, query, and alert on the performance and usage metrics for both modern technologies and cloud-based services. This allows your team to deploy faster, to adopt new services with confidence, to make better business decisions, and in general to expand its technology horizons. Here are the steps to using the New Relic Platform to monitor your modern technologies and cloud services: 1. Identify services and technologies Determine the components you need to monitor by answering the following questions: What cloud-based applications do I have? What are the underlying cloud-based services, technologies, and infrastructure supporting those applications? When you have a full understanding of your architecture, you reduce the possibility of missing dependencies and new services that might impact your organization's application environment. 2. Deploy New Relic Infrastructure After reviewing the requirements for New Relic Infrastructure, install the Infrastructure agent on the hosts you identified in Step One so that you can monitor your cloud services. If you use Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for automation, you can use those tools to deploy Infrastructure agents to your hosts. 3. Configure cloud integrations As you integrate new cloud services, you can use New Relic to monitor and report data about these services; giving you a single, comprehensive overview of your entire architecture. To configure cloud service integrations, link your Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service provider account with New Relic. 4. Track data on your dashboards New Relic Infrastructure integrations auto-populate dashboards with metrics from cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP so you can track the data that is critical to your cloud adoption success. Tip If you adopt a hybrid cloud of multiple cloud providers, New Relic can provide a holistic perspective that is agnostic to cloud providers. AWS EC2 monitoring integration dashboard In this default dashboard for the AWS EC2 monitoring integration, New Relic captures metrics for EC2 instances per region, instance state, and instance type. The dashboard also shows inventory for different software packages and configurations that are installed on those instances. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Integrations > Amazon Web Services: View AWS EC2 data on the default dashboard for the AWS EC2 monitoring integration. Azure VMs monitoring integration dashboard The default Azure virtual machine integration dashboard shows data for VM sizes, VMs per region, and VMs per resource group. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Integrations > Microsoft Azure: View Azure virtual machine data on the default dashboard for the Azure VMs monitoring integration. GCP Compute Engine monitoring integration dashboard In this default dashboard for the Google Cloud Platform, New Relic captures metrics for instances per zone, instance status, firewall dropped packets, reserved cores, and disk throttled operations. The dashboard also shows inventory for different software packages and configurations that are installed on those instances. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Integrations > Google Cloud Platform: View GCP Compute Engine data on the default dashboard for the GCP Compute Engine monitoring integration. Example modern and cloud services dashboard In this example dashboard, three different cloud vendors, modern technologies, cloud services, infrastructure instance locations, and DevOps widgets are combined for an overall view. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Here is an example of an Insights dashboard with data about vendors, technologies, services, instances, and other important details for DevOps teams. 5. Add alerts for cloud-based metrics When monitoring cloud-based services, it is essential to keep track of all changes to a system by alerting on them. Integrations with New Relic Infrastructure allow you to create alerts on the metrics that are the most important to you. Here is an example of a baseline alert that will notify you based on the number of requests received on all AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ALB) systems for the ALB monitoring integration: alerts.newrelic.com > Alert policies > (selected policy) > Alert conditions: Create a NRQL baseline alert to monitor the number of requests received your ALB systems. 6. Set up additional monitoring For full-stack visibility into every aspect of your app, we recommend deploying other types of New Relic monitoring: Use APM to report application-tier performance metrics. Use browser monitoring to report front-end web metrics. Use mobile monitoring to report front-end mobile app metrics. Use synthetic monitoring to monitor websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. 7. CI/CD pipeline integration It's important to track deployments and the impact that code and infrastructure changes have on your end-user experience. APM deployment markers allow you to record deployments for each application. A deployment marker is an event indicating that a deployment happened. You can pair markers with metadata from your source code management (SCM) system ( including user IDs, revisions, and change logs.). APM displays a vertical line, or marker, on charts and graphs at the deployment event's timestamp. When you hover over the line, APM displays the associated metadata for that deployment. Tracking deployments is an invaluable way to determine the root causes of immediate, long-term, or gradual degradations in your applications. Recommendation: Make POST requests to the New Relic REST API as the final step of a successful CI/CD deployment, as described in the API documentation. The following tools have integrations or plugins available to help automate CI/CD deployments: Chef (see newrelic_deployment) Jenkins Ansible Puppet 8. AWS Lambda Monitoring New Relic One features an updated APM agent that is highly optimized from a cost and time perspective for ephemeral Lambda functions. Enable New Relic monitoring of AWS Lambda to to assess invocations, error rate, function duration, cold starts, and more. You can also take advantage of New Relic's Infrastructure integration with Lambda for additional reporting capabilities.",

Capturing tangible, measurable metrics from before and after each change allows teams to optimize changes in isolation and reduce the impact to other work happening in the system. Prerequisite Before starting this tutorial, complete the Establish objectives and baselines. 1. Integrate measurements into your development process With appropriate measurements incorporated into all phases of your development cycle, you can surface errors and performance issues before your customers uncover them. As your application teams plan their work, use your KPI dashboards in daily stand-ups and other planning meetings to analyze necessary debugging work, assess whether recent deployments were successful, and prioritize other work efforts. When development and operations teams use dashboards during planning and discussions, they ensure that they're consistently incorporating feedback about customer experiences and reliability risks into their development efforts. For proper testing, ensure that instrumentation in your pre-production environments is in parity with your production environments. Use dashboards to compare the environments and verify that the code and infrastructure changes you make across them are correct, and eliminate any anomalies before pushing code to production. Beyond using instrumentation to measure software performance, also use it to analyze team efficiency. For example, with your alerts data, use NRQL and external integrations to calculate mean time to repair (MTTR) by subtracting the difference in event timestamps as the current state of each event changes from OPEN to ACKNOWLEDGED to CLOSED. Or push events into Insights from a source code management (SCM) system like GitHub, and calculate the amount of time it takes a code change to go live by comparing the timestamp of a commit event to that of a deploy event. Plotted over time, this could become a KPI in a DevOps transformation. 2. Add automated deployment markers It's important to track deployments and the impact code and infrastructure changes have on your end-user experience. Using deployment markers in APM, you can record deployments for each application. A deployment marker is an event indicating that a deployment happened, and it's paired with metadata available from your SCM system (for example, the user, revision, or change-log). APM displays a vertical line, or “marker,” on charts and graphs at the deployment event's timestamp. When you hover over the line, APM displays the associated metadata for that deployment. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Monitoring > Overview APM also provides a chronological list of deployments of your application. Additional metrics, such as error rate and Apdex from the time of the deployment, are available as well. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Deployments Tracking deployments is a valuable way to determine the root cause of immediate, long-term, or gradual degradations in your application. New Relic recommends that you make POST requests to the New Relic REST API as the final step of a successful CI/CD deployment as described in the API documentation. The following tools have integrations or plugins available to help automate this: Chef (see newrelic_deployment) Jenkins Ansible Puppet 3. Test your pipeline with Infrastructure An important part of optimizing your cloud native environment is a making a cultural shift toward smaller, more frequent changes to your code and infrastructure. After you complete the first two steps of this tutorial, begin to test and gather appropriate performance insights about your deployment pipeline to more clearly understand the impact of the changes you make. Code changes should be as small as possible in terms of the number of lines of code and source files you change. Changes should also involve as few team members as possible. This makes it much easier to identify issue owners and determine root causes if errors occur. Similarly, infrastructure changes should also have as small a footprint as possible to minimize the number of applications affected by each change. New Relic Infrastructure helps you see when an infrastructure change has caused a spike in issues, as shown in the following example: one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Hosts For cloud infrastructure changes or larger code changes, consider using a blue/green deployment strategy. APM supports multiple app names, which is a good fit for this model. To implement this strategy: Deploy a version of your application to existing infrastructure using a rollup app name that signifies it as the “blue” version (or control version). Deploy a new version of your application to a subset of the infrastructure (or an alternate set of infrastructure) with a rollup name that signifies this as the “green” version (or experimental version). Ensure that traffic is routed appropriately between both versions. Compare established KPI dashboards of both versions against one another. Optimize the new version accordingly to meet your KPI targets. When you're satisfied with the application's performance, deploy the new version across your infrastructure using the original app name, and consider this the new baseline for any future changes you'll make to the application.",

      "body": "Whether you've recently completed your cloud migration, have been using cloud-based services for a while, or have always been in the cloud, you may find yourself deploying modern, cutting-edge technologies and services. It's important to develop the ability to adopt new services easily and with confidence; innovation never stops for companies operating in the cloud, and a company's willingness to embrace new technology can give it a major competitive differentiator. These modern technologies could be container solutions such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Amazon AWS ECS or Fargate, for example. Or they could be serverless services such as AWS Lambda, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform Functions. They may be cloud-based databases, or any number of cloud services that abstract the service away from an operations-maintained infrastructure. In these situations, you want to monitor, query, and alert on the performance and usage metrics for both modern technologies and cloud-based services. This allows your team to deploy faster, to adopt new services with confidence, to make better business decisions, and in general to expand its technology horizons. Here are the steps to using the New Relic Platform to monitor your modern technologies and cloud services: 1. Identify services and technologies Determine the components you need to monitor by answering the following questions: What cloud-based applications do I have? What are the underlying cloud-based services, technologies, and infrastructure supporting those applications? When you have a full understanding of your architecture, you reduce the possibility of missing dependencies and new services that might impact your organization's application environment. 2. Deploy New Relic Infrastructure After reviewing the requirements for New Relic Infrastructure, install the Infrastructure agent on the hosts you identified in Step One so that you can monitor your cloud services. If you use Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for automation, you can use those tools to deploy Infrastructure agents to your hosts. 3. Configure cloud integrations As you integrate new cloud services, you can use New Relic to monitor and report data about these services; giving you a single, comprehensive overview of your entire architecture. To configure cloud service integrations, link your Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service provider account with New Relic. 4. Track data on your dashboards New Relic Infrastructure integrations auto-populate dashboards with metrics from cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP so you can track the data that is critical to your cloud adoption success. Tip If you adopt a hybrid cloud of multiple cloud providers, New Relic can provide a holistic perspective that is agnostic to cloud providers. AWS EC2 monitoring integration dashboard In this default dashboard for the AWS EC2 monitoring integration, New Relic captures metrics for EC2 instances per region, instance state, and instance type. The dashboard also shows inventory for different software packages and configurations that are installed on those instances. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Integrations > Amazon Web Services: View AWS EC2 data on the default dashboard for the AWS EC2 monitoring integration. Azure VMs monitoring integration dashboard The default Azure virtual machine integration dashboard shows data for VM sizes, VMs per region, and VMs per resource group. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Integrations > Microsoft Azure: View Azure virtual machine data on the default dashboard for the Azure VMs monitoring integration. GCP Compute Engine monitoring integration dashboard In this default dashboard for the Google Cloud Platform, New Relic captures metrics for instances per zone, instance status, firewall dropped packets, reserved cores, and disk throttled operations. The dashboard also shows inventory for different software packages and configurations that are installed on those instances. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Integrations > Google Cloud Platform: View GCP Compute Engine data on the default dashboard for the GCP Compute Engine monitoring integration. Example modern and cloud services dashboard In this example dashboard, three different cloud vendors, modern technologies, cloud services, infrastructure instance locations, and DevOps widgets are combined for an overall view. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Here is an example of an Insights dashboard with data about vendors, technologies, services, instances, and other important details for DevOps teams. 5. Add alerts for cloud-based metrics When monitoring cloud-based services, it is essential to keep track of all changes to a system by alerting on them. Integrations with New Relic Infrastructure allow you to create alerts on the metrics that are the most important to you. Here is an example of a baseline alert that will notify you based on the number of requests received on all AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ALB) systems for the ALB monitoring integration: alerts.newrelic.com > Alert policies > (selected policy) > Alert conditions: Create a NRQL baseline alert to monitor the number of requests received your ALB systems. 6. Set up additional monitoring For full-stack visibility into every aspect of your app, we recommend deploying other types of New Relic monitoring: Use APM to report application-tier performance metrics. Use browser monitoring to report front-end web metrics. Use mobile monitoring to report front-end mobile app metrics. Use synthetic monitoring to monitor websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. 7. CI/CD pipeline integration It's important to track deployments and the impact that code and infrastructure changes have on your end-user experience. APM deployment markers allow you to record deployments for each application. A deployment marker is an event indicating that a deployment happened. You can pair markers with metadata from your source code management (SCM) system ( including user IDs, revisions, and change logs.). APM displays a vertical line, or marker, on charts and graphs at the deployment event's timestamp. When you hover over the line, APM displays the associated metadata for that deployment. Tracking deployments is an invaluable way to determine the root causes of immediate, long-term, or gradual degradations in your applications. Recommendation: Make POST requests to the New Relic REST API as the final step of a successful CI/CD deployment, as described in the API documentation. The following tools have integrations or plugins available to help automate CI/CD deployments: Chef (see newrelic_deployment) Jenkins Ansible Puppet 8. AWS Lambda Monitoring New Relic One features an updated APM agent that is highly optimized from a cost and time perspective for ephemeral Lambda functions. Enable New Relic monitoring of AWS Lambda to to assess invocations, error rate, function duration, cold starts, and more. You can also take advantage of New Relic's Infrastructure integration with Lambda for additional reporting capabilities.",

      "body": "In the cloud, it's important to look regularly and closely at how your applications and services are architected and utilized. It's the best way to identify opportunities that will let you right-size your instances, fine tune your databases, modify your storage usage, better configure your load balancers, or even re-architect your applications. For example, if you have a set of 20 instances all running at 10% CPU usage, you might consider using smaller instances or consolidating more work onto those instances. This kind of thinking about your cloud utilization and spend will help you optimize your environment and save money quickly. Optimizing your cloud architecture has three main goals: Improve performance, availability, and end-user experience by taking better advantage of cloud services Optimize your cloud spend, striking the delicate balance between cost and performance Capture business and technical metrics that help justify your current cloud spend that can be referenced as justification for a larger cloud budget as growth dictates In this tutorial, we'll show you how to use the New Relic platform to capture all the data you should leverage to optimize your cloud architecture and spend. 1. Instrument your application and cloud environment Make sure the following products and integrations are instrumented: Instrument Details Install Infrastructure Instrument infrastructure: If you haven't already done so, review the requirements for the Infrastructure agent. Infrastructure comes with several types of integrations, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and on-host integrations. After you've installed the Infrastructure agent on your host(s), you'll immediately have access to the broad spectrum of metrics the agent collects out-of-the-box. Install the APM agent Instrument your applications with APM. Doing so will let you monitor how your applications are performing while you are optimizing the underlying cloud services. That way, you can confirm that your changes to the infrastructure are in fact improving application performance. Configure the AWS integration New Relic Infrastructure's Amazon integrations let you monitor your AWS data in several New Relic products, including Infrastructure, dashboards, and New Relic Alerts. Connect AWS Billing If you are hosted in an AWS environment, New Relic can help you monitor your cloud spend with our AWS Billing integration. To leverage New Relic's AWS Billing integration, follow the procedures in the Connect AWS Billing documentation 2. Create dashboards to display baseline infrastructure metrics; include AWS budgets if available Dashboards lets you write powerful custom queries about your data and visualize the results in widgets displayed on a common dashboard. You can also feed the results of your queries directly into New Relic Alerts, where you can get immediate notifications on any deviation identified. For this step, you should display baseline infrastructure metrics related to performance and usage (CPU, memory, disk, database, etc.). Include AWS Budgets if available. To get you started, here are ways to use Insights dashboards to visualize your AWS cloud utilization and spend data: This dashboard shows data broken out by the applications and budgets you set up in the AWS budgeting area. Create individual dashboards for each application, and then collect those dashboards into a single “data app,” as shown here. This AWS Production Overview data app displays a set of widgets relevant to an AWS production budget. Data apps are great for presentations where you want to step through a series of topics and also provide a clear overview of an entire environment or service. Create dashboards for each level of your organization Whether you're a developer, operator, or executive, having information about your cloud utilization can help you optimize your cloud environment: Developers: Understanding what applications currently cost can help developers configure applications to use more services more efficiently. For example, could developers cut cloud costs using AWS Lambda or properly sized instances? Operators: Monitoring application utilization allows operators to catch possible overruns due to mis-configured services. For example, is the ops team's auto-scaling configuration scaling down properly? Executives: An overall view of both fore-casted and actual cloud spend, for individual applications, per region, and overall totals, can help executives make better business decisions. Use New Relic to keep track of your cloud spend, and make sure your teams get alerted immediately when you exceed thresholds. 3. Identify resources for optimization This step shows you how to use the metrics New Relic has captured to determine which resources to optimize. In the sample dashboard above, the CPU-usage widget on the left reveals that this application uses many instances sizes. Note that the “c4.xlarge” instance (in coral) consistently consumes only around 20% CPU capacity. However, when you analyze the c4.xlarge Memory usage in the center widget (light green), you'll see that memory usage for this instance ranges from 20% to 80%. This suggests that the application is more memory-intensive than CPU-intensive. In this case, the instance type should be changed from a compute-optimized instance to one that is memory-optimized. (Note: the chart on the right of the dashboard can be used to monitor the application's average response time as you make these optimizations.) This is just one example of how to identify cloud-based resources that could be candidates for optimization. Now that you've identified architecture for optimization, go ahead and do so. Whether you right-size your instances, fine tune your databases, modify your storage usage, better configure your load balancers, or even re-architect your applications, in the end your goal is to be able to compare your new, optimized architecture against the baselines you captured in Step 2. For more about baselines please review the Establish Objectives & Baselines tutorial. 4. Optional: Set up alerts You can create an alert condition for NRQL queries. Be sure to reference the complete documentation as needed. In the data app for the AWS production budget introduced in Step 2, this was one of the widgets: Here is the query that we used to create that widget: SELECT latest(`provider.actualAmount`) as '$ Actual', latest(`provider.forecastedAmount`) as '$ Forecast', max(`provider.limitAmount`) as '$ Limit' FROM FinanceSample WHERE provider = 'BillingBudget' AND `provider.budgetName` = '[Your Cloud Budget]' Copy If you can write queries on your data and show them in Insights, then you can easily use them to generate Alert conditions. Baseline queries New Relic also lets you write “baseline queries” against your data. These are queriesy you write without setting hard limits on the results. Rather, you let New Relic Applied Intelligence “machine-learn” your performance data, and then alert you when your data strays too far outside of your baseline numbers. To create a baseline query, head over the the Alert console, go into Alert policies, and add a New alert policy. Then follow these steps: Create alert policy. Give your policy a concise and descriptive name and select an Incident Preference. Then select Create alert policy. Create a condition. Select NRQL Define your query, and decide how restrictively Applied Intelligence should analyze your data using a simple slider and visualization based on your recent performance. The slider at the bottom of the chart either increases or decreases the gray band around your budget threshold (the blue line). The setting shown would have resulted in zero violations based on recent data, and that is what you're looking for. However, if that blue line spikes up or down out of the gray band, New Relic will immediately notify you. Using New Relic Applied Intelligence is a great way to help you proactively learn about your cloud spending or about any of your performance data.

      "body": "As you migrate your applications to the cloud, you want to catch and correct any unexpected behavior or outcomes as soon as possible. Detecting errors and issues related to your new cloud architecture, performance, and scale is critical—getting the right information at the right time can be the difference between success and failure. 1. Identify components Create a list all of applications, services, and their underlying server infrastructures in your application portfolio that you want to migrate to the cloud. 2. Identify KPIs To provide quantifiable measures that your teams can use to assess your migration, identify a list of corporate KPIs (key performance indicators). Using the New Relic platform to measure KPIs helps you eliminate blindspots and see the connections between entities—from your application code, to your cloud infrastructure (including containers running in highly distributed microservices), to your customer experience. Your goal is to create a collection of metrics in several categories that you can visualize in our Dashboards. To validate cloud improvements, group KPIs in the following categories, from least to most strong: Application and infrastructure performance End-user experience, including website and mobile application performance Audience and content trends DevOps productivity Application revenue analytics Future business goals 3. Deploy monitoring tools To start monitoring your KPIs, verify that the applications that you want to migrate are compatible with the requirements for the New Relic products you will use. Then, install the New Relic agents: Deploy APM Review the compatibility and requirements and then install APM agents on your application stack. After installing the APM agents, review the architecture of the applications that you instrumented with an APM agent. Take note of all hosts that are part of each tier of the application stack (database, application, web server, etc.), so you can install infrastructure monitoring agents on each of those hosts. Deploy browser monitoring In a nutshell, browser monitoring is a snippet of JavaScript that needs to appear in all of your application's webpages. It has no dependencies on other libraries, so it does not cause additional delays when bringing jQuery or other frameworks into the webpage. There are three ways to install the browser agent: Method When to use this method Enable via APM Typically, the quickest path is to let the APM agent dynamically inject the snippet into your pages on the server side. This works for many common web technologies, such as .NET, JSP, and other Java solutions. The documentation provides a complete reference for the languages and frameworks that allow this option. Copy/paste method If you are using an unsupported framework or are in an environment where you can instrument only the webpages but cannot install APM on the backend, use the copy-paste method. The UI generates a simple JavaScript snippet. Copy that snippet, and paste it into a global page template on your end to get browser monitoring deployed across your site. Enable via the API You can perform a manual instrumentation, in which your developers add instrumentation to your webpages using a server-side API. New Relic supports this for many server-side languages. Refer to the documentation for an example of how to do this in Java. Deploy New Relic Infrastructure After reviewing the requirements for New Relic Infrastructure, install the Infrastructure agent on the hosts that you identified so you can start to gather data for your KPIs. Tip If you use Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for automation, you can use those tools to deploy Infrastructure agents to your hosts. Set up alerts New Relic Alerts is a single integrated solution with a centralized UI to help you focus on the metrics that you care about most. When you set up New Relic Alerts and NRQL alerting, you establish flexible policies and conditions to receive alerts and notifications on multiple channels (email, Slack, OpsGenie, etc.). For more detailed information about creating, managing, and using alerts, check out the New Relic University tutorials. 4. Set up cloud integrations Tip Cloud-based integrations available through New Relic include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. Once your applications are migrated to the cloud and you start to integrate new cloud services, you can use New Relic to monitor and report data about your cloud services, offering you a comprehensive view of your entire architecture in one place. For example, to capture and record AWS account activity for audit and governance purposes, use the New Relic AWS CloudTrail integration. Tracking error events gives you awareness about API calls and services that have failed, while console logins help you monitor console activity and potential intrusion attempts. New Relic collects this event data so you can display it in a Dashboard or alert on it with NRQL. To gain extended visibility into applications that your code depends on, you can also deploy on-host integrations for commonly used application components, such as MySQL, Apache, and NGINX. In addition, you can create your own custom on-host integration with the New Relic Integrations SDK. 5. Identify issues and roadblocks Once your applications are running in the cloud, they may generate new types of errors that are different from the errors that they generated when running on-premise. You can use New Relic APM and browser monitoring to view error events, error metrics, and detailed error traces for your applications. If an error or unhandled exception happens, the data appears on the JavaScript errors page and the APM Error analytics page. From these pages, you can quickly troubleshoot runtime errors. Then, further analyze errors by grouping them according to attributes, by filtering them, or by searching for keywords in the event data. Each unhandled exception generates a transaction error event in Insights, and the dashboards are updated in real-time. Event data is a record of a single event at a particular moment in time and consists of default attributes, like a timestamp, and an event type. You can also add custom attributes to provide more context. Tip Once you start capturing JavaScript errors as events in Insights, set up NRQL alerting so you can stay on top of your error data. Use the JavaScript errors page to get visibility into real-time user experience: one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors: Use the charts on this page to get visibility into the real-time user experience. Then, create a Dashboard that covers a longer period of time and aligns the error and unhandled exception data with your KPIs: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > Create a dashboard: Use dashboards to align the error and unhandled exception data with your KPIs. Expert tip for alerting on JavaScript errors To get notifications for error spikes that are different from known or common JavaScript errors, use the following NRQL query for browser-monitored: SELECT count(*) FROM JavaScriptError WHERE appName = '<BrowserAppName>' AND errorClass NOT IN ('<ErrorClass1>','<ErrorClass2>') Copy Replace <BrowserAppName> with the browser app name that you want to monitor with this alert. Replace <ErrorClass1> and <ErrorClass2> with the on-premise error class names that you do not want New Relic to alert you about. Set the threshold based on your alerting needs. Using this query, New Relic alerts you every time a JavaScript error occurs when it has an error class that is not normally reported.",

      "body": "When you are planning a migration to the cloud, it is important to analyze your current on-premise architecture and identify the scope of your migration. When you have a full understanding of your applications, your hosts, and their architecture, you reduce the possibility of missing dependencies during your migration. 1. Identify applications and components First, you need to determine the level of instrumentation that is possible or allowed within your organization. The deeper you instrument, the more visibility you gain into your applications. Then, address the scope of your cloud migration by answering the following questions and keeping track of your answers: What applications do I need to include in the migration? What are the dependencies of each application? What are the underlying services/inventory supporting these applications? 2. Install New Relic agents Based on your answers when you determined the scope of your cloud migration, verify that the applications that you want to migrate are compatible with New Relic products and install the agents: APM APM delivers data about your application's performance, providing information about app availability and external services so you can visualize your application dependencies. Confirm that your system meets the requirements for the APM agents that you want to install, and then install the APM agent on your application stack. Steps for installing APM agents vary based on language. Infrastructure Infrastructure monitoring provides flexible, dynamic server monitoring so you can inventory your hosts and their configuration settings. Confirm that your underlying infrastructure meets the requirements for infrastructure. Install the infrastructure agent on instances that host your applications. Infrastructure on-host integrations Infrastructure on-host integrations monitor the services that your code depends on. Install the on-host integrations for the services that you are using. 3. Visualize application dependencies with APM After you install the APM agent, use service maps to get a full view of your application’s architecture. Service maps allow you to identify any connections from applications to external services, web services, databases, or APIs. After creating a service map for the application that has dependencies that you want to explore, add an application node on the map. Then, begin to add connections to the map including databases, external services, third-party APIs, and even browser-monitored applications. New Relic pulls every node you add into the map, and you can watch the shape of your architecture emerge. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Service map: View a service map to see a visual overview of your system architecture and the health of entities. Based on the visibility into internal and external dependencies that the service map provides, you can create a migration plan that includes all aspects of an application’s ecosystem. 4. Inventory underlining instances with Infrastructure New Relic Infrastructure's inventory page gives you visibility into the software packages installed on your servers. Essentially, the inventory page displays detailed information about a system’s per-host configuration, including details about system modules, configuration files, metadata, packages, services, and user sessions. The inventory page provides a real-time, filterable, searchable view into each host’s configuration. The inventory page not only provides you with the list of packages installed but also provides version information as well. Use this version information to know which packages to upgrade and which packages to replicate for your cloud migration. It also helps you track the dependencies between the software packages and configuration files. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Inventory: View the inventory page for details about your hosts and their configurations. You can also use the Inventory page to get a sense of what software or packages you no longer need, which is a great way to “clean up” your servers before you migrate to the cloud. 5. Uncover unknown applications and components Since anything can happen during an application’s lifecycle, like an application changing ownership, you may come across applications or component dependencies that you did not know about. If you discover any unknown dependencies, assess their relationship to other applications and components in your infrastructure to determine if they should be pulled into your migration plan. If you discover any applications or components while viewing service maps or while reviewing the inventory page, remember to instrument them before you migrate them. 6. Resolve errors or other issues After you instrument your applications, APM may uncover errors or issues with your current on-prem applications. Use APM error analytics to determine the root cause of any errors or issues in your applications. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors: Use error analytics to determine the root cause of errors in your applications. Start with the Error rate chart to see if there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or error patterns. Correlate any patterns on the Top 5 errors chart to alerts occurring during the same time period. The Error traces table includes specific stack trace details, such as associated host, user, framework code, and custom attributes to help you identify the root cause of an error. 7. Create Dashboards In addition to the application baselines you built, create dashboards to assess your on-premises applications in preparation for migrating them to the cloud. Use Dashboards to gain visibility into the average response times, the top transactions, the associated average duration, and the overall CPU usage for your instrumented application. Drill down into individual applications to see your top processes and the CPU percent for each process. You can also view an error analysis for a set of instrumented applications: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > (select a dashboard): View errors visualize issues with your applications. Check out the best practices guide for tips on creating and utilizing dashboards. Sharing New Relic Dashboards with your teams and stakeholders is a powerful way to communicate the impact of your migration during your cloud adoption process.

New Relic offers cloud integrations for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform as well as on-host integrations. Tip If you are using AWS as a cloud provider, take advantage of New Relic’s AWS billing integrations to stay on top of your budget and prove the success of your migration. 3. Gather custom data To manage, search for, and filter resources, assign metadata to your cloud resources in the form of tags. Tags are labels that consist of key-value pairs that you use to annotate your Infrastructure data. Tag formats are different between AWS, Azure, and Google. Google, for example, has the shortest allowable lengths for keys and values. In addition, they all have different requirements for case sensitivity and allowable characters. To make sure that your tags are usable across most cloud providers: Use only lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes. Keep keys and values under 63 characters. New Relic reports data contained in specific events to your account as part of its “out-of-the-box” functionality. You can add additional data to those events by using custom attributes. If you determine that you need to collect custom data, review custom data requirements, and report custom event data. For more detailed information about sending custom data, check out these New Relic University tutorials: APM custom data overview Adding custom events using the API 4. Create baselines In order to validate the value of moving to the cloud, you need to get baselines for your applications before you move to the cloud. Define pre-migration baselines for applications and their underlying infrastructures that you have designated for cloud service improvements based on your KPIs. To stay on top of your KPIs as you are moving, create baseline alerts for applications monitored by APM and browser and use NRQL alerts to get notified on any spikes or drops in your KPIs. The following dashboard tracks key performance indicators for applications designated to move to the cloud: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > Create a dashboard: Create dashboards to track your KPIs. After you migrate applications to the cloud, apply the same criteria to post-migration baselines so you can compare your results from before and after your migration. 5. Validate improvements with Dashboards Dashboards is a single location to view all the data that New Relic products gather. Use New Relic Dashboards to visualize your KPIs before and after your move: Transaction and TransactionError event types with APM PageView and PageAction event types with browser Default Infrastructure events and attributes for your systems, processes, events, storage, and network, Infrastructure integrations, and custom attributes Mobile event types with Mobile SyntheticCheck, SyntheticRequest, and SyntheticPrivateMinion event types with Synthetics The following dashboard shows KPI data used to validate cloud improvements: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > Create a dashboard: Create dashboards to track your KPIs pre- and post-migration.

Identify KPIs To provide quantifiable measures that your teams can use to assess your migration, identify a list of corporate KPIs (key performance indicators). Using the New Relic platform to measure KPIs helps you eliminate blindspots and see the connections between entities—from your application code, to your cloud infrastructure (including containers running in highly distributed microservices), to your customer experience. Your goal is to create a collection of metrics in several categories that you can visualize in our Dashboards. To validate cloud improvements, group KPIs in the following categories, from least to most strong: Application and infrastructure performance End-user experience, including website and mobile application performance Audience and content trends DevOps productivity Application revenue analytics Future business goals 3. Deploy monitoring tools To start monitoring your KPIs, verify that the applications that you want to migrate are compatible with the requirements for the New Relic products you will use. Then, install the New Relic agents: Deploy APM Review the compatibility and requirements and then install APM agents on your application stack. After installing the APM agents, review the architecture of the applications that you instrumented with an APM agent. Take note of all hosts that are part of each tier of the application stack (database, application, web server, etc.), so you can install infrastructure monitoring agents on each of those hosts. Deploy browser monitoring In a nutshell, browser monitoring is a snippet of JavaScript that needs to appear in all of your application's webpages. It has no dependencies on other libraries, so it does not cause additional delays when bringing jQuery or other frameworks into the webpage. There are three ways to install the browser agent: Method When to use this method Enable via APM Typically, the quickest path is to let the APM agent dynamically inject the snippet into your pages on the server side. This works for many common web technologies, such as .NET, JSP, and other Java solutions. The documentation provides a complete reference for the languages and frameworks that allow this option. Copy/paste method If you are using an unsupported framework or are in an environment where you can instrument only the webpages but cannot install APM on the backend, use the copy-paste method. The UI generates a simple JavaScript snippet. Copy that snippet, and paste it into a global page template on your end to get browser monitoring deployed across your site. Enable via the API You can perform a manual instrumentation, in which your developers add instrumentation to your webpages using a server-side API. New Relic supports this for many server-side languages. Refer to the documentation for an example of how to do this in Java. Deploy New Relic Infrastructure After reviewing the requirements for New Relic Infrastructure, install the Infrastructure agent on the hosts that you identified so you can start to gather data for your KPIs. Tip If you use Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for automation, you can use those tools to deploy Infrastructure agents to your hosts. Set up alerts New Relic Alerts is a single integrated solution with a centralized UI to help you focus on the metrics that you care about most. When you set up New Relic Alerts and NRQL alerting, you establish flexible policies and conditions to receive alerts and notifications on multiple channels (email, Slack, OpsGenie, etc.). For more detailed information about creating, managing, and using alerts, check out the New Relic University tutorials. 4. Set up cloud integrations Tip Cloud-based integrations available through New Relic include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. Once your applications are migrated to the cloud and you start to integrate new cloud services, you can use New Relic to monitor and report data about your cloud services, offering you a comprehensive view of your entire architecture in one place. For example, to capture and record AWS account activity for audit and governance purposes, use the New Relic AWS CloudTrail integration. Tracking error events gives you awareness about API calls and services that have failed, while console logins help you monitor console activity and potential intrusion attempts. New Relic collects this event data so you can display it in a Dashboard or alert on it with NRQL. To gain extended visibility into applications that your code depends on, you can also deploy on-host integrations for commonly used application components, such as MySQL, Apache, and NGINX. In addition, you can create your own custom on-host integration with the New Relic Integrations SDK. 5. Identify issues and roadblocks Once your applications are running in the cloud, they may generate new types of errors that are different from the errors that they generated when running on-premise. You can use New Relic APM and browser monitoring to view error events, error metrics, and detailed error traces for your applications. If an error or unhandled exception happens, the data appears on the JavaScript errors page and the APM Error analytics page. From these pages, you can quickly troubleshoot runtime errors. Then, further analyze errors by grouping them according to attributes, by filtering them, or by searching for keywords in the event data. Each unhandled exception generates a transaction error event in Insights, and the dashboards are updated in real-time. Event data is a record of a single event at a particular moment in time and consists of default attributes, like a timestamp, and an event type. You can also add custom attributes to provide more context. Tip Once you start capturing JavaScript errors as events in Insights, set up NRQL alerting so you can stay on top of your error data. Use the JavaScript errors page to get visibility into real-time user experience: one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors: Use the charts on this page to get visibility into the real-time user experience. Then, create a Dashboard that covers a longer period of time and aligns the error and unhandled exception data with your KPIs: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > Create a dashboard: Use dashboards to align the error and unhandled exception data with your KPIs. Expert tip for alerting on JavaScript errors To get notifications for error spikes that are different from known or common JavaScript errors, use the following NRQL query for browser-monitored: SELECT count(*) FROM JavaScriptError WHERE appName = '<BrowserAppName>' AND errorClass NOT IN ('<ErrorClass1>','<ErrorClass2>') Copy Replace <BrowserAppName> with the browser app name that you want to monitor with this alert. Replace <ErrorClass1> and <ErrorClass2> with the on-premise error class names that you do not want New Relic to alert you about. Set the threshold based on your alerting needs. Using this query, New Relic alerts you every time a JavaScript error occurs when it has an error class that is not normally reported.",

      "body": "When you are planning a migration to the cloud, it is important to analyze your current on-premise architecture and identify the scope of your migration. When you have a full understanding of your applications, your hosts, and their architecture, you reduce the possibility of missing dependencies during your migration. 1. Identify applications and components First, you need to determine the level of instrumentation that is possible or allowed within your organization. The deeper you instrument, the more visibility you gain into your applications. Then, address the scope of your cloud migration by answering the following questions and keeping track of your answers: What applications do I need to include in the migration? What are the dependencies of each application? What are the underlying services/inventory supporting these applications? 2. Install New Relic agents Based on your answers when you determined the scope of your cloud migration, verify that the applications that you want to migrate are compatible with New Relic products and install the agents: APM APM delivers data about your application's performance, providing information about app availability and external services so you can visualize your application dependencies. Confirm that your system meets the requirements for the APM agents that you want to install, and then install the APM agent on your application stack. Steps for installing APM agents vary based on language. Infrastructure Infrastructure monitoring provides flexible, dynamic server monitoring so you can inventory your hosts and their configuration settings. Confirm that your underlying infrastructure meets the requirements for infrastructure. Install the infrastructure agent on instances that host your applications. Infrastructure on-host integrations Infrastructure on-host integrations monitor the services that your code depends on. Install the on-host integrations for the services that you are using. 3. Visualize application dependencies with APM After you install the APM agent, use service maps to get a full view of your application’s architecture. Service maps allow you to identify any connections from applications to external services, web services, databases, or APIs. After creating a service map for the application that has dependencies that you want to explore, add an application node on the map. Then, begin to add connections to the map including databases, external services, third-party APIs, and even browser-monitored applications. New Relic pulls every node you add into the map, and you can watch the shape of your architecture emerge. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Service map: View a service map to see a visual overview of your system architecture and the health of entities. Based on the visibility into internal and external dependencies that the service map provides, you can create a migration plan that includes all aspects of an application’s ecosystem. 4. Inventory underlining instances with Infrastructure New Relic Infrastructure's inventory page gives you visibility into the software packages installed on your servers. Essentially, the inventory page displays detailed information about a system’s per-host configuration, including details about system modules, configuration files, metadata, packages, services, and user sessions. The inventory page provides a real-time, filterable, searchable view into each host’s configuration. The inventory page not only provides you with the list of packages installed but also provides version information as well. Use this version information to know which packages to upgrade and which packages to replicate for your cloud migration. It also helps you track the dependencies between the software packages and configuration files. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Inventory: View the inventory page for details about your hosts and their configurations. You can also use the Inventory page to get a sense of what software or packages you no longer need, which is a great way to “clean up” your servers before you migrate to the cloud. 5. Uncover unknown applications and components Since anything can happen during an application’s lifecycle, like an application changing ownership, you may come across applications or component dependencies that you did not know about. If you discover any unknown dependencies, assess their relationship to other applications and components in your infrastructure to determine if they should be pulled into your migration plan. If you discover any applications or components while viewing service maps or while reviewing the inventory page, remember to instrument them before you migrate them. 6. Resolve errors or other issues After you instrument your applications, APM may uncover errors or issues with your current on-prem applications. Use APM error analytics to determine the root cause of any errors or issues in your applications. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors: Use error analytics to determine the root cause of errors in your applications. Start with the Error rate chart to see if there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or error patterns. Correlate any patterns on the Top 5 errors chart to alerts occurring during the same time period. The Error traces table includes specific stack trace details, such as associated host, user, framework code, and custom attributes to help you identify the root cause of an error. 7. Create Dashboards In addition to the application baselines you built, create dashboards to assess your on-premises applications in preparation for migrating them to the cloud. Use Dashboards to gain visibility into the average response times, the top transactions, the associated average duration, and the overall CPU usage for your instrumented application. Drill down into individual applications to see your top processes and the CPU percent for each process. You can also view an error analysis for a set of instrumented applications: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > (select a dashboard): View errors visualize issues with your applications. Check out the best practices guide for tips on creating and utilizing dashboards. Sharing New Relic Dashboards with your teams and stakeholders is a powerful way to communicate the impact of your migration during your cloud adoption process. Expert tip for reporting custom data Utilizing service maps, errors, and inventory management gives you a critical look at the architecture of your applications and their dependencies.

New Relic offers cloud integrations for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform as well as on-host integrations. Tip If you are using AWS as a cloud provider, take advantage of New Relic’s AWS billing integrations to stay on top of your budget and prove the success of your migration. 3. Gather custom data To manage, search for, and filter resources, assign metadata to your cloud resources in the form of tags. Tags are labels that consist of key-value pairs that you use to annotate your Infrastructure data. Tag formats are different between AWS, Azure, and Google. Google, for example, has the shortest allowable lengths for keys and values. In addition, they all have different requirements for case sensitivity and allowable characters. To make sure that your tags are usable across most cloud providers: Use only lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes. Keep keys and values under 63 characters. New Relic reports data contained in specific events to your account as part of its “out-of-the-box” functionality. You can add additional data to those events by using custom attributes. If you determine that you need to collect custom data, review custom data requirements, and report custom event data. For more detailed information about sending custom data, check out these New Relic University tutorials: APM custom data overview Adding custom events using the API 4. Create baselines In order to validate the value of moving to the cloud, you need to get baselines for your applications before you move to the cloud. Define pre-migration baselines for applications and their underlying infrastructures that you have designated for cloud service improvements based on your KPIs. To stay on top of your KPIs as you are moving, create baseline alerts for applications monitored by APM and browser and use NRQL alerts to get notified on any spikes or drops in your KPIs. The following dashboard tracks key performance indicators for applications designated to move to the cloud: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > Create a dashboard: Create dashboards to track your KPIs. After you migrate applications to the cloud, apply the same criteria to post-migration baselines so you can compare your results from before and after your migration. 5. Validate improvements with Dashboards Dashboards is a single location to view all the data that New Relic products gather. Use New Relic Dashboards to visualize your KPIs before and after your move: Transaction and TransactionError event types with APM PageView and PageAction event types with browser Default Infrastructure events and attributes for your systems, processes, events, storage, and network, Infrastructure integrations, and custom attributes Mobile event types with Mobile SyntheticCheck, SyntheticRequest, and SyntheticPrivateMinion event types with Synthetics The following dashboard shows KPI data used to validate cloud improvements: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > Create a dashboard: Create dashboards to track your KPIs pre- and post-migration.

      "body": "After you migrate your applications to the cloud and integrate cloud services, use New Relic to measure and validate improvements to your applications. 1. Identify KPIs To provide quantifiable measures that your teams can use to assess your migration, identify a list of corporate KPIs (key performance indicators). Using the New Relic platform to measure KPIs helps you eliminate blind spots and see the connections between entities—from your application code to your cloud infrastructure (including containers running in highly distributed microservices), to your customer experience. Your goal is to create a collection of metrics in several categories that you can visualize in dashboards in New Relic Dashboards. To validate cloud improvements, group KPIs in the following categories, from least to most strong: Application and infrastructure performance End-user experience, including website and mobile application performance Audience and content trends DevOps productivity Application revenue analytics Future business goals 2. Deploy monitoring tools To start monitoring your KPIs, verify that the applications that you want to migrate are compatible with the requirements for the New Relic products you want to use. Then, install the New Relic agents: Install APM Review the compatibility and requirements and then install APM agents on your application stack. After installing the APM agents, review the architecture of the applications you instrumented with an APM agent. Take note of all hosts that are part of each tier of the application stack (database, application, web server, etc.), so you can install New Relic Infrastructure agents on each of those hosts. Install infrastructure After reviewing the requirements for New Relic Infrastructure, install the infrastructure agent on the hosts that you identified so you can start to gather data for your KPIs. Tip If you use Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for automation, you can use those tools to deploy Infrastructure agents to your hosts. Install infrastructure integrations You can also monitor and report data about services that your code depends on using New Relic integrations. New Relic offers cloud integrations for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform as well as on-host integrations. Tip If you are using AWS as a cloud provider, take advantage of New Relic’s AWS billing integrations to stay on top of your budget and prove the success of your migration. 3. Gather custom data To manage, search for, and filter resources, assign metadata to your cloud resources in the form of tags. Tags are labels that consist of key-value pairs that you use to annotate your Infrastructure data. Tag formats are different between AWS, Azure, and Google. Google, for example, has the shortest allowable lengths for keys and values. In addition, they all have different requirements for case sensitivity and allowable characters. To make sure that your tags are usable across most cloud providers: Use only lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes. Keep keys and values under 63 characters. New Relic reports data contained in specific events to your account as part of its “out-of-the-box” functionality. You can add additional data to those events by using custom attributes. If you determine that you need to collect custom data, review custom data requirements, and report custom event data. For more detailed information about sending custom data, check out these New Relic University tutorials: APM custom data overview Adding custom events using the API 4. Create baselines In order to validate the value of moving to the cloud, you need to get baselines for your applications before you move to the cloud. Define pre-migration baselines for applications and their underlying infrastructures that you have designated for cloud service improvements based on your KPIs. To stay on top of your KPIs as you are moving, create baseline alerts for applications monitored by APM and browser and use NRQL alerts to get notified on any spikes or drops in your KPIs. The following dashboard tracks key performance indicators for applications designated to move to the cloud: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > Create a dashboard: Create dashboards to track your KPIs. After you migrate applications to the cloud, apply the same criteria to post-migration baselines so you can compare your results from before and after your migration. 5. Validate improvements with Dashboards Dashboards is a single location to view all the data that New Relic products gather. Use New Relic Dashboards to visualize your KPIs before and after your move: Transaction and TransactionError event types with APM PageView and PageAction event types with browser Default Infrastructure events and attributes for your systems, processes, events, storage, and network, Infrastructure integrations, and custom attributes Mobile event types with Mobile SyntheticCheck, SyntheticRequest, and SyntheticPrivateMinion event types with Synthetics The following dashboard shows KPI data used to validate cloud improvements: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > Create a dashboard: Create dashboards to track your KPIs pre- and post-migration.

      "body": "Cloud migrations can take many forms. Some companies choose to port their applications directly from their data center to the cloud (a “Lift and Shift” migration) while others focus on completely re-architecting their applications to take advantage of benefits available only in the cloud. No matter your approach, there are three primary questions you want to answer after your migration: Has my application gotten slower? Is my application less stable than before? Am I losing customers due to either of the previous questions? To answer these questions, start by performing some basic testing to establish a baseline for the performance and availability of your systems. A baseline is a measurement of the current performance and availability of your application, which you then use as a comparison after your migration to validate your business case. In some cases, you may change a baseline when you perform migration acceptance testing. You can also use a baseline as a comparison point during your migration to make sure that you are on track. 1. Identify components Before you begin a cloud migration, identify all the tiers of your entire application stack. List all of the components (applications, services, etc.) that you want to migrate. Segment the application stack as follows: Application (backend/microservices/cron jobs) Dependency services, such as the message queue Database Website Underlying server and infrastructure Tip Make sure that you have access to applications and instances before you start creating application baselines. Engage your application owners, DevOps engineers, and product managers for access. Example: List of components Here is an example of the list of components in an application stack: Component Name Owner Language Stack Accessibility (Internet, Intranet) Operating System Service 1 John Doe Java Internet RHEL 6 Service 2 Maya Wiz .NET Intranet Win2003 R2 RabbitMQ John Doe Java Intranet AIX Website Maya Wiz Classic ASP Internet Win2000 MS SQL Dave Z NA Intranet Win2003 R2 2. Determine compatibility Once you identify the applications that you want to migrate, it is time to verify which application tiers to monitor with the New Relic platform. Work with stakeholders in your organization to determine the amount of instrumentation that is possible–or allowed–within your organization. This is an important step and one that will pay off, as the more you can instrument, the better your baselines. Here are the New Relic products to use for baselining, depending on the components that you identified: APM: Monitor your web apps with APM. See Compatibility and requirements for New Relic agents and products to learn precise compatibility details for each supported language. Infrastructure: Monitor your hosts with infrastructure. See Compatibility and requirements for infrastructure for supported operating systems and environments. You can also instrument other products and services with on-host integrations. Synthetics: Monitor web frontends and APIs with synthetics. Sometimes, you may not be able to instrument your on-premise environment with APM or Infrastructure. For example, maybe your organization's policy forbids installing an agent behind a firewall. In these cases, if the application has a web frontend, use Synthetics, as it offers non-agent monitoring while still providing the ability to establish a baseline. Example: Components matched to New Relic products Match the components that you identified with their corresponding products: Component Name Tier Owner Language Stack Accessibility (Internet/ Intranet) Operating System New Relic Products Service 1 John Doe Java Internet RHEL 6 APM, Infrastructure, Synthetics Service 2 Maya Wiz .NET Intranet Win2003 R2 APM, Infrastructure ActiveMQ John Doe Java Intranet AIX APM, Plugin Website Maya Wiz Classic ASP Internet Win2000 Synthetics MS SQL Dave Z n/a Intranet Win2003 R2 Infrastructure, On-host Integration 3. Deploy monitoring Based on the component-product matches you made, deploy agents or monitors across your architecture: Deploy APM Install the APM agent on your application stack. The steps to install the APM agent are different based on language. Deploy New Relic Infrastructure After reviewing the requirements for infrastructure, follow the instructions to install the infrastructure agent on your hosts: Install for Linux Install for Windows Server Install on AWS Elastic Beanstalk Install with a configuration management tool Deploy Infrastructure on-host integrations To gain extended visibility into applications that your code depends on, deploy on-host integrations. Available integrations include Apache, MySQL, NGINX, and others. Create New Relic Synthetics monitors New Relic Synthetics is a suite of automated, scriptable tools to monitor your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. To get started add a monitor. Tip Make sure to verify that your website URL is accessible from the public network. You may also need to add New Relic IPs to your allow list. 4. Gather metrics After you deploy the agents and monitors, identify which metrics are the most important to your business and use these metrics to define your KPIs. Some recommendations include: Response time: Time taken to respond to a request. Throughput: Number of requests that came in through the application. Requesting queuing (Apache, IIS, NGINX): Duration of time taken for a request to reach your application. Database call duration: Duration of time taken to complete a database call. DB call counts: Number of calls made by application code to the database. Error rate: Percent of errors reported. Apdex score: An industry standard to measure user satisfaction with the response time of web applications and services. DNS setup timing: The time it takes to connect and receive data from DNS. SSL setup timing: The time it takes to establish an SSL connection. You can find some of these metrics in service maps, as well as on APM, and [browser] (/docs/ /new-relic-browser/getting-started/browser-overview-page-website-performance-summary) overview pages. For more detailed information about navigating, interpreting, and using APM, check out these New Relic University’s tutorials: Overview dashboard tour Transactions dashboard Understanding Apdex 5. Set up Dashboards After you define your KPIs, it is easy to visualize them in dashboards. Dashboards provide a single location to view all the data that New Relic products gather. Dashboards data consists of events, and each event has an event type, a timestamp, and key-value attributes. For more information about events, see Data collection and Default events for New Relic products. You can locate your KPIs and business metrics data in New Relic using the data explorer and the NRQL query language. You can also build dashboards to track the performance of those KPIs: Example: Component performance compared against baselines Continuing the examples in this document, the following table illustrates the maturity of your application performance over a period of time based on deployment milestones. Each milestone will serve as a new baseline for your applications: Component Milestone 1 Milestone 2 Milestone N Environment Component Name Response Time SLA Apdex Response Time SLA Apdex Response On-Prem Service 1 1.5 secs 80% 70% 1.5 secs 68% 0.65 1.4 secs Cloud Service 1 0.9 secs 96.8% 95% 0.9 secs 98% 0.99 0.7 secs On-Prem Service 2 0.7 secs 73% 68% 0.7 secs 80% 0.78 0.85 secs Cloud Service 2 0.6 secs 90% 92% 0.6 secs 89% 0.90 0.5 secs After your migration, compare these baselines against your migration acceptance testing baselines. Expert tips If you find that you need data that is not captured by default instrumentation, New Relic makes it easy to capture custom data: APM custom instrumentation Browser custom data Infrastructure custom attributes Custom event data Mobile custom data Synthetics custom attributes You can also learn more about APM custom instrumentation with the New Relic University Custom data tutorial series.",

      "body": "When you are planning a migration to the cloud, it is important to analyze your current on-premise architecture and identify the scope of your migration. When you have a full understanding of your applications, your hosts, and their architecture, you reduce the possibility of missing dependencies during your migration. 1. Identify applications and components First, you need to determine the level of instrumentation that is possible or allowed within your organization. The deeper you instrument, the more visibility you gain into your applications. Then, address the scope of your cloud migration by answering the following questions and keeping track of your answers: What applications do I need to include in the migration? What are the dependencies of each application? What are the underlying services/inventory supporting these applications? 2. Install New Relic agents Based on your answers when you determined the scope of your cloud migration, verify that the applications that you want to migrate are compatible with New Relic products and install the agents: APM APM delivers data about your application's performance, providing information about app availability and external services so you can visualize your application dependencies. Confirm that your system meets the requirements for the APM agents that you want to install, and then install the APM agent on your application stack. Steps for installing APM agents vary based on language. Infrastructure Infrastructure monitoring provides flexible, dynamic server monitoring so you can inventory your hosts and their configuration settings. Confirm that your underlying infrastructure meets the requirements for infrastructure. Install the infrastructure agent on instances that host your applications. Infrastructure on-host integrations Infrastructure on-host integrations monitor the services that your code depends on. Install the on-host integrations for the services that you are using. 3. Visualize application dependencies with APM After you install the APM agent, use service maps to get a full view of your application’s architecture. Service maps allow you to identify any connections from applications to external services, web services, databases, or APIs. After creating a service map for the application that has dependencies that you want to explore, add an application node on the map. Then, begin to add connections to the map including databases, external services, third-party APIs, and even browser-monitored applications. New Relic pulls every node you add into the map, and you can watch the shape of your architecture emerge. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Service map: View a service map to see a visual overview of your system architecture and the health of entities. Based on the visibility into internal and external dependencies that the service map provides, you can create a migration plan that includes all aspects of an application’s ecosystem. 4. Inventory underlining instances with Infrastructure New Relic Infrastructure's inventory page gives you visibility into the software packages installed on your servers. Essentially, the inventory page displays detailed information about a system’s per-host configuration, including details about system modules, configuration files, metadata, packages, services, and user sessions. The inventory page provides a real-time, filterable, searchable view into each host’s configuration. The inventory page not only provides you with the list of packages installed but also provides version information as well. Use this version information to know which packages to upgrade and which packages to replicate for your cloud migration. It also helps you track the dependencies between the software packages and configuration files. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Inventory: View the inventory page for details about your hosts and their configurations. You can also use the Inventory page to get a sense of what software or packages you no longer need, which is a great way to “clean up” your servers before you migrate to the cloud. 5. Uncover unknown applications and components Since anything can happen during an application’s lifecycle, like an application changing ownership, you may come across applications or component dependencies that you did not know about. If you discover any unknown dependencies, assess their relationship to other applications and components in your infrastructure to determine if they should be pulled into your migration plan. If you discover any applications or components while viewing service maps or while reviewing the inventory page, remember to instrument them before you migrate them. 6. Resolve errors or other issues After you instrument your applications, APM may uncover errors or issues with your current on-prem applications. Use APM error analytics to determine the root cause of any errors or issues in your applications. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors: Use error analytics to determine the root cause of errors in your applications. Start with the Error rate chart to see if there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or error patterns. Correlate any patterns on the Top 5 errors chart to alerts occurring during the same time period. The Error traces table includes specific stack trace details, such as associated host, user, framework code, and custom attributes to help you identify the root cause of an error. 7. Create Dashboards In addition to the application baselines you built, create dashboards to assess your on-premises applications in preparation for migrating them to the cloud. Use Dashboards to gain visibility into the average response times, the top transactions, the associated average duration, and the overall CPU usage for your instrumented application. Drill down into individual applications to see your top processes and the CPU percent for each process. You can also view an error analysis for a set of instrumented applications: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > (select a dashboard): View errors visualize issues with your applications. Check out the best practices guide for tips on creating and utilizing dashboards. Sharing New Relic Dashboards with your teams and stakeholders is a powerful way to communicate the impact of your migration during your cloud adoption process.

To make sure that your tags are usable across most cloud providers: Use only lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes. Keep keys and values under 63 characters. New Relic reports data contained in specific events to your account as part of its “out-of-the-box” functionality. You can add additional data to those events by using custom attributes. If you determine that you need to collect custom data, review custom data requirements, and report custom event data. For more detailed information about sending custom data, check out these New Relic University tutorials: APM custom data overview Adding custom events using the API 4. Create baselines In order to validate the value of moving to the cloud, you need to get baselines for your applications before you move to the cloud. Define pre-migration baselines for applications and their underlying infrastructures that you have designated for cloud service improvements based on your KPIs. To stay on top of your KPIs as you are moving, create baseline alerts for applications monitored by APM and browser and use NRQL alerts to get notified on any spikes or drops in your KPIs. The following dashboard tracks key performance indicators for applications designated to move to the cloud: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > Create a dashboard: Create dashboards to track your KPIs. After you migrate applications to the cloud, apply the same criteria to post-migration baselines so you can compare your results from before and after your migration. 5. Validate improvements with Dashboards Dashboards is a single location to view all the data that New Relic products gather. Use New Relic Dashboards to visualize your KPIs before and after your move: Transaction and TransactionError event types with APM PageView and PageAction event types with browser Default Infrastructure events and attributes for your systems, processes, events, storage, and network, Infrastructure integrations, and custom attributes Mobile event types with Mobile SyntheticCheck, SyntheticRequest, and SyntheticPrivateMinion event types with Synthetics The following dashboard shows KPI data used to validate cloud improvements: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > Create a dashboard: Create dashboards to track your KPIs pre- and post-migration. Use dashboards to validate the value of adopting a new cloud service and to answer key questions about application performance and customer experience.",

      "body": "Cloud migrations can take many forms. Some companies choose to port their applications directly from their data center to the cloud (a “Lift and Shift” migration) while others focus on completely re-architecting their applications to take advantage of benefits available only in the cloud. No matter your approach, there are three primary questions you want to answer after your migration: Has my application gotten slower? Is my application less stable than before? Am I losing customers due to either of the previous questions? To answer these questions, start by performing some basic testing to establish a baseline for the performance and availability of your systems. A baseline is a measurement of the current performance and availability of your application, which you then use as a comparison after your migration to validate your business case. In some cases, you may change a baseline when you perform migration acceptance testing. You can also use a baseline as a comparison point during your migration to make sure that you are on track. 1. Identify components Before you begin a cloud migration, identify all the tiers of your entire application stack. List all of the components (applications, services, etc.) that you want to migrate. Segment the application stack as follows: Application (backend/microservices/cron jobs) Dependency services, such as the message queue Database Website Underlying server and infrastructure Tip Make sure that you have access to applications and instances before you start creating application baselines. Engage your application owners, DevOps engineers, and product managers for access. Example: List of components Here is an example of the list of components in an application stack: Component Name Owner Language Stack Accessibility (Internet, Intranet) Operating System Service 1 John Doe Java Internet RHEL 6 Service 2 Maya Wiz .NET Intranet Win2003 R2 RabbitMQ John Doe Java Intranet AIX Website Maya Wiz Classic ASP Internet Win2000 MS SQL Dave Z NA Intranet Win2003 R2 2. Determine compatibility Once you identify the applications that you want to migrate, it is time to verify which application tiers to monitor with the New Relic platform. Work with stakeholders in your organization to determine the amount of instrumentation that is possible–or allowed–within your organization. This is an important step and one that will pay off, as the more you can instrument, the better your baselines. Here are the New Relic products to use for baselining, depending on the components that you identified: APM: Monitor your web apps with APM. See Compatibility and requirements for New Relic agents and products to learn precise compatibility details for each supported language. Infrastructure: Monitor your hosts with infrastructure. See Compatibility and requirements for infrastructure for supported operating systems and environments. You can also instrument other products and services with on-host integrations. Synthetics: Monitor web frontends and APIs with synthetics. Sometimes, you may not be able to instrument your on-premise environment with APM or Infrastructure. For example, maybe your organization's policy forbids installing an agent behind a firewall. In these cases, if the application has a web frontend, use Synthetics, as it offers non-agent monitoring while still providing the ability to establish a baseline. Example: Components matched to New Relic products Match the components that you identified with their corresponding products: Component Name Tier Owner Language Stack Accessibility (Internet/ Intranet) Operating System New Relic Products Service 1 John Doe Java Internet RHEL 6 APM, Infrastructure, Synthetics Service 2 Maya Wiz .NET Intranet Win2003 R2 APM, Infrastructure ActiveMQ John Doe Java Intranet AIX APM, Plugin Website Maya Wiz Classic ASP Internet Win2000 Synthetics MS SQL Dave Z n/a Intranet Win2003 R2 Infrastructure, On-host Integration 3. Deploy monitoring Based on the component-product matches you made, deploy agents or monitors across your architecture: Deploy APM Install the APM agent on your application stack. The steps to install the APM agent are different based on language. Deploy New Relic Infrastructure After reviewing the requirements for infrastructure, follow the instructions to install the infrastructure agent on your hosts: Install for Linux Install for Windows Server Install on AWS Elastic Beanstalk Install with a configuration management tool Deploy Infrastructure on-host integrations To gain extended visibility into applications that your code depends on, deploy on-host integrations. Available integrations include Apache, MySQL, NGINX, and others. Create New Relic Synthetics monitors New Relic Synthetics is a suite of automated, scriptable tools to monitor your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. To get started add a monitor. Tip Make sure to verify that your website URL is accessible from the public network. You may also need to add New Relic IPs to your allow list. 4. Gather metrics After you deploy the agents and monitors, identify which metrics are the most important to your business and use these metrics to define your KPIs. Some recommendations include: Response time: Time taken to respond to a request. Throughput: Number of requests that came in through the application. Requesting queuing (Apache, IIS, NGINX): Duration of time taken for a request to reach your application. Database call duration: Duration of time taken to complete a database call. DB call counts: Number of calls made by application code to the database. Error rate: Percent of errors reported. Apdex score: An industry standard to measure user satisfaction with the response time of web applications and services. DNS setup timing: The time it takes to connect and receive data from DNS. SSL setup timing: The time it takes to establish an SSL connection. You can find some of these metrics in service maps, as well as on APM, and [browser] (/docs/ /new-relic-browser/getting-started/browser-overview-page-website-performance-summary) overview pages. For more detailed information about navigating, interpreting, and using APM, check out these New Relic University’s tutorials: Overview dashboard tour Transactions dashboard Understanding Apdex 5. Set up Dashboards After you define your KPIs, it is easy to visualize them in dashboards. Dashboards provide a single location to view all the data that New Relic products gather. Dashboards data consists of events, and each event has an event type, a timestamp, and key-value attributes. For more information about events, see Data collection and Default events for New Relic products. You can locate your KPIs and business metrics data in New Relic using the data explorer and the NRQL query language. You can also build dashboards to track the performance of those KPIs: Example: Component performance compared against baselines Continuing the examples in this document, the following table illustrates the maturity of your application performance over a period of time based on deployment milestones. Each milestone will serve as a new baseline for your applications: Component Milestone 1 Milestone 2 Milestone N Environment Component Name Response Time SLA Apdex Response Time SLA Apdex Response On-Prem Service 1 1.5 secs 80% 70% 1.5 secs 68% 0.65 1.4 secs Cloud Service 1 0.9 secs 96.8% 95% 0.9 secs 98% 0.99 0.7 secs On-Prem Service 2 0.7 secs 73% 68% 0.7 secs 80% 0.78 0.85 secs Cloud Service 2 0.6 secs 90% 92% 0.6 secs 89% 0.90 0.5 secs After your migration, compare these baselines against your migration acceptance testing baselines. Expert tips If you find that you need data that is not captured by default instrumentation, New Relic makes it easy to capture custom data: APM custom instrumentation Browser custom data Infrastructure custom attributes Custom event data Mobile custom data Synthetics custom attributes You can also learn more about APM custom instrumentation with the New Relic University Custom data tutorial series.",

      "body": "As you migrate your applications to the cloud, you want to catch and correct any unexpected behavior or outcomes as soon as possible. Detecting errors and issues related to your new cloud architecture, performance, and scale is critical—getting the right information at the right time can be the difference between success and failure. 1. Identify components Create a list all of applications, services, and their underlying server infrastructures in your application portfolio that you want to migrate to the cloud. 2. Identify KPIs To provide quantifiable measures that your teams can use to assess your migration, identify a list of corporate KPIs (key performance indicators). Using the New Relic platform to measure KPIs helps you eliminate blindspots and see the connections between entities—from your application code, to your cloud infrastructure (including containers running in highly distributed microservices), to your customer experience. Your goal is to create a collection of metrics in several categories that you can visualize in our Dashboards. To validate cloud improvements, group KPIs in the following categories, from least to most strong: Application and infrastructure performance End-user experience, including website and mobile application performance Audience and content trends DevOps productivity Application revenue analytics Future business goals 3. Deploy monitoring tools To start monitoring your KPIs, verify that the applications that you want to migrate are compatible with the requirements for the New Relic products you will use. Then, install the New Relic agents: Deploy APM Review the compatibility and requirements and then install APM agents on your application stack. After installing the APM agents, review the architecture of the applications that you instrumented with an APM agent. Take note of all hosts that are part of each tier of the application stack (database, application, web server, etc.), so you can install infrastructure monitoring agents on each of those hosts. Deploy browser monitoring In a nutshell, browser monitoring is a snippet of JavaScript that needs to appear in all of your application's webpages. It has no dependencies on other libraries, so it does not cause additional delays when bringing jQuery or other frameworks into the webpage. There are three ways to install the browser agent: Method When to use this method Enable via APM Typically, the quickest path is to let the APM agent dynamically inject the snippet into your pages on the server side. This works for many common web technologies, such as .NET, JSP, and other Java solutions. The documentation provides a complete reference for the languages and frameworks that allow this option. Copy/paste method If you are using an unsupported framework or are in an environment where you can instrument only the webpages but cannot install APM on the backend, use the copy-paste method. The UI generates a simple JavaScript snippet. Copy that snippet, and paste it into a global page template on your end to get browser monitoring deployed across your site. Enable via the API You can perform a manual instrumentation, in which your developers add instrumentation to your webpages using a server-side API. New Relic supports this for many server-side languages. Refer to the documentation for an example of how to do this in Java. Deploy New Relic Infrastructure After reviewing the requirements for New Relic Infrastructure, install the Infrastructure agent on the hosts that you identified so you can start to gather data for your KPIs. Tip If you use Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for automation, you can use those tools to deploy Infrastructure agents to your hosts. Set up alerts New Relic Alerts is a single integrated solution with a centralized UI to help you focus on the metrics that you care about most. When you set up New Relic Alerts and NRQL alerting, you establish flexible policies and conditions to receive alerts and notifications on multiple channels (email, Slack, OpsGenie, etc.). For more detailed information about creating, managing, and using alerts, check out the New Relic University tutorials. 4. Set up cloud integrations Tip Cloud-based integrations available through New Relic include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. Once your applications are migrated to the cloud and you start to integrate new cloud services, you can use New Relic to monitor and report data about your cloud services, offering you a comprehensive view of your entire architecture in one place. For example, to capture and record AWS account activity for audit and governance purposes, use the New Relic AWS CloudTrail integration. Tracking error events gives you awareness about API calls and services that have failed, while console logins help you monitor console activity and potential intrusion attempts. New Relic collects this event data so you can display it in a Dashboard or alert on it with NRQL. To gain extended visibility into applications that your code depends on, you can also deploy on-host integrations for commonly used application components, such as MySQL, Apache, and NGINX. In addition, you can create your own custom on-host integration with the New Relic Integrations SDK. 5. Identify issues and roadblocks Once your applications are running in the cloud, they may generate new types of errors that are different from the errors that they generated when running on-premise. You can use New Relic APM and browser monitoring to view error events, error metrics, and detailed error traces for your applications. If an error or unhandled exception happens, the data appears on the JavaScript errors page and the APM Error analytics page. From these pages, you can quickly troubleshoot runtime errors. Then, further analyze errors by grouping them according to attributes, by filtering them, or by searching for keywords in the event data. Each unhandled exception generates a transaction error event in Insights, and the dashboards are updated in real-time. Event data is a record of a single event at a particular moment in time and consists of default attributes, like a timestamp, and an event type. You can also add custom attributes to provide more context. Tip Once you start capturing JavaScript errors as events in Insights, set up NRQL alerting so you can stay on top of your error data. Use the JavaScript errors page to get visibility into real-time user experience: one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors: Use the charts on this page to get visibility into the real-time user experience. Then, create a Dashboard that covers a longer period of time and aligns the error and unhandled exception data with your KPIs: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > Create a dashboard: Use dashboards to align the error and unhandled exception data with your KPIs. Expert tip for alerting on JavaScript errors To get notifications for error spikes that are different from known or common JavaScript errors, use the following NRQL query for browser-monitored: SELECT count(*) FROM JavaScriptError WHERE appName = '<BrowserAppName>' AND errorClass NOT IN ('<ErrorClass1>','<ErrorClass2>') Copy Replace <BrowserAppName> with the browser app name that you want to monitor with this alert. Replace <ErrorClass1> and <ErrorClass2> with the on-premise error class names that you do not want New Relic to alert you about. Set the threshold based on your alerting needs. Using this query, New Relic alerts you every time a JavaScript error occurs when it has an error class that is not normally reported.",

      "body": "When you are planning a migration to the cloud, it is important to analyze your current on-premise architecture and identify the scope of your migration. When you have a full understanding of your applications, your hosts, and their architecture, you reduce the possibility of missing dependencies during your migration. 1. Identify applications and components First, you need to determine the level of instrumentation that is possible or allowed within your organization. The deeper you instrument, the more visibility you gain into your applications. Then, address the scope of your cloud migration by answering the following questions and keeping track of your answers: What applications do I need to include in the migration? What are the dependencies of each application? What are the underlying services/inventory supporting these applications? 2. Install New Relic agents Based on your answers when you determined the scope of your cloud migration, verify that the applications that you want to migrate are compatible with New Relic products and install the agents: APM APM delivers data about your application's performance, providing information about app availability and external services so you can visualize your application dependencies. Confirm that your system meets the requirements for the APM agents that you want to install, and then install the APM agent on your application stack. Steps for installing APM agents vary based on language. Infrastructure Infrastructure monitoring provides flexible, dynamic server monitoring so you can inventory your hosts and their configuration settings. Confirm that your underlying infrastructure meets the requirements for infrastructure. Install the infrastructure agent on instances that host your applications. Infrastructure on-host integrations Infrastructure on-host integrations monitor the services that your code depends on. Install the on-host integrations for the services that you are using. 3. Visualize application dependencies with APM After you install the APM agent, use service maps to get a full view of your application’s architecture. Service maps allow you to identify any connections from applications to external services, web services, databases, or APIs. After creating a service map for the application that has dependencies that you want to explore, add an application node on the map. Then, begin to add connections to the map including databases, external services, third-party APIs, and even browser-monitored applications. New Relic pulls every node you add into the map, and you can watch the shape of your architecture emerge. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Service map: View a service map to see a visual overview of your system architecture and the health of entities. Based on the visibility into internal and external dependencies that the service map provides, you can create a migration plan that includes all aspects of an application’s ecosystem. 4. Inventory underlining instances with Infrastructure New Relic Infrastructure's inventory page gives you visibility into the software packages installed on your servers. Essentially, the inventory page displays detailed information about a system’s per-host configuration, including details about system modules, configuration files, metadata, packages, services, and user sessions. The inventory page provides a real-time, filterable, searchable view into each host’s configuration. The inventory page not only provides you with the list of packages installed but also provides version information as well. Use this version information to know which packages to upgrade and which packages to replicate for your cloud migration. It also helps you track the dependencies between the software packages and configuration files. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Inventory: View the inventory page for details about your hosts and their configurations. You can also use the Inventory page to get a sense of what software or packages you no longer need, which is a great way to “clean up” your servers before you migrate to the cloud. 5. Uncover unknown applications and components Since anything can happen during an application’s lifecycle, like an application changing ownership, you may come across applications or component dependencies that you did not know about. If you discover any unknown dependencies, assess their relationship to other applications and components in your infrastructure to determine if they should be pulled into your migration plan. If you discover any applications or components while viewing service maps or while reviewing the inventory page, remember to instrument them before you migrate them. 6. Resolve errors or other issues After you instrument your applications, APM may uncover errors or issues with your current on-prem applications. Use APM error analytics to determine the root cause of any errors or issues in your applications. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors: Use error analytics to determine the root cause of errors in your applications. Start with the Error rate chart to see if there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or error patterns. Correlate any patterns on the Top 5 errors chart to alerts occurring during the same time period. The Error traces table includes specific stack trace details, such as associated host, user, framework code, and custom attributes to help you identify the root cause of an error. 7. Create Dashboards In addition to the application baselines you built, create dashboards to assess your on-premises applications in preparation for migrating them to the cloud. Use Dashboards to gain visibility into the average response times, the top transactions, the associated average duration, and the overall CPU usage for your instrumented application. Drill down into individual applications to see your top processes and the CPU percent for each process. You can also view an error analysis for a set of instrumented applications: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > (select a dashboard): View errors visualize issues with your applications. Check out the best practices guide for tips on creating and utilizing dashboards. Sharing New Relic Dashboards with your teams and stakeholders is a powerful way to communicate the impact of your migration during your cloud adoption process.

Identify KPIs To provide quantifiable measures that your teams can use to assess your migration, identify a list of corporate KPIs (key performance indicators). Using the New Relic platform to measure KPIs helps you eliminate blind spots and see the connections between entities—from your application code to your cloud infrastructure (including containers running in highly distributed microservices), to your customer experience. Your goal is to create a collection of metrics in several categories that you can visualize in dashboards in New Relic Dashboards. To validate cloud improvements, group KPIs in the following categories, from least to most strong: Application and infrastructure performance End-user experience, including website and mobile application performance Audience and content trends DevOps productivity Application revenue analytics Future business goals 2. Deploy monitoring tools To start monitoring your KPIs, verify that the applications that you want to migrate are compatible with the requirements for the New Relic products you want to use. Then, install the New Relic agents: Install APM Review the compatibility and requirements and then install APM agents on your application stack. After installing the APM agents, review the architecture of the applications you instrumented with an APM agent. Take note of all hosts that are part of each tier of the application stack (database, application, web server, etc.), so you can install New Relic Infrastructure agents on each of those hosts. Install infrastructure After reviewing the requirements for New Relic Infrastructure, install the infrastructure agent on the hosts that you identified so you can start to gather data for your KPIs. Tip If you use Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for automation, you can use those tools to deploy Infrastructure agents to your hosts. Install infrastructure integrations You can also monitor and report data about services that your code depends on using New Relic integrations. New Relic offers cloud integrations for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform as well as on-host integrations. Tip If you are using AWS as a cloud provider, take advantage of New Relic’s AWS billing integrations to stay on top of your budget and prove the success of your migration. 3. Gather custom data To manage, search for, and filter resources, assign metadata to your cloud resources in the form of tags. Tags are labels that consist of key-value pairs that you use to annotate your Infrastructure data. Tag formats are different between AWS, Azure, and Google. Google, for example, has the shortest allowable lengths for keys and values. In addition, they all have different requirements for case sensitivity and allowable characters. To make sure that your tags are usable across most cloud providers: Use only lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes. Keep keys and values under 63 characters. New Relic reports data contained in specific events to your account as part of its “out-of-the-box” functionality. You can add additional data to those events by using custom attributes. If you determine that you need to collect custom data, review custom data requirements, and report custom event data. For more detailed information about sending custom data, check out these New Relic University tutorials: APM custom data overview Adding custom events using the API 4. Create baselines In order to validate the value of moving to the cloud, you need to get baselines for your applications before you move to the cloud. Define pre-migration baselines for applications and their underlying infrastructures that you have designated for cloud service improvements based on your KPIs. To stay on top of your KPIs as you are moving, create baseline alerts for applications monitored by APM and browser and use NRQL alerts to get notified on any spikes or drops in your KPIs. The following dashboard tracks key performance indicators for applications designated to move to the cloud: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > Create a dashboard: Create dashboards to track your KPIs. After you migrate applications to the cloud, apply the same criteria to post-migration baselines so you can compare your results from before and after your migration. 5. Validate improvements with Dashboards Dashboards is a single location to view all the data that New Relic products gather. Use New Relic Dashboards to visualize your KPIs before and after your move: Transaction and TransactionError event types with APM PageView and PageAction event types with browser Default Infrastructure events and attributes for your systems, processes, events, storage, and network, Infrastructure integrations, and custom attributes Mobile event types with Mobile SyntheticCheck, SyntheticRequest, and SyntheticPrivateMinion event types with Synthetics The following dashboard shows KPI data used to validate cloud improvements: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > Create a dashboard: Create dashboards to track your KPIs pre- and post-migration.

      "body": "As you migrate your applications to the cloud, you want to catch and correct any unexpected behavior or outcomes as soon as possible. Detecting errors and issues related to your new cloud architecture, performance, and scale is critical—getting the right information at the right time can be the difference between success and failure. 1. Identify components Create a list all of applications, services, and their underlying server infrastructures in your application portfolio that you want to migrate to the cloud. 2. Identify KPIs To provide quantifiable measures that your teams can use to assess your migration, identify a list of corporate KPIs (key performance indicators).

Your goal is to create a collection of metrics in several categories that you can visualize in our Dashboards. To validate cloud improvements, group KPIs in the following categories, from least to most strong: Application and infrastructure performance End-user experience, including website and mobile application performance Audience and content trends DevOps productivity Application revenue analytics Future business goals 3. Deploy monitoring tools To start monitoring your KPIs, verify that the applications that you want to migrate are compatible with the requirements for the New Relic products you will use. Then, install the New Relic agents: Deploy APM Review the compatibility and requirements and then install APM agents on your application stack. After installing the APM agents, review the architecture of the applications that you instrumented with an APM agent. Take note of all hosts that are part of each tier of the application stack (database, application, web server, etc.), so you can install infrastructure monitoring agents on each of those hosts. Deploy browser monitoring In a nutshell, browser monitoring is a snippet of JavaScript that needs to appear in all of your application's webpages. It has no dependencies on other libraries, so it does not cause additional delays when bringing jQuery or other frameworks into the webpage. There are three ways to install the browser agent: Method When to use this method Enable via APM Typically, the quickest path is to let the APM agent dynamically inject the snippet into your pages on the server side. This works for many common web technologies, such as .NET, JSP, and other Java solutions. The documentation provides a complete reference for the languages and frameworks that allow this option. Copy/paste method If you are using an unsupported framework or are in an environment where you can instrument only the webpages but cannot install APM on the backend, use the copy-paste method. The UI generates a simple JavaScript snippet. Copy that snippet, and paste it into a global page template on your end to get browser monitoring deployed across your site. Enable via the API You can perform a manual instrumentation, in which your developers add instrumentation to your webpages using a server-side API. New Relic supports this for many server-side languages. Refer to the documentation for an example of how to do this in Java. Deploy New Relic Infrastructure After reviewing the requirements for New Relic Infrastructure, install the Infrastructure agent on the hosts that you identified so you can start to gather data for your KPIs. Tip If you use Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for automation, you can use those tools to deploy Infrastructure agents to your hosts. Set up alerts New Relic Alerts is a single integrated solution with a centralized UI to help you focus on the metrics that you care about most. When you set up New Relic Alerts and NRQL alerting, you establish flexible policies and conditions to receive alerts and notifications on multiple channels (email, Slack, OpsGenie, etc.). For more detailed information about creating, managing, and using alerts, check out the New Relic University tutorials. 4. Set up cloud integrations Tip Cloud-based integrations available through New Relic include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. Once your applications are migrated to the cloud and you start to integrate new cloud services, you can use New Relic to monitor and report data about your cloud services, offering you a comprehensive view of your entire architecture in one place. For example, to capture and record AWS account activity for audit and governance purposes, use the New Relic AWS CloudTrail integration. Tracking error events gives you awareness about API calls and services that have failed, while console logins help you monitor console activity and potential intrusion attempts. New Relic collects this event data so you can display it in a Dashboard or alert on it with NRQL. To gain extended visibility into applications that your code depends on, you can also deploy on-host integrations for commonly used application components, such as MySQL, Apache, and NGINX. In addition, you can create your own custom on-host integration with the New Relic Integrations SDK. 5. Identify issues and roadblocks Once your applications are running in the cloud, they may generate new types of errors that are different from the errors that they generated when running on-premise. You can use New Relic APM and browser monitoring to view error events, error metrics, and detailed error traces for your applications. If an error or unhandled exception happens, the data appears on the JavaScript errors page and the APM Error analytics page. From these pages, you can quickly troubleshoot runtime errors. Then, further analyze errors by grouping them according to attributes, by filtering them, or by searching for keywords in the event data. Each unhandled exception generates a transaction error event in Insights, and the dashboards are updated in real-time. Event data is a record of a single event at a particular moment in time and consists of default attributes, like a timestamp, and an event type. You can also add custom attributes to provide more context. Tip Once you start capturing JavaScript errors as events in Insights, set up NRQL alerting so you can stay on top of your error data. Use the JavaScript errors page to get visibility into real-time user experience: one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors: Use the charts on this page to get visibility into the real-time user experience. Then, create a Dashboard that covers a longer period of time and aligns the error and unhandled exception data with your KPIs: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > Create a dashboard: Use dashboards to align the error and unhandled exception data with your KPIs. Expert tip for alerting on JavaScript errors To get notifications for error spikes that are different from known or common JavaScript errors, use the following NRQL query for browser-monitored: SELECT count(*) FROM JavaScriptError WHERE appName = '<BrowserAppName>' AND errorClass NOT IN ('<ErrorClass1>','<ErrorClass2>') Copy Replace <BrowserAppName> with the browser app name that you want to monitor with this alert. Replace <ErrorClass1> and <ErrorClass2> with the on-premise error class names that you do not want New Relic to alert you about. Set the threshold based on your alerting needs. Using this query, New Relic alerts you every time a JavaScript error occurs when it has an error class that is not normally reported.",

      "body": "When you are planning a migration to the cloud, it is important to analyze your current on-premise architecture and identify the scope of your migration. When you have a full understanding of your applications, your hosts, and their architecture, you reduce the possibility of missing dependencies during your migration. 1. Identify applications and components First, you need to determine the level of instrumentation that is possible or allowed within your organization. The deeper you instrument, the more visibility you gain into your applications. Then, address the scope of your cloud migration by answering the following questions and keeping track of your answers: What applications do I need to include in the migration? What are the dependencies of each application? What are the underlying services/inventory supporting these applications? 2. Install New Relic agents Based on your answers when you determined the scope of your cloud migration, verify that the applications that you want to migrate are compatible with New Relic products and install the agents: APM APM delivers data about your application's performance, providing information about app availability and external services so you can visualize your application dependencies. Confirm that your system meets the requirements for the APM agents that you want to install, and then install the APM agent on your application stack. Steps for installing APM agents vary based on language. Infrastructure Infrastructure monitoring provides flexible, dynamic server monitoring so you can inventory your hosts and their configuration settings. Confirm that your underlying infrastructure meets the requirements for infrastructure. Install the infrastructure agent on instances that host your applications. Infrastructure on-host integrations Infrastructure on-host integrations monitor the services that your code depends on. Install the on-host integrations for the services that you are using. 3. Visualize application dependencies with APM After you install the APM agent, use service maps to get a full view of your application’s architecture. Service maps allow you to identify any connections from applications to external services, web services, databases, or APIs. After creating a service map for the application that has dependencies that you want to explore, add an application node on the map. Then, begin to add connections to the map including databases, external services, third-party APIs, and even browser-monitored applications. New Relic pulls every node you add into the map, and you can watch the shape of your architecture emerge. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Service map: View a service map to see a visual overview of your system architecture and the health of entities. Based on the visibility into internal and external dependencies that the service map provides, you can create a migration plan that includes all aspects of an application’s ecosystem. 4. Inventory underlining instances with Infrastructure New Relic Infrastructure's inventory page gives you visibility into the software packages installed on your servers. Essentially, the inventory page displays detailed information about a system’s per-host configuration, including details about system modules, configuration files, metadata, packages, services, and user sessions. The inventory page provides a real-time, filterable, searchable view into each host’s configuration. The inventory page not only provides you with the list of packages installed but also provides version information as well. Use this version information to know which packages to upgrade and which packages to replicate for your cloud migration. It also helps you track the dependencies between the software packages and configuration files. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Inventory: View the inventory page for details about your hosts and their configurations. You can also use the Inventory page to get a sense of what software or packages you no longer need, which is a great way to “clean up” your servers before you migrate to the cloud. 5. Uncover unknown applications and components Since anything can happen during an application’s lifecycle, like an application changing ownership, you may come across applications or component dependencies that you did not know about. If you discover any unknown dependencies, assess their relationship to other applications and components in your infrastructure to determine if they should be pulled into your migration plan. If you discover any applications or components while viewing service maps or while reviewing the inventory page, remember to instrument them before you migrate them. 6. Resolve errors or other issues After you instrument your applications, APM may uncover errors or issues with your current on-prem applications. Use APM error analytics to determine the root cause of any errors or issues in your applications. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors: Use error analytics to determine the root cause of errors in your applications. Start with the Error rate chart to see if there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or error patterns. Correlate any patterns on the Top 5 errors chart to alerts occurring during the same time period. The Error traces table includes specific stack trace details, such as associated host, user, framework code, and custom attributes to help you identify the root cause of an error. 7. Create Dashboards In addition to the application baselines you built, create dashboards to assess your on-premises applications in preparation for migrating them to the cloud. Use Dashboards to gain visibility into the average response times, the top transactions, the associated average duration, and the overall CPU usage for your instrumented application. Drill down into individual applications to see your top processes and the CPU percent for each process. You can also view an error analysis for a set of instrumented applications: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > (select a dashboard): View errors visualize issues with your applications. Check out the best practices guide for tips on creating and utilizing dashboards. Sharing New Relic Dashboards with your teams and stakeholders is a powerful way to communicate the impact of your migration during your cloud adoption process.

      "body": "As you migrate your applications to the cloud, you want to catch and correct any unexpected behavior or outcomes as soon as possible. Detecting errors and issues related to your new cloud architecture, performance, and scale is critical—getting the right information at the right time can be the difference between success and failure. 1. Identify components Create a list all of applications, services, and their underlying server infrastructures in your application portfolio that you want to migrate to the cloud. 2. Identify KPIs To provide quantifiable measures that your teams can use to assess your migration, identify a list of corporate KPIs (key performance indicators). Using the New Relic platform to measure KPIs helps you eliminate blindspots and see the connections between entities—from your application code, to your cloud infrastructure (including containers running in highly distributed microservices), to your customer experience. Your goal is to create a collection of metrics in several categories that you can visualize in our Dashboards. To validate cloud improvements, group KPIs in the following categories, from least to most strong: Application and infrastructure performance End-user experience, including website and mobile application performance Audience and content trends DevOps productivity Application revenue analytics Future business goals 3. Deploy monitoring tools To start monitoring your KPIs, verify that the applications that you want to migrate are compatible with the requirements for the New Relic products you will use. Then, install the New Relic agents: Deploy APM Review the compatibility and requirements and then install APM agents on your application stack. After installing the APM agents, review the architecture of the applications that you instrumented with an APM agent. Take note of all hosts that are part of each tier of the application stack (database, application, web server, etc.), so you can install infrastructure monitoring agents on each of those hosts. Deploy browser monitoring In a nutshell, browser monitoring is a snippet of JavaScript that needs to appear in all of your application's webpages. It has no dependencies on other libraries, so it does not cause additional delays when bringing jQuery or other frameworks into the webpage. There are three ways to install the browser agent: Method When to use this method Enable via APM Typically, the quickest path is to let the APM agent dynamically inject the snippet into your pages on the server side. This works for many common web technologies, such as .NET, JSP, and other Java solutions. The documentation provides a complete reference for the languages and frameworks that allow this option. Copy/paste method If you are using an unsupported framework or are in an environment where you can instrument only the webpages but cannot install APM on the backend, use the copy-paste method. The UI generates a simple JavaScript snippet. Copy that snippet, and paste it into a global page template on your end to get browser monitoring deployed across your site. Enable via the API You can perform a manual instrumentation, in which your developers add instrumentation to your webpages using a server-side API. New Relic supports this for many server-side languages. Refer to the documentation for an example of how to do this in Java. Deploy New Relic Infrastructure After reviewing the requirements for New Relic Infrastructure, install the Infrastructure agent on the hosts that you identified so you can start to gather data for your KPIs. Tip If you use Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for automation, you can use those tools to deploy Infrastructure agents to your hosts. Set up alerts New Relic Alerts is a single integrated solution with a centralized UI to help you focus on the metrics that you care about most. When you set up New Relic Alerts and NRQL alerting, you establish flexible policies and conditions to receive alerts and notifications on multiple channels (email, Slack, OpsGenie, etc.). For more detailed information about creating, managing, and using alerts, check out the New Relic University tutorials. 4. Set up cloud integrations Tip Cloud-based integrations available through New Relic include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. Once your applications are migrated to the cloud and you start to integrate new cloud services, you can use New Relic to monitor and report data about your cloud services, offering you a comprehensive view of your entire architecture in one place. For example, to capture and record AWS account activity for audit and governance purposes, use the New Relic AWS CloudTrail integration. Tracking error events gives you awareness about API calls and services that have failed, while console logins help you monitor console activity and potential intrusion attempts. New Relic collects this event data so you can display it in a Dashboard or alert on it with NRQL. To gain extended visibility into applications that your code depends on, you can also deploy on-host integrations for commonly used application components, such as MySQL, Apache, and NGINX. In addition, you can create your own custom on-host integration with the New Relic Integrations SDK. 5. Identify issues and roadblocks Once your applications are running in the cloud, they may generate new types of errors that are different from the errors that they generated when running on-premise. You can use New Relic APM and browser monitoring to view error events, error metrics, and detailed error traces for your applications. If an error or unhandled exception happens, the data appears on the JavaScript errors page and the APM Error analytics page. From these pages, you can quickly troubleshoot runtime errors. Then, further analyze errors by grouping them according to attributes, by filtering them, or by searching for keywords in the event data. Each unhandled exception generates a transaction error event in Insights, and the dashboards are updated in real-time. Event data is a record of a single event at a particular moment in time and consists of default attributes, like a timestamp, and an event type. You can also add custom attributes to provide more context. Tip Once you start capturing JavaScript errors as events in Insights, set up NRQL alerting so you can stay on top of your error data. Use the JavaScript errors page to get visibility into real-time user experience: one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors: Use the charts on this page to get visibility into the real-time user experience. Then, create a Dashboard that covers a longer period of time and aligns the error and unhandled exception data with your KPIs: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > Create a dashboard: Use dashboards to align the error and unhandled exception data with your KPIs. Expert tip for alerting on JavaScript errors To get notifications for error spikes that are different from known or common JavaScript errors, use the following NRQL query for browser-monitored: SELECT count(*) FROM JavaScriptError WHERE appName = '<BrowserAppName>' AND errorClass NOT IN ('<ErrorClass1>','<ErrorClass2>') Copy Replace <BrowserAppName> with the browser app name that you want to monitor with this alert. Replace <ErrorClass1> and <ErrorClass2> with the on-premise error class names that you do not want New Relic to alert you about. Set the threshold based on your alerting needs. Using this query, New Relic alerts you every time a JavaScript error occurs when it has an error class that is not normally reported.",

      "body": "When you are planning a migration to the cloud, it is important to analyze your current on-premise architecture and identify the scope of your migration. When you have a full understanding of your applications, your hosts, and their architecture, you reduce the possibility of missing dependencies during your migration. 1. Identify applications and components First, you need to determine the level of instrumentation that is possible or allowed within your organization. The deeper you instrument, the more visibility you gain into your applications. Then, address the scope of your cloud migration by answering the following questions and keeping track of your answers: What applications do I need to include in the migration? What are the dependencies of each application? What are the underlying services/inventory supporting these applications? 2. Install New Relic agents Based on your answers when you determined the scope of your cloud migration, verify that the applications that you want to migrate are compatible with New Relic products and install the agents: APM APM delivers data about your application's performance, providing information about app availability and external services so you can visualize your application dependencies. Confirm that your system meets the requirements for the APM agents that you want to install, and then install the APM agent on your application stack. Steps for installing APM agents vary based on language. Infrastructure Infrastructure monitoring provides flexible, dynamic server monitoring so you can inventory your hosts and their configuration settings. Confirm that your underlying infrastructure meets the requirements for infrastructure. Install the infrastructure agent on instances that host your applications. Infrastructure on-host integrations Infrastructure on-host integrations monitor the services that your code depends on. Install the on-host integrations for the services that you are using. 3. Visualize application dependencies with APM After you install the APM agent, use service maps to get a full view of your application’s architecture. Service maps allow you to identify any connections from applications to external services, web services, databases, or APIs. After creating a service map for the application that has dependencies that you want to explore, add an application node on the map. Then, begin to add connections to the map including databases, external services, third-party APIs, and even browser-monitored applications. New Relic pulls every node you add into the map, and you can watch the shape of your architecture emerge. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Service map: View a service map to see a visual overview of your system architecture and the health of entities. Based on the visibility into internal and external dependencies that the service map provides, you can create a migration plan that includes all aspects of an application’s ecosystem. 4. Inventory underlining instances with Infrastructure New Relic Infrastructure's inventory page gives you visibility into the software packages installed on your servers. Essentially, the inventory page displays detailed information about a system’s per-host configuration, including details about system modules, configuration files, metadata, packages, services, and user sessions. The inventory page provides a real-time, filterable, searchable view into each host’s configuration. The inventory page not only provides you with the list of packages installed but also provides version information as well. Use this version information to know which packages to upgrade and which packages to replicate for your cloud migration. It also helps you track the dependencies between the software packages and configuration files. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Inventory: View the inventory page for details about your hosts and their configurations. You can also use the Inventory page to get a sense of what software or packages you no longer need, which is a great way to “clean up” your servers before you migrate to the cloud. 5. Uncover unknown applications and components Since anything can happen during an application’s lifecycle, like an application changing ownership, you may come across applications or component dependencies that you did not know about. If you discover any unknown dependencies, assess their relationship to other applications and components in your infrastructure to determine if they should be pulled into your migration plan. If you discover any applications or components while viewing service maps or while reviewing the inventory page, remember to instrument them before you migrate them. 6. Resolve errors or other issues After you instrument your applications, APM may uncover errors or issues with your current on-prem applications. Use APM error analytics to determine the root cause of any errors or issues in your applications. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors: Use error analytics to determine the root cause of errors in your applications. Start with the Error rate chart to see if there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or error patterns. Correlate any patterns on the Top 5 errors chart to alerts occurring during the same time period. The Error traces table includes specific stack trace details, such as associated host, user, framework code, and custom attributes to help you identify the root cause of an error. 7. Create Dashboards In addition to the application baselines you built, create dashboards to assess your on-premises applications in preparation for migrating them to the cloud. Use Dashboards to gain visibility into the average response times, the top transactions, the associated average duration, and the overall CPU usage for your instrumented application. Drill down into individual applications to see your top processes and the CPU percent for each process. You can also view an error analysis for a set of instrumented applications: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > (select a dashboard): View errors visualize issues with your applications. Check out the best practices guide for tips on creating and utilizing dashboards. Sharing New Relic Dashboards with your teams and stakeholders is a powerful way to communicate the impact of your migration during your cloud adoption process.

New Relic offers cloud integrations for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform as well as on-host integrations. Tip If you are using AWS as a cloud provider, take advantage of New Relic’s AWS billing integrations to stay on top of your budget and prove the success of your migration. 3. Gather custom data To manage, search for, and filter resources, assign metadata to your cloud resources in the form of tags. Tags are labels that consist of key-value pairs that you use to annotate your Infrastructure data. Tag formats are different between AWS, Azure, and Google. Google, for example, has the shortest allowable lengths for keys and values. In addition, they all have different requirements for case sensitivity and allowable characters. To make sure that your tags are usable across most cloud providers: Use only lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes. Keep keys and values under 63 characters. New Relic reports data contained in specific events to your account as part of its “out-of-the-box” functionality. You can add additional data to those events by using custom attributes. If you determine that you need to collect custom data, review custom data requirements, and report custom event data. For more detailed information about sending custom data, check out these New Relic University tutorials: APM custom data overview Adding custom events using the API 4. Create baselines In order to validate the value of moving to the cloud, you need to get baselines for your applications before you move to the cloud. Define pre-migration baselines for applications and their underlying infrastructures that you have designated for cloud service improvements based on your KPIs. To stay on top of your KPIs as you are moving, create baseline alerts for applications monitored by APM and browser and use NRQL alerts to get notified on any spikes or drops in your KPIs. The following dashboard tracks key performance indicators for applications designated to move to the cloud: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > Create a dashboard: Create dashboards to track your KPIs. After you migrate applications to the cloud, apply the same criteria to post-migration baselines so you can compare your results from before and after your migration. 5. Validate improvements with Dashboards Dashboards is a single location to view all the data that New Relic products gather. Use New Relic Dashboards to visualize your KPIs before and after your move: Transaction and TransactionError event types with APM PageView and PageAction event types with browser Default Infrastructure events and attributes for your systems, processes, events, storage, and network, Infrastructure integrations, and custom attributes Mobile event types with Mobile SyntheticCheck, SyntheticRequest, and SyntheticPrivateMinion event types with Synthetics The following dashboard shows KPI data used to validate cloud improvements: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > Create a dashboard: Create dashboards to track your KPIs pre- and post-migration.

This works for many common web technologies, such as .NET, JSP, and other Java solutions. The documentation provides a complete reference for the languages and frameworks that allow this option. Copy/paste method If you are using an unsupported framework or are in an environment where you can instrument only the webpages but cannot install APM on the backend, use the copy-paste method. The UI generates a simple JavaScript snippet. Copy that snippet, and paste it into a global page template on your end to get browser monitoring deployed across your site. Enable via the API You can perform a manual instrumentation, in which your developers add instrumentation to your webpages using a server-side API. New Relic supports this for many server-side languages. Refer to the documentation for an example of how to do this in Java. Deploy New Relic Infrastructure After reviewing the requirements for New Relic Infrastructure, install the Infrastructure agent on the hosts that you identified so you can start to gather data for your KPIs. Tip If you use Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for automation, you can use those tools to deploy Infrastructure agents to your hosts. Set up alerts New Relic Alerts is a single integrated solution with a centralized UI to help you focus on the metrics that you care about most. When you set up New Relic Alerts and NRQL alerting, you establish flexible policies and conditions to receive alerts and notifications on multiple channels (email, Slack, OpsGenie, etc.). For more detailed information about creating, managing, and using alerts, check out the New Relic University tutorials. 4. Set up cloud integrations Tip Cloud-based integrations available through New Relic include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. Once your applications are migrated to the cloud and you start to integrate new cloud services, you can use New Relic to monitor and report data about your cloud services, offering you a comprehensive view of your entire architecture in one place. For example, to capture and record AWS account activity for audit and governance purposes, use the New Relic AWS CloudTrail integration. Tracking error events gives you awareness about API calls and services that have failed, while console logins help you monitor console activity and potential intrusion attempts. New Relic collects this event data so you can display it in a Dashboard or alert on it with NRQL. To gain extended visibility into applications that your code depends on, you can also deploy on-host integrations for commonly used application components, such as MySQL, Apache, and NGINX. In addition, you can create your own custom on-host integration with the New Relic Integrations SDK. 5. Identify issues and roadblocks Once your applications are running in the cloud, they may generate new types of errors that are different from the errors that they generated when running on-premise. You can use New Relic APM and browser monitoring to view error events, error metrics, and detailed error traces for your applications. If an error or unhandled exception happens, the data appears on the JavaScript errors page and the APM Error analytics page. From these pages, you can quickly troubleshoot runtime errors. Then, further analyze errors by grouping them according to attributes, by filtering them, or by searching for keywords in the event data. Each unhandled exception generates a transaction error event in Insights, and the dashboards are updated in real-time. Event data is a record of a single event at a particular moment in time and consists of default attributes, like a timestamp, and an event type. You can also add custom attributes to provide more context. Tip Once you start capturing JavaScript errors as events in Insights, set up NRQL alerting so you can stay on top of your error data. Use the JavaScript errors page to get visibility into real-time user experience: one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors: Use the charts on this page to get visibility into the real-time user experience. Then, create a Dashboard that covers a longer period of time and aligns the error and unhandled exception data with your KPIs: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > Create a dashboard: Use dashboards to align the error and unhandled exception data with your KPIs. Expert tip for alerting on JavaScript errors To get notifications for error spikes that are different from known or common JavaScript errors, use the following NRQL query for browser-monitored: SELECT count(*) FROM JavaScriptError WHERE appName = '<BrowserAppName>' AND errorClass NOT IN ('<ErrorClass1>','<ErrorClass2>') Copy Replace <BrowserAppName> with the browser app name that you want to monitor with this alert. Replace <ErrorClass1> and <ErrorClass2> with the on-premise error class names that you do not want New Relic to alert you about. Set the threshold based on your alerting needs. Using this query, New Relic alerts you every time a JavaScript error occurs when it has an error class that is not normally reported.",

      "body": "When you are planning a migration to the cloud, it is important to analyze your current on-premise architecture and identify the scope of your migration. When you have a full understanding of your applications, your hosts, and their architecture, you reduce the possibility of missing dependencies during your migration. 1. Identify applications and components First, you need to determine the level of instrumentation that is possible or allowed within your organization. The deeper you instrument, the more visibility you gain into your applications. Then, address the scope of your cloud migration by answering the following questions and keeping track of your answers: What applications do I need to include in the migration? What are the dependencies of each application? What are the underlying services/inventory supporting these applications? 2. Install New Relic agents Based on your answers when you determined the scope of your cloud migration, verify that the applications that you want to migrate are compatible with New Relic products and install the agents: APM APM delivers data about your application's performance, providing information about app availability and external services so you can visualize your application dependencies. Confirm that your system meets the requirements for the APM agents that you want to install, and then install the APM agent on your application stack. Steps for installing APM agents vary based on language. Infrastructure Infrastructure monitoring provides flexible, dynamic server monitoring so you can inventory your hosts and their configuration settings. Confirm that your underlying infrastructure meets the requirements for infrastructure. Install the infrastructure agent on instances that host your applications. Infrastructure on-host integrations Infrastructure on-host integrations monitor the services that your code depends on. Install the on-host integrations for the services that you are using. 3. Visualize application dependencies with APM After you install the APM agent, use service maps to get a full view of your application’s architecture. Service maps allow you to identify any connections from applications to external services, web services, databases, or APIs. After creating a service map for the application that has dependencies that you want to explore, add an application node on the map. Then, begin to add connections to the map including databases, external services, third-party APIs, and even browser-monitored applications. New Relic pulls every node you add into the map, and you can watch the shape of your architecture emerge. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Service map: View a service map to see a visual overview of your system architecture and the health of entities. Based on the visibility into internal and external dependencies that the service map provides, you can create a migration plan that includes all aspects of an application’s ecosystem. 4. Inventory underlining instances with Infrastructure New Relic Infrastructure's inventory page gives you visibility into the software packages installed on your servers. Essentially, the inventory page displays detailed information about a system’s per-host configuration, including details about system modules, configuration files, metadata, packages, services, and user sessions. The inventory page provides a real-time, filterable, searchable view into each host’s configuration. The inventory page not only provides you with the list of packages installed but also provides version information as well. Use this version information to know which packages to upgrade and which packages to replicate for your cloud migration. It also helps you track the dependencies between the software packages and configuration files. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Inventory: View the inventory page for details about your hosts and their configurations. You can also use the Inventory page to get a sense of what software or packages you no longer need, which is a great way to “clean up” your servers before you migrate to the cloud. 5. Uncover unknown applications and components Since anything can happen during an application’s lifecycle, like an application changing ownership, you may come across applications or component dependencies that you did not know about. If you discover any unknown dependencies, assess their relationship to other applications and components in your infrastructure to determine if they should be pulled into your migration plan. If you discover any applications or components while viewing service maps or while reviewing the inventory page, remember to instrument them before you migrate them. 6. Resolve errors or other issues After you instrument your applications, APM may uncover errors or issues with your current on-prem applications. Use APM error analytics to determine the root cause of any errors or issues in your applications. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors: Use error analytics to determine the root cause of errors in your applications. Start with the Error rate chart to see if there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or error patterns. Correlate any patterns on the Top 5 errors chart to alerts occurring during the same time period. The Error traces table includes specific stack trace details, such as associated host, user, framework code, and custom attributes to help you identify the root cause of an error. 7. Create Dashboards In addition to the application baselines you built, create dashboards to assess your on-premises applications in preparation for migrating them to the cloud. Use Dashboards to gain visibility into the average response times, the top transactions, the associated average duration, and the overall CPU usage for your instrumented application. Drill down into individual applications to see your top processes and the CPU percent for each process. You can also view an error analysis for a set of instrumented applications: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > (select a dashboard): View errors visualize issues with your applications. Check out the best practices guide for tips on creating and utilizing dashboards. Sharing New Relic Dashboards with your teams and stakeholders is a powerful way to communicate the impact of your migration during your cloud adoption process. Expert tip for reporting custom data Utilizing service maps, errors, and inventory management gives you a critical look at the architecture of your applications and their dependencies.

      "body": "After you migrate your applications to the cloud and integrate cloud services, use New Relic to measure and validate improvements to your applications. 1. Identify KPIs To provide quantifiable measures that your teams can use to assess your migration, identify a list of corporate KPIs (key performance indicators). Using the New Relic platform to measure KPIs helps you eliminate blind spots and see the connections between entities—from your application code to your cloud infrastructure (including containers running in highly distributed microservices), to your customer experience. Your goal is to create a collection of metrics in several categories that you can visualize in dashboards in New Relic Dashboards. To validate cloud improvements, group KPIs in the following categories, from least to most strong: Application and infrastructure performance End-user experience, including website and mobile application performance Audience and content trends DevOps productivity Application revenue analytics Future business goals 2. Deploy monitoring tools To start monitoring your KPIs, verify that the applications that you want to migrate are compatible with the requirements for the New Relic products you want to use. Then, install the New Relic agents: Install APM Review the compatibility and requirements and then install APM agents on your application stack. After installing the APM agents, review the architecture of the applications you instrumented with an APM agent. Take note of all hosts that are part of each tier of the application stack (database, application, web server, etc.), so you can install New Relic Infrastructure agents on each of those hosts. Install infrastructure After reviewing the requirements for New Relic Infrastructure, install the infrastructure agent on the hosts that you identified so you can start to gather data for your KPIs. Tip If you use Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for automation, you can use those tools to deploy Infrastructure agents to your hosts. Install infrastructure integrations You can also monitor and report data about services that your code depends on using New Relic integrations. New Relic offers cloud integrations for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform as well as on-host integrations. Tip If you are using AWS as a cloud provider, take advantage of New Relic’s AWS billing integrations to stay on top of your budget and prove the success of your migration. 3. Gather custom data To manage, search for, and filter resources, assign metadata to your cloud resources in the form of tags. Tags are labels that consist of key-value pairs that you use to annotate your Infrastructure data. Tag formats are different between AWS, Azure, and Google. Google, for example, has the shortest allowable lengths for keys and values. In addition, they all have different requirements for case sensitivity and allowable characters. To make sure that your tags are usable across most cloud providers: Use only lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes. Keep keys and values under 63 characters. New Relic reports data contained in specific events to your account as part of its “out-of-the-box” functionality. You can add additional data to those events by using custom attributes. If you determine that you need to collect custom data, review custom data requirements, and report custom event data. For more detailed information about sending custom data, check out these New Relic University tutorials: APM custom data overview Adding custom events using the API 4. Create baselines In order to validate the value of moving to the cloud, you need to get baselines for your applications before you move to the cloud. Define pre-migration baselines for applications and their underlying infrastructures that you have designated for cloud service improvements based on your KPIs. To stay on top of your KPIs as you are moving, create baseline alerts for applications monitored by APM and browser and use NRQL alerts to get notified on any spikes or drops in your KPIs. The following dashboard tracks key performance indicators for applications designated to move to the cloud: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > Create a dashboard: Create dashboards to track your KPIs. After you migrate applications to the cloud, apply the same criteria to post-migration baselines so you can compare your results from before and after your migration. 5. Validate improvements with Dashboards Dashboards is a single location to view all the data that New Relic products gather. Use New Relic Dashboards to visualize your KPIs before and after your move: Transaction and TransactionError event types with APM PageView and PageAction event types with browser Default Infrastructure events and attributes for your systems, processes, events, storage, and network, Infrastructure integrations, and custom attributes Mobile event types with Mobile SyntheticCheck, SyntheticRequest, and SyntheticPrivateMinion event types with Synthetics The following dashboard shows KPI data used to validate cloud improvements: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > Create a dashboard: Create dashboards to track your KPIs pre- and post-migration.

      "body": "When you are planning a migration to the cloud, it is important to analyze your current on-premise architecture and identify the scope of your migration. When you have a full understanding of your applications, your hosts, and their architecture, you reduce the possibility of missing dependencies during your migration. 1. Identify applications and components First, you need to determine the level of instrumentation that is possible or allowed within your organization. The deeper you instrument, the more visibility you gain into your applications. Then, address the scope of your cloud migration by answering the following questions and keeping track of your answers: What applications do I need to include in the migration? What are the dependencies of each application? What are the underlying services/inventory supporting these applications? 2. Install New Relic agents Based on your answers when you determined the scope of your cloud migration, verify that the applications that you want to migrate are compatible with New Relic products and install the agents: APM APM delivers data about your application's performance, providing information about app availability and external services so you can visualize your application dependencies. Confirm that your system meets the requirements for the APM agents that you want to install, and then install the APM agent on your application stack. Steps for installing APM agents vary based on language. Infrastructure Infrastructure monitoring provides flexible, dynamic server monitoring so you can inventory your hosts and their configuration settings. Confirm that your underlying infrastructure meets the requirements for infrastructure. Install the infrastructure agent on instances that host your applications. Infrastructure on-host integrations Infrastructure on-host integrations monitor the services that your code depends on. Install the on-host integrations for the services that you are using. 3. Visualize application dependencies with APM After you install the APM agent, use service maps to get a full view of your application’s architecture. Service maps allow you to identify any connections from applications to external services, web services, databases, or APIs. After creating a service map for the application that has dependencies that you want to explore, add an application node on the map. Then, begin to add connections to the map including databases, external services, third-party APIs, and even browser-monitored applications. New Relic pulls every node you add into the map, and you can watch the shape of your architecture emerge. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an application) > Service map: View a service map to see a visual overview of your system architecture and the health of entities. Based on the visibility into internal and external dependencies that the service map provides, you can create a migration plan that includes all aspects of an application’s ecosystem. 4. Inventory underlining instances with Infrastructure New Relic Infrastructure's inventory page gives you visibility into the software packages installed on your servers. Essentially, the inventory page displays detailed information about a system’s per-host configuration, including details about system modules, configuration files, metadata, packages, services, and user sessions. The inventory page provides a real-time, filterable, searchable view into each host’s configuration. The inventory page not only provides you with the list of packages installed but also provides version information as well. Use this version information to know which packages to upgrade and which packages to replicate for your cloud migration. It also helps you track the dependencies between the software packages and configuration files. one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Inventory: View the inventory page for details about your hosts and their configurations. You can also use the Inventory page to get a sense of what software or packages you no longer need, which is a great way to “clean up” your servers before you migrate to the cloud. 5. Uncover unknown applications and components Since anything can happen during an application’s lifecycle, like an application changing ownership, you may come across applications or component dependencies that you did not know about. If you discover any unknown dependencies, assess their relationship to other applications and components in your infrastructure to determine if they should be pulled into your migration plan. If you discover any applications or components while viewing service maps or while reviewing the inventory page, remember to instrument them before you migrate them. 6. Resolve errors or other issues After you instrument your applications, APM may uncover errors or issues with your current on-prem applications. Use APM error analytics to determine the root cause of any errors or issues in your applications. one.newrelic.com > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors: Use error analytics to determine the root cause of errors in your applications. Start with the Error rate chart to see if there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or error patterns. Correlate any patterns on the Top 5 errors chart to alerts occurring during the same time period. The Error traces table includes specific stack trace details, such as associated host, user, framework code, and custom attributes to help you identify the root cause of an error. 7. Create Dashboards In addition to the application baselines you built, create dashboards to assess your on-premises applications in preparation for migrating them to the cloud. Use Dashboards to gain visibility into the average response times, the top transactions, the associated average duration, and the overall CPU usage for your instrumented application. Drill down into individual applications to see your top processes and the CPU percent for each process. You can also view an error analysis for a set of instrumented applications: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > (select a dashboard): View errors visualize issues with your applications. Check out the best practices guide for tips on creating and utilizing dashboards. Sharing New Relic Dashboards with your teams and stakeholders is a powerful way to communicate the impact of your migration during your cloud adoption process. Expert tip for reporting custom data Utilizing service maps, errors, and inventory management gives you a critical look at the architecture of your applications and their dependencies.

      "body": "After you migrate your applications to the cloud and integrate cloud services, use New Relic to measure and validate improvements to your applications. 1. Identify KPIs To provide quantifiable measures that your teams can use to assess your migration, identify a list of corporate KPIs (key performance indicators). Using the New Relic platform to measure KPIs helps you eliminate blind spots and see the connections between entities—from your application code to your cloud infrastructure (including containers running in highly distributed microservices), to your customer experience. Your goal is to create a collection of metrics in several categories that you can visualize in dashboards in New Relic Dashboards. To validate cloud improvements, group KPIs in the following categories, from least to most strong: Application and infrastructure performance End-user experience, including website and mobile application performance Audience and content trends DevOps productivity Application revenue analytics Future business goals 2. Deploy monitoring tools To start monitoring your KPIs, verify that the applications that you want to migrate are compatible with the requirements for the New Relic products you want to use. Then, install the New Relic agents: Install APM Review the compatibility and requirements and then install APM agents on your application stack. After installing the APM agents, review the architecture of the applications you instrumented with an APM agent. Take note of all hosts that are part of each tier of the application stack (database, application, web server, etc.), so you can install New Relic Infrastructure agents on each of those hosts. Install infrastructure After reviewing the requirements for New Relic Infrastructure, install the infrastructure agent on the hosts that you identified so you can start to gather data for your KPIs. Tip If you use Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for automation, you can use those tools to deploy Infrastructure agents to your hosts. Install infrastructure integrations You can also monitor and report data about services that your code depends on using New Relic integrations. New Relic offers cloud integrations for Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform as well as on-host integrations. Tip If you are using AWS as a cloud provider, take advantage of New Relic’s AWS billing integrations to stay on top of your budget and prove the success of your migration. 3. Gather custom data To manage, search for, and filter resources, assign metadata to your cloud resources in the form of tags. Tags are labels that consist of key-value pairs that you use to annotate your Infrastructure data. Tag formats are different between AWS, Azure, and Google. Google, for example, has the shortest allowable lengths for keys and values. In addition, they all have different requirements for case sensitivity and allowable characters. To make sure that your tags are usable across most cloud providers: Use only lowercase letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes. Keep keys and values under 63 characters. New Relic reports data contained in specific events to your account as part of its “out-of-the-box” functionality. You can add additional data to those events by using custom attributes. If you determine that you need to collect custom data, review custom data requirements, and report custom event data. For more detailed information about sending custom data, check out these New Relic University tutorials: APM custom data overview Adding custom events using the API 4. Create baselines In order to validate the value of moving to the cloud, you need to get baselines for your applications before you move to the cloud. Define pre-migration baselines for applications and their underlying infrastructures that you have designated for cloud service improvements based on your KPIs. To stay on top of your KPIs as you are moving, create baseline alerts for applications monitored by APM and browser and use NRQL alerts to get notified on any spikes or drops in your KPIs. The following dashboard tracks key performance indicators for applications designated to move to the cloud: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > Create a dashboard: Create dashboards to track your KPIs. After you migrate applications to the cloud, apply the same criteria to post-migration baselines so you can compare your results from before and after your migration. 5. Validate improvements with Dashboards Dashboards is a single location to view all the data that New Relic products gather. Use New Relic Dashboards to visualize your KPIs before and after your move: Transaction and TransactionError event types with APM PageView and PageAction event types with browser Default Infrastructure events and attributes for your systems, processes, events, storage, and network, Infrastructure integrations, and custom attributes Mobile event types with Mobile SyntheticCheck, SyntheticRequest, and SyntheticPrivateMinion event types with Synthetics The following dashboard shows KPI data used to validate cloud improvements: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > Create a dashboard: Create dashboards to track your KPIs pre- and post-migration.

Identify components Create a list all of applications, services, and their underlying server infrastructures in your application portfolio that you want to migrate to the cloud. 2. Identify KPIs To provide quantifiable measures that your teams can use to assess your migration, identify a list of corporate KPIs (key performance indicators).

After installing the APM agents, review the architecture of the applications that you instrumented with an APM agent. Take note of all hosts that are part of each tier of the application stack (database, application, web server, etc.), so you can install infrastructure monitoring agents on each of those hosts. Deploy browser monitoring In a nutshell, browser monitoring is a snippet of JavaScript that needs to appear in all of your application's webpages. It has no dependencies on other libraries, so it does not cause additional delays when bringing jQuery or other frameworks into the webpage. There are three ways to install the browser agent: Method When to use this method Enable via APM Typically, the quickest path is to let the APM agent dynamically inject the snippet into your pages on the server side. This works for many common web technologies, such as .NET, JSP, and other Java solutions. The documentation provides a complete reference for the languages and frameworks that allow this option. Copy/paste method If you are using an unsupported framework or are in an environment where you can instrument only the webpages but cannot install APM on the backend, use the copy-paste method. The UI generates a simple JavaScript snippet. Copy that snippet, and paste it into a global page template on your end to get browser monitoring deployed across your site. Enable via the API You can perform a manual instrumentation, in which your developers add instrumentation to your webpages using a server-side API. New Relic supports this for many server-side languages. Refer to the documentation for an example of how to do this in Java. Deploy New Relic Infrastructure After reviewing the requirements for New Relic Infrastructure, install the Infrastructure agent on the hosts that you identified so you can start to gather data for your KPIs. Tip If you use Ansible, Chef, or Puppet for automation, you can use those tools to deploy Infrastructure agents to your hosts. Set up alerts New Relic Alerts is a single integrated solution with a centralized UI to help you focus on the metrics that you care about most. When you set up New Relic Alerts and NRQL alerting, you establish flexible policies and conditions to receive alerts and notifications on multiple channels (email, Slack, OpsGenie, etc.). For more detailed information about creating, managing, and using alerts, check out the New Relic University tutorials. 4. Set up cloud integrations Tip Cloud-based integrations available through New Relic include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. Once your applications are migrated to the cloud and you start to integrate new cloud services, you can use New Relic to monitor and report data about your cloud services, offering you a comprehensive view of your entire architecture in one place. For example, to capture and record AWS account activity for audit and governance purposes, use the New Relic AWS CloudTrail integration. Tracking error events gives you awareness about API calls and services that have failed, while console logins help you monitor console activity and potential intrusion attempts. New Relic collects this event data so you can display it in a Dashboard or alert on it with NRQL. To gain extended visibility into applications that your code depends on, you can also deploy on-host integrations for commonly used application components, such as MySQL, Apache, and NGINX. In addition, you can create your own custom on-host integration with the New Relic Integrations SDK. 5. Identify issues and roadblocks Once your applications are running in the cloud, they may generate new types of errors that are different from the errors that they generated when running on-premise. You can use New Relic APM and browser monitoring to view error events, error metrics, and detailed error traces for your applications. If an error or unhandled exception happens, the data appears on the JavaScript errors page and the APM Error analytics page. From these pages, you can quickly troubleshoot runtime errors. Then, further analyze errors by grouping them according to attributes, by filtering them, or by searching for keywords in the event data. Each unhandled exception generates a transaction error event in Insights, and the dashboards are updated in real-time. Event data is a record of a single event at a particular moment in time and consists of default attributes, like a timestamp, and an event type. You can also add custom attributes to provide more context. Tip Once you start capturing JavaScript errors as events in Insights, set up NRQL alerting so you can stay on top of your error data. Use the JavaScript errors page to get visibility into real-time user experience: one.newrelic.com > Browser > (select an app) > JS errors: Use the charts on this page to get visibility into the real-time user experience. Then, create a Dashboard that covers a longer period of time and aligns the error and unhandled exception data with your KPIs: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > Create a dashboard: Use dashboards to align the error and unhandled exception data with your KPIs. Expert tip for alerting on JavaScript errors To get notifications for error spikes that are different from known or common JavaScript errors, use the following NRQL query for browser-monitored: SELECT count(*) FROM JavaScriptError WHERE appName = '<BrowserAppName>' AND errorClass NOT IN ('<ErrorClass1>','<ErrorClass2>') Copy Replace <BrowserAppName> with the browser app name that you want to monitor with this alert. Replace <ErrorClass1> and <ErrorClass2> with the on-premise error class names that you do not want New Relic to alert you about. Set the threshold based on your alerting needs. Using this query, New Relic alerts you every time a JavaScript error occurs when it has an error class that is not normally reported.",

Create Dashboards In addition to the application baselines you built, create dashboards to assess your on-premises applications in preparation for migrating them to the cloud. Use Dashboards to gain visibility into the average response times, the top transactions, the associated average duration, and the overall CPU usage for your instrumented application. Drill down into individual applications to see your top processes and the CPU percent for each process. You can also view an error analysis for a set of instrumented applications: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards > (select a dashboard): View errors visualize issues with your applications. Check out the best practices guide for tips on creating and utilizing dashboards. Sharing New Relic Dashboards with your teams and stakeholders is a powerful way to communicate the impact of your migration during your cloud adoption process.

      "body": "Cloud migrations can take many forms. Some companies choose to port their applications directly from their data center to the cloud (a “Lift and Shift” migration) while others focus on completely re-architecting their applications to take advantage of benefits available only in the cloud. No matter your approach, there are three primary questions you want to answer after your migration: Has my application gotten slower? Is my application less stable than before? Am I losing customers due to either of the previous questions? To answer these questions, start by performing some basic testing to establish a baseline for the performance and availability of your systems. A baseline is a measurement of the current performance and availability of your application, which you then use as a comparison after your migration to validate your business case. In some cases, you may change a baseline when you perform migration acceptance testing. You can also use a baseline as a comparison point during your migration to make sure that you are on track. 1. Identify components Before you begin a cloud migration, identify all the tiers of your entire application stack. List all of the components (applications, services, etc.) that you want to migrate. Segment the application stack as follows: Application (backend/microservices/cron jobs) Dependency services, such as the message queue Database Website Underlying server and infrastructure Tip Make sure that you have access to applications and instances before you start creating application baselines. Engage your application owners, DevOps engineers, and product managers for access. Example: List of components Here is an example of the list of components in an application stack: Component Name Owner Language Stack Accessibility (Internet, Intranet) Operating System Service 1 John Doe Java Internet RHEL 6 Service 2 Maya Wiz .NET Intranet Win2003 R2 RabbitMQ John Doe Java Intranet AIX Website Maya Wiz Classic ASP Internet Win2000 MS SQL Dave Z NA Intranet Win2003 R2 2. Determine compatibility Once you identify the applications that you want to migrate, it is time to verify which application tiers to monitor with the New Relic platform. Work with stakeholders in your organization to determine the amount of instrumentation that is possible–or allowed–within your organization. This is an important step and one that will pay off, as the more you can instrument, the better your baselines. Here are the New Relic products to use for baselining, depending on the components that you identified: APM: Monitor your web apps with APM. See Compatibility and requirements for New Relic agents and products to learn precise compatibility details for each supported language. Infrastructure: Monitor your hosts with infrastructure. See Compatibility and requirements for infrastructure for supported operating systems and environments. You can also instrument other products and services with on-host integrations. Synthetics: Monitor web frontends and APIs with synthetics. Sometimes, you may not be able to instrument your on-premise environment with APM or Infrastructure. For example, maybe your organization's policy forbids installing an agent behind a firewall. In these cases, if the application has a web frontend, use Synthetics, as it offers non-agent monitoring while still providing the ability to establish a baseline. Example: Components matched to New Relic products Match the components that you identified with their corresponding products: Component Name Tier Owner Language Stack Accessibility (Internet/ Intranet) Operating System New Relic Products Service 1 John Doe Java Internet RHEL 6 APM, Infrastructure, Synthetics Service 2 Maya Wiz .NET Intranet Win2003 R2 APM, Infrastructure ActiveMQ John Doe Java Intranet AIX APM, Plugin Website Maya Wiz Classic ASP Internet Win2000 Synthetics MS SQL Dave Z n/a Intranet Win2003 R2 Infrastructure, On-host Integration 3. Deploy monitoring Based on the component-product matches you made, deploy agents or monitors across your architecture: Deploy APM Install the APM agent on your application stack. The steps to install the APM agent are different based on language. Deploy New Relic Infrastructure After reviewing the requirements for infrastructure, follow the instructions to install the infrastructure agent on your hosts: Install for Linux Install for Windows Server Install on AWS Elastic Beanstalk Install with a configuration management tool Deploy Infrastructure on-host integrations To gain extended visibility into applications that your code depends on, deploy on-host integrations. Available integrations include Apache, MySQL, NGINX, and others. Create New Relic Synthetics monitors New Relic Synthetics is a suite of automated, scriptable tools to monitor your websites, critical business transactions, and API endpoints. To get started add a monitor. Tip Make sure to verify that your website URL is accessible from the public network. You may also need to add New Relic IPs to your allow list. 4. Gather metrics After you deploy the agents and monitors, identify which metrics are the most important to your business and use these metrics to define your KPIs. Some recommendations include: Response time: Time taken to respond to a request. Throughput: Number of requests that came in through the application. Requesting queuing (Apache, IIS, NGINX): Duration of time taken for a request to reach your application. Database call duration: Duration of time taken to complete a database call. DB call counts: Number of calls made by application code to the database. Error rate: Percent of errors reported. Apdex score: An industry standard to measure user satisfaction with the response time of web applications and services. DNS setup timing: The time it takes to connect and receive data from DNS. SSL setup timing: The time it takes to establish an SSL connection. You can find some of these metrics in service maps, as well as on APM, and [browser] (/docs/ /new-relic-browser/getting-started/browser-overview-page-website-performance-summary) overview pages. For more detailed information about navigating, interpreting, and using APM, check out these New Relic University’s tutorials: Overview dashboard tour Transactions dashboard Understanding Apdex 5. Set up Dashboards After you define your KPIs, it is easy to visualize them in dashboards. Dashboards provide a single location to view all the data that New Relic products gather. Dashboards data consists of events, and each event has an event type, a timestamp, and key-value attributes. For more information about events, see Data collection and Default events for New Relic products. You can locate your KPIs and business metrics data in New Relic using the data explorer and the NRQL query language. You can also build dashboards to track the performance of those KPIs: Example: Component performance compared against baselines Continuing the examples in this document, the following table illustrates the maturity of your application performance over a period of time based on deployment milestones. Each milestone will serve as a new baseline for your applications: Component Milestone 1 Milestone 2 Milestone N Environment Component Name Response Time SLA Apdex Response Time SLA Apdex Response On-Prem Service 1 1.5 secs 80% 70% 1.5 secs 68% 0.65 1.4 secs Cloud Service 1 0.9 secs 96.8% 95% 0.9 secs 98% 0.99 0.7 secs On-Prem Service 2 0.7 secs 73% 68% 0.7 secs 80% 0.78 0.85 secs Cloud Service 2 0.6 secs 90% 92% 0.6 secs 89% 0.90 0.5 secs After your migration, compare these baselines against your migration acceptance testing baselines. Expert tips If you find that you need data that is not captured by default instrumentation, New Relic makes it easy to capture custom data: APM custom instrumentation Browser custom data Infrastructure custom attributes Custom event data Mobile custom data Synthetics custom attributes You can also learn more about APM custom instrumentation with the New Relic University Custom data tutorial series.",

      "body": "Overview Digital customer experience is your end user’s experience across all your digital touch points. There are four core factors that impact a user’s experience: Availability (Is it reachable?) Performance (Does it perform well enough to be usable?) Content quality (Does it have what users need and can they find it?) Product and content relevance (Does it have what users care about?) Digital customer experience includes web, mobile, and IoT. The first version of this guide is focused on measuring the end user web experience. Quality Foundation is about creating a standard practice to help you understand your digital customer experience in a meaningful way. Desired Outcome This implementation guide will help you: Look at customer experience in relation to: Global functions, such as search and login Lines of business Regions Report back to business stakeholders on what they care about Prioritize what you work on Create a repeatable practice Key Performance Indicators Quality Foundation measures the following KPIs: JavaScript error rate KPI This KPI measures the number of JavaScript errors per page view. Goal: Remove irrelevant JavaScript errors being tracked either by tuning ingest or using filtering. Reduce JavaScript errors that impact customer performance. HTTP error rate KPI HTTP errors (or HTTP 4xx and 5xx responses) happen when calls to the backend are not successful. Goal: Measure and reduce the HTTP error rate to ensure your customers are able to do what they came to your site to do. Time to first byte KPI This KPI measures the time from navigation start (a user clicking a link) to the browser receiving the first byte of the response from the server. Goal: Reduce the time to first byte by improving CDN, network, and service performance. Core web vitals: Largest contentful paint (LCP) KPI Core Web Vitals are part of Google’s Page Experience Metrics. They measure the experience from when a page begins rendering. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) measures the time it takes to load the largest image after a user has navigated to a new page. Goal: Reduce LCP to 2.5 seconds or better for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Reduce FID to 100 milliseconds or better for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Core web vitals: First input delay (FID) KPI This KPI measures the experience from when a page begins rendering. Goal: Reduce FID to 100 milliseconds or better for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Cumulative layout shift (CLS) KPI This KPI measures how much the page layout shifts during render. Goal: Maintain a score of 0.1 or less for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Prerequisites Required knowledge Familiarity with synthetic monitoring Familiarity with browser monitoring Familiarity with basic Browser UI views Familiarity with SPA data in Browser UI Required Installation and Configuration Browser Pro installed in all pages SPA enabled for single page applications Synthetics monitors configured: Ping monitors configured for anonymous users Scripted synthetics check configured for login flow Monitors should be configured to test from all regions applicable to your users Monitors should be configured for each domain and each login flow Data retention for browser events is at least 2x an average sprint. Establish current state Review Instrumented Pages Review Browser apps and pages to make sure that everything you expect to report back to New Relic is. You can do this by reviewing the Page Views tab in the Browser UI or running the following query: SELECT uniques(pageUrl) from PageView LIMIT MAX Copy You may need to filter out URLs that contain request or customer ID. Validate Browser URL Grouping Ensure Browser segments are captured correctly so user experience performance is measurable in both the NewRelic UI as well as at the aggregate level when querying via NRQL. A segment is the text between two / in a URL or between . of a domain name. For example, in the URL website.com/product/widget-name, the segments are: website .com product widget-name When there are a lot of URLs with a lot of segments, URLs can get crushed, so that website.com/product/widget-name becomes website.com/ or website.com/product/. In this example, the first crushed URL is not particularly useful, but the second one may be a useful way of aggregating customer experience data for the product. Not sure whether you need to tune your configuration? Import the Segment Allow List Investigation dashboard in GitHub to help. Once you’ve identified which segments to add, you can add them using Segment allow lists in Browser. Understand How You Will Segment Your Data Make Customer Experience data understandable and actionable by breaking it out into different segments. In this case, segments refer to groups of data. It does not refer to sections of URLs, as in segment allow lists. Consider the following statements: Most of our users experience 3 seconds or better to first input delay. On average, we see 2 seconds to the largest contentful paint. Last week, there were 1 million page views. Compared to: Most of the users in the US, Canada, and EMEA experience 2 seconds or better to first input delay. Malaysia and Indonesia users experience 4 seconds; we are looking into this. Customers buying car insurance typically see 1 second to largest contentful paint. For home insurance, it’s 4 seconds. Last week, there were 700,000 page views on mobile browser apps compared to 300,000 on desktop. Let’s make sure we’re optimizing our mobile experience. Typical segmentation involves breaking down user experience into the following categories: Segment Guidance Region/Location Basic: Group by country. Browser events automatically contain the country code of requests, so there is nothing you need to do to break it out further. Advanced: Make regional grouping match regional SLO groups by creating your own region attribute using custom attributes in Browser. Facet by countryCode. Related attributes: regionCode city asnLatitude asnLongitude Device Break out performance and engagement device type so you can understand: Typical breakdown of desktop vs mobile browser users Experience of desktop vs mobile browser users Facet by deviceType. Related attributes: userAgentName userAgentOS userAgentVersion Product/Line of Business In this scenario, a product is a separate line of business or service provided by your organization. Some examples of industries and respective products: An insurance company that sells both car and house insurance A media company that has multiple streaming services or channels A travel company that provides car rental as well as hotel bookings Basic: Break out performance by product by: Faceting on pageUrl: Use this approach when multiple products are grouped into one browser app in New Relic. Faceting by appName: Use this approach when each product is instrumented as a separate web app. Grouping by appName and then facet: Use this approach when there are multiple apps in browser supporting one product. Advanced: Add product offering as a custom attribute to browser pages using custom attributes. Environment During instrumentation or afterwards, follow a naming convention that specifies the environment in Browser. Well named browser apps specify product and/or function as well as environment. Examples: account-management.prod hotels-book.prod car-insurance.uat Using app naming conventions to specify the environment supports filtering data in both the UI and in dashboards. For more information, see the documentation for how to rename Browser apps. Team In some organizations, a single team supports multiple products, while in others, a product is big enough to be supported by multiple teams. Report on team performance against customer experience or engagement by either adding the team name to the Browser app name (for example, account-management.prod.unicorn-squad) or by using custom attributes. Import the Quality Foundation Dashboard This step creates the dashboard that you will use to measure your customer experience and improve it. Clone the GitHub repository. Follow the GitHub repository README instructions to implement the dashboard. Make sure to align the dashboard to lines of business or customer facing offerings rather than teams. This ensures optimization time is spent where it is most impactful. Capture Current Performance For Each Dashboard Page Follow the GitHub README instructions. Use the dashboard from the previous step to understand the overall performance for each line of business. If relevant, apply filters to see performance across region or device. If values drop below targets and it matters, add it to the sheet as a candidate for improvement. Not worth tracking: A company that sells insurance in the US only notices poor performance in Malaysia. Worth tracking: A company that sells insurance in the US only notices poor performance with respect to mobile users in the US. Improvement Process Plan your work Whether you have a dedicated initiative to improve performance or classifying as ongoing maintenance, you need to track your progress at the end of every sprint. Decide which KPIs to Improve You now know what your user experience looks like across multiple lines of business. Where should you be improving? Start with business priorities. If you have clear business directives or have access to a senior manager above who does, you should focus on what matters most to your organization. For example, let’s say your company has recently launched a new initiative around a line of business but the KPIs associated with the UI are below target. This is where you should focus time initially. Next, focus on KPIs for each line of business. Finally, filter each line of business by device, region, etc., to see if additional focus is needed for specific regions or devices. Improve Targeted KPIs To track your progress, create a new dashboard or add a new page to the existing dashboard and name it Quality Foundation KPI Improvement. For more information, see Improve Web Uptime. Improve Page Load Performance Narrow your focus to specific pages that aren’t meeting target KPI values. For each page load KPI result that is out of bounds in the Quality Foundation Dashboard, remove the COMPARE WITH clause and add FACET pageUrl/targetGroupedUrl LIMIT MAX to find which pages are the poor performers. Use targetGroupedUrl when there are many results; for example, when the customer ID is part of the URL. Otherwise, use pageUrl. Original Dashboard query: FROM PageViewTiming SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) WHERE appName ='WebPortal' AND pageUrl LIKE '%phone%' SINCE 1 week AGO COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO Copy New query to identify problem pages: FROM PageViewTiming SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) WHERE appName ='WebPortal' AND pageUrl LIKE '%phone%' FACET targetGroupedUrl LIMIT MAX Copy Once you have identified which pages to improve, improve them following these best practices. Improve AJAX Response Times Find the slow requests. Go to the Ajax duration widget on the dashboard. View query, then open in query builder. Add facet requestUrl LIMIT MAX to the end of the query. Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - AjaxResponseTimes. Focus improving requests with a timeToSettle > 2.5s. Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to improve response times. See AJAX troubleshooting tips. Improve the AJAX Error Rate Find the failing requests. Go to Dashboards > Query builder. Enter FROM AjaxRequest SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode >= 400) WHERE httpResponseCode >= 200 AND <Ajax Request filter> SINCE 1 week AGO facet pageUrl, appName Copy Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - Pages with AjaxErrors. Run the query again for the most problematic pages to find the requests that are failing: FROM AjaxRequest SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode >= 400) WHERE httpResponseCode >= 200 AND pageUrl=<problematic page> AND appName = <corresponding app> <Ajax Request filter> SINCE 1 week AGO facet requestUrl Copy Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to improve response times. See AJAX troubleshooting tips. Improve Javascript Errors Find the most common failures. Go to Dashboards > Query builder Enter FROM JavaScriptError SELECT count(errorClass) SINCE 1 week AGO WHERE <PageView filter> FACET transactionName, errorClass, errorMessage, domain Copy Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - Javascript Errors. Use this information to figure out which errors need to be addressed Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to resolve errors that need addressing. See JavaScript errors page: Detect and analyze errors. Remove third party errors that do not add value. You may be using a third party JavaScript that is noisy but works as expected. You can take a couple of approaches: Remove the domain name from the JavaScript error/Pageview ratio widget and add it as its own widget so you can see unexpected changes. You can alert on this using Baseline NRQL alerts. Drop the JavaScript error using drop filters. Only use this option if the volume of errors is impacting your data ingest in a significant way. Be as specific as you can in the drop filter. Conclusion Best practices going forward: Revisit performance metrics (shared in this document as Quality Foundation KPIs) at the end of each sprint. Incorporate performance improvements into developer sprints. Openly share metrics with the lines of the business you support as well as other internal stakeholders. Define Customer Experience SLOs. Create alerts for business critical drops in Quality Foundation KPIs. Value Realization: At the end of this process you should now: Have an understanding of your end user experience in a way that is tangible, actionable, and easy for engineers as well as the business to understand. Know how releases impact your end customers. Know how your customers are impacted by service, infrastructure, or network level events. See latency issues caused by backend services if they exist. Have created, or be on the path to create, a common language with business owners so you are working together. This can open new avenues for recognition and sponsorship for new projects.",

      "body": "Steps to follow to improve web uptime: 1. Investigate Synthetics checks Investigate and resolve failed Synthetics checks when they occur. Check multiple locations. Set up an alert to notify you when multiple locations fail. 2. Create workloads Create workloads that correlate synthetic monitors with browser applications, services, and infrastructure. Include a link to the workload in the alert runbook. You can also find the correlated workload for a synthetic using global search. Make sure that alerts are configured for each tier of your workload. This way you can see the health of each of the tiers in one view. This will save you time in troubleshooting. You do not need to create alert notifications for each tier to benefit from this view. 3. Investigate outages at lowest tier first When an outage occurs, start investigating at the lowest tier that is alerting.

In order to improve the overall performance and user experience, it helps to understand the different metrics and how they relate to each other. Before following the guidance below, narrow your scope to specific pages that you are trying to improve. For maximum impact, focus on pages that are frequently accessed but have a lower than accepted score for the 75th percentile of users. Page Load KPI How to improve time to first byte (TTFB): Time to first byte measures the time from navigation start (a user clicking a link) to the browser receiving the first byte of the response from the server. If users in the 75th percentile are experiencing a TTFB of greater than 0.5s for one or more of your pages, you can break timings down further by querying the following attributes in PageView: backendDuration connectionSetupDuration dnsLookupDuration networkDuration Frequently slowness prior to rendering is caused by slowness in the backend, either from third party APIs or backend applications. Synthetics monitoring for third party APIs helps operations and development teams understand when the root cause is outside of their control. Even if you cannot control the code, you can influence the outcome by sharing synthetics results with the third party to help them understand what your customers are experiencing. If the backend applications are owned by you or your team, you can use APM agents, Pixie, or OpenTelemetry to understand and manage performance. To make cross team communication easier, we recommend implementing Service Level Management boundaries. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) Cumulative layout shift is a score that indicates how much content shifts once it has already loaded. General tips and tricks for improving CLS: Specify dimensions for stylesheets and let the browser’s default CSS control the aspect ratio. Statically reserve space for ad slots. Avoid ads near the top of the viewport. Avoid inserting new content above existing content. Precompute sufficient space for embeds. Additional resources: Google’s approach to CLS optimization Lighthouse is a tool by Google that runs a synthetic test against a specific page and provides a list of recommendations that include how to optimize CLS. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) Largest contentful paint measures the difference between the start of page render until the time to paint the largest content element. Common causes for a slow lcp, according to web.dev: Slow server response times Render-blocking JavaScript and CSS Slow resource load times Client-side rendering Use Browser session trace information to understand which of the common causes above factor into the particular page you are trying to optimize. Approaches to improve LCP: Making use of CDNs and paying attention to caching and edge server performance Establishing third party connections early Delaying non-critical Javascript and CSS Additional resources: Google’s approach to LCP optimization Lighthouse is a tool by Google that runs a synthetic test against a specific page and provides a list of recommendations that include how to optimize CLS. First Input Delay (FID) First input delay is the time between when a user first interacts with a page to the time when the browser is able to respond. It’s a field metric that varies based on real user behavior (results vary based on user impatience and action timing) but can be optimized by reducing TBT, total blocking time. To do this, you need to: Break up long blocking tasks. Optimize bloated JavaScript. Look at moving logic server side and/or use web workers to run threads in the background. Use Browser session trace information to understand where your blocking intervals are occurring and for how long they last.

      "body": "Overview Digital customer experience is your end user’s experience across all your digital touch points. There are four core factors that impact a user’s experience: Availability (Is it reachable?) Performance (Does it perform well enough to be usable?) Content quality (Does it have what users need and can they find it?) Product and content relevance (Does it have what users care about?) Digital customer experience includes web, mobile, and IoT. The first version of this guide is focused on measuring the end user web experience. Quality Foundation is about creating a standard practice to help you understand your digital customer experience in a meaningful way. Desired Outcome This implementation guide will help you: Look at customer experience in relation to: Global functions, such as search and login Lines of business Regions Report back to business stakeholders on what they care about Prioritize what you work on Create a repeatable practice Key Performance Indicators Quality Foundation measures the following KPIs: JavaScript error rate KPI This KPI measures the number of JavaScript errors per page view. Goal: Remove irrelevant JavaScript errors being tracked either by tuning ingest or using filtering. Reduce JavaScript errors that impact customer performance. HTTP error rate KPI HTTP errors (or HTTP 4xx and 5xx responses) happen when calls to the backend are not successful. Goal: Measure and reduce the HTTP error rate to ensure your customers are able to do what they came to your site to do. Time to first byte KPI This KPI measures the time from navigation start (a user clicking a link) to the browser receiving the first byte of the response from the server. Goal: Reduce the time to first byte by improving CDN, network, and service performance. Core web vitals: Largest contentful paint (LCP) KPI Core Web Vitals are part of Google’s Page Experience Metrics. They measure the experience from when a page begins rendering. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) measures the time it takes to load the largest image after a user has navigated to a new page. Goal: Reduce LCP to 2.5 seconds or better for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Reduce FID to 100 milliseconds or better for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Core web vitals: First input delay (FID) KPI This KPI measures the experience from when a page begins rendering. Goal: Reduce FID to 100 milliseconds or better for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Cumulative layout shift (CLS) KPI This KPI measures how much the page layout shifts during render. Goal: Maintain a score of 0.1 or less for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Prerequisites Required knowledge Familiarity with synthetic monitoring Familiarity with browser monitoring Familiarity with basic Browser UI views Familiarity with SPA data in Browser UI Required Installation and Configuration Browser Pro installed in all pages SPA enabled for single page applications Synthetics monitors configured: Ping monitors configured for anonymous users Scripted synthetics check configured for login flow Monitors should be configured to test from all regions applicable to your users Monitors should be configured for each domain and each login flow Data retention for browser events is at least 2x an average sprint. Establish current state Review Instrumented Pages Review Browser apps and pages to make sure that everything you expect to report back to New Relic is. You can do this by reviewing the Page Views tab in the Browser UI or running the following query: SELECT uniques(pageUrl) from PageView LIMIT MAX Copy You may need to filter out URLs that contain request or customer ID. Validate Browser URL Grouping Ensure Browser segments are captured correctly so user experience performance is measurable in both the NewRelic UI as well as at the aggregate level when querying via NRQL. A segment is the text between two / in a URL or between . of a domain name. For example, in the URL website.com/product/widget-name, the segments are: website .com product widget-name When there are a lot of URLs with a lot of segments, URLs can get crushed, so that website.com/product/widget-name becomes website.com/ or website.com/product/. In this example, the first crushed URL is not particularly useful, but the second one may be a useful way of aggregating customer experience data for the product. Not sure whether you need to tune your configuration? Import the Segment Allow List Investigation dashboard in GitHub to help. Once you’ve identified which segments to add, you can add them using Segment allow lists in Browser. Understand How You Will Segment Your Data Make Customer Experience data understandable and actionable by breaking it out into different segments. In this case, segments refer to groups of data. It does not refer to sections of URLs, as in segment allow lists. Consider the following statements: Most of our users experience 3 seconds or better to first input delay. On average, we see 2 seconds to the largest contentful paint. Last week, there were 1 million page views. Compared to: Most of the users in the US, Canada, and EMEA experience 2 seconds or better to first input delay. Malaysia and Indonesia users experience 4 seconds; we are looking into this. Customers buying car insurance typically see 1 second to largest contentful paint. For home insurance, it’s 4 seconds. Last week, there were 700,000 page views on mobile browser apps compared to 300,000 on desktop. Let’s make sure we’re optimizing our mobile experience. Typical segmentation involves breaking down user experience into the following categories: Segment Guidance Region/Location Basic: Group by country. Browser events automatically contain the country code of requests, so there is nothing you need to do to break it out further. Advanced: Make regional grouping match regional SLO groups by creating your own region attribute using custom attributes in Browser. Facet by countryCode. Related attributes: regionCode city asnLatitude asnLongitude Device Break out performance and engagement device type so you can understand: Typical breakdown of desktop vs mobile browser users Experience of desktop vs mobile browser users Facet by deviceType. Related attributes: userAgentName userAgentOS userAgentVersion Product/Line of Business In this scenario, a product is a separate line of business or service provided by your organization. Some examples of industries and respective products: An insurance company that sells both car and house insurance A media company that has multiple streaming services or channels A travel company that provides car rental as well as hotel bookings Basic: Break out performance by product by: Faceting on pageUrl: Use this approach when multiple products are grouped into one browser app in New Relic. Faceting by appName: Use this approach when each product is instrumented as a separate web app. Grouping by appName and then facet: Use this approach when there are multiple apps in browser supporting one product. Advanced: Add product offering as a custom attribute to browser pages using custom attributes. Environment During instrumentation or afterwards, follow a naming convention that specifies the environment in Browser. Well named browser apps specify product and/or function as well as environment. Examples: account-management.prod hotels-book.prod car-insurance.uat Using app naming conventions to specify the environment supports filtering data in both the UI and in dashboards. For more information, see the documentation for how to rename Browser apps. Team In some organizations, a single team supports multiple products, while in others, a product is big enough to be supported by multiple teams. Report on team performance against customer experience or engagement by either adding the team name to the Browser app name (for example, account-management.prod.unicorn-squad) or by using custom attributes. Import the Quality Foundation Dashboard This step creates the dashboard that you will use to measure your customer experience and improve it. Clone the GitHub repository. Follow the GitHub repository README instructions to implement the dashboard. Make sure to align the dashboard to lines of business or customer facing offerings rather than teams. This ensures optimization time is spent where it is most impactful. Capture Current Performance For Each Dashboard Page Follow the GitHub README instructions. Use the dashboard from the previous step to understand the overall performance for each line of business. If relevant, apply filters to see performance across region or device. If values drop below targets and it matters, add it to the sheet as a candidate for improvement. Not worth tracking: A company that sells insurance in the US only notices poor performance in Malaysia. Worth tracking: A company that sells insurance in the US only notices poor performance with respect to mobile users in the US. Improvement Process Plan your work Whether you have a dedicated initiative to improve performance or classifying as ongoing maintenance, you need to track your progress at the end of every sprint. Decide which KPIs to Improve You now know what your user experience looks like across multiple lines of business. Where should you be improving? Start with business priorities. If you have clear business directives or have access to a senior manager above who does, you should focus on what matters most to your organization. For example, let’s say your company has recently launched a new initiative around a line of business but the KPIs associated with the UI are below target. This is where you should focus time initially. Next, focus on KPIs for each line of business. Finally, filter each line of business by device, region, etc., to see if additional focus is needed for specific regions or devices. Improve Targeted KPIs To track your progress, create a new dashboard or add a new page to the existing dashboard and name it Quality Foundation KPI Improvement. For more information, see Improve Web Uptime. Improve Page Load Performance Narrow your focus to specific pages that aren’t meeting target KPI values. For each page load KPI result that is out of bounds in the Quality Foundation Dashboard, remove the COMPARE WITH clause and add FACET pageUrl/targetGroupedUrl LIMIT MAX to find which pages are the poor performers. Use targetGroupedUrl when there are many results; for example, when the customer ID is part of the URL. Otherwise, use pageUrl. Original Dashboard query: FROM PageViewTiming SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) WHERE appName ='WebPortal' AND pageUrl LIKE '%phone%' SINCE 1 week AGO COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO Copy New query to identify problem pages: FROM PageViewTiming SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) WHERE appName ='WebPortal' AND pageUrl LIKE '%phone%' FACET targetGroupedUrl LIMIT MAX Copy Once you have identified which pages to improve, improve them following these best practices. Improve AJAX Response Times Find the slow requests. Go to the Ajax duration widget on the dashboard. View query, then open in query builder. Add facet requestUrl LIMIT MAX to the end of the query. Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - AjaxResponseTimes. Focus improving requests with a timeToSettle > 2.5s. Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to improve response times. See AJAX troubleshooting tips. Improve the AJAX Error Rate Find the failing requests. Go to Dashboards > Query builder. Enter FROM AjaxRequest SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode >= 400) WHERE httpResponseCode >= 200 AND <Ajax Request filter> SINCE 1 week AGO facet pageUrl, appName Copy Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - Pages with AjaxErrors. Run the query again for the most problematic pages to find the requests that are failing: FROM AjaxRequest SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode >= 400) WHERE httpResponseCode >= 200 AND pageUrl=<problematic page> AND appName = <corresponding app> <Ajax Request filter> SINCE 1 week AGO facet requestUrl Copy Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to improve response times. See AJAX troubleshooting tips. Improve Javascript Errors Find the most common failures. Go to Dashboards > Query builder Enter FROM JavaScriptError SELECT count(errorClass) SINCE 1 week AGO WHERE <PageView filter> FACET transactionName, errorClass, errorMessage, domain Copy Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - Javascript Errors. Use this information to figure out which errors need to be addressed Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to resolve errors that need addressing. See JavaScript errors page: Detect and analyze errors. Remove third party errors that do not add value. You may be using a third party JavaScript that is noisy but works as expected. You can take a couple of approaches: Remove the domain name from the JavaScript error/Pageview ratio widget and add it as its own widget so you can see unexpected changes. You can alert on this using Baseline NRQL alerts. Drop the JavaScript error using drop filters. Only use this option if the volume of errors is impacting your data ingest in a significant way. Be as specific as you can in the drop filter. Conclusion Best practices going forward: Revisit performance metrics (shared in this document as Quality Foundation KPIs) at the end of each sprint. Incorporate performance improvements into developer sprints. Openly share metrics with the lines of the business you support as well as other internal stakeholders. Define Customer Experience SLOs. Create alerts for business critical drops in Quality Foundation KPIs. Value Realization: At the end of this process you should now: Have an understanding of your end user experience in a way that is tangible, actionable, and easy for engineers as well as the business to understand. Know how releases impact your end customers. Know how your customers are impacted by service, infrastructure, or network level events. See latency issues caused by backend services if they exist. Have created, or be on the path to create, a common language with business owners so you are working together. This can open new avenues for recognition and sponsorship for new projects.",

Prerequisites Required knowledge Familiarity with synthetic monitoring Familiarity with browser monitoring Familiarity with basic Browser UI views Familiarity with SPA data in Browser UI Required installation and configuration Browser Pro installed in relevant pages SPA enabled for single page applications Insights retention for Browser events is at least 2x an average sprint. Establish current state Identify where the Bottom of the Funnel starts The Bottom of the Funnel is focused on the final steps of a user journey where a user has gone far enough to show intent to complete the journey. Some examples: Ecommerce user journey The user journey is simplified so you can focus on where the bottom of the funnel begins - at checkout. Most users entering the checkout phase plan to purchase something. Reducing errors and latency from this point onward is more likely to improve conversions than focusing on any other part of the funnel. Car insurance purchase user journey In the example above, you have the user’s interest in car insurance as they enter information, but you do not know their intent until they see the quote and continue to proceed. Distinguish between Pages and Actions The final steps of a user’s journey is likely to be a mix of full page loads and AJAX calls. You will need to know all pages and Ajax requests for the next step. If you are not sure which requests are running from the page in question, you can run: SELECT count(*) FROM AjaxRequest WHERE pageUrl like ‘%FILTER%’ FACET groupedRequestUrl SINCE 1 DAY AGO Copy Create a scripted Synthetics Check for the Bottom of the Funnel Make sure you have a scripted monitor for each path through the bottom of the funnel. The goal is to make sure your bottom of the funnel services are working around the clock. For example, you may have a checkout flow that calls a different payment API depending on the customer’s payment preferences. Import the Bottom of the Funnel Dashboard Follow the instructions documented in the public GitHub README. Capture Current Performance Follow the GitHub repository README instructions. Use the dashboard from the previous step to understand the bottom of the funnel performance. Create a plan to improve KPIs that don’t meet target values as well as reduce revenue at risk. Improvement process Plan your work Whether you have a dedicated initiative to improve performance or classifying as ongoing maintenance, you need to track your progress at the end of every sprint. For detailed information, see: Improve uptime Improve page load performance Improve AJAX performance Advanced topics Should I apply segmentation? Segmentation (breaking out performance into cohorts, such as region and device type) is a good idea if: Your organization has initiatives tied to addressing a target audience from a particular cohort that you can segment by using either custom attributes or data that is already available in New Relic. You are already familiar with Bottom of the Funnel Analysis and there is a significant enough difference in performance among different cohorts to warrant tracking and/or developer focus. Conclusion Best practices going forward Revisit performance metrics at the end of each sprint. Any time the user journey changes, revisit if the steps at the Bottom of the Funnel are the same. Incorporate changes in developer sprints as needed. Openly share metrics with the lines of the business you support as well as other internal stakeholders. Revisit your Customer Experience SLOs. Do you need to define more ambitious SLOs for the end of the funnel? Create alerts for business critical drops in Quality Foundation KPIs. Value realization At the end of this process you should: Know your user conversion rate and have addressed errors or performance issues that negatively impact it. Increased revenue for your company.

      "body": "Overview Digital customer experience is your end user’s experience across all your digital touch points. There are four core factors that impact a user’s experience: Availability (Is it reachable?) Performance (Does it perform well enough to be usable?) Content quality (Does it have what users need and can they find it?) Product and content relevance (Does it have what users care about?) Digital customer experience includes web, mobile, and IoT. The first version of this guide is focused on measuring the end user web experience. Quality Foundation is about creating a standard practice to help you understand your digital customer experience in a meaningful way. Desired Outcome This implementation guide will help you: Look at customer experience in relation to: Global functions, such as search and login Lines of business Regions Report back to business stakeholders on what they care about Prioritize what you work on Create a repeatable practice Key Performance Indicators Quality Foundation measures the following KPIs: JavaScript error rate KPI This KPI measures the number of JavaScript errors per page view. Goal: Remove irrelevant JavaScript errors being tracked either by tuning ingest or using filtering. Reduce JavaScript errors that impact customer performance. HTTP error rate KPI HTTP errors (or HTTP 4xx and 5xx responses) happen when calls to the backend are not successful. Goal: Measure and reduce the HTTP error rate to ensure your customers are able to do what they came to your site to do. Time to first byte KPI This KPI measures the time from navigation start (a user clicking a link) to the browser receiving the first byte of the response from the server. Goal: Reduce the time to first byte by improving CDN, network, and service performance. Core web vitals: Largest contentful paint (LCP) KPI Core Web Vitals are part of Google’s Page Experience Metrics. They measure the experience from when a page begins rendering. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) measures the time it takes to load the largest image after a user has navigated to a new page. Goal: Reduce LCP to 2.5 seconds or better for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Reduce FID to 100 milliseconds or better for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Core web vitals: First input delay (FID) KPI This KPI measures the experience from when a page begins rendering. Goal: Reduce FID to 100 milliseconds or better for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Cumulative layout shift (CLS) KPI This KPI measures how much the page layout shifts during render. Goal: Maintain a score of 0.1 or less for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Prerequisites Required knowledge Familiarity with synthetic monitoring Familiarity with browser monitoring Familiarity with basic Browser UI views Familiarity with SPA data in Browser UI Required Installation and Configuration Browser Pro installed in all pages SPA enabled for single page applications Synthetics monitors configured: Ping monitors configured for anonymous users Scripted synthetics check configured for login flow Monitors should be configured to test from all regions applicable to your users Monitors should be configured for each domain and each login flow Data retention for browser events is at least 2x an average sprint. Establish current state Review Instrumented Pages Review Browser apps and pages to make sure that everything you expect to report back to New Relic is. You can do this by reviewing the Page Views tab in the Browser UI or running the following query: SELECT uniques(pageUrl) from PageView LIMIT MAX Copy You may need to filter out URLs that contain request or customer ID. Validate Browser URL Grouping Ensure Browser segments are captured correctly so user experience performance is measurable in both the NewRelic UI as well as at the aggregate level when querying via NRQL. A segment is the text between two / in a URL or between . of a domain name. For example, in the URL website.com/product/widget-name, the segments are: website .com product widget-name When there are a lot of URLs with a lot of segments, URLs can get crushed, so that website.com/product/widget-name becomes website.com/ or website.com/product/. In this example, the first crushed URL is not particularly useful, but the second one may be a useful way of aggregating customer experience data for the product. Not sure whether you need to tune your configuration? Import the Segment Allow List Investigation dashboard in GitHub to help. Once you’ve identified which segments to add, you can add them using Segment allow lists in Browser. Understand How You Will Segment Your Data Make Customer Experience data understandable and actionable by breaking it out into different segments. In this case, segments refer to groups of data. It does not refer to sections of URLs, as in segment allow lists. Consider the following statements: Most of our users experience 3 seconds or better to first input delay. On average, we see 2 seconds to the largest contentful paint. Last week, there were 1 million page views. Compared to: Most of the users in the US, Canada, and EMEA experience 2 seconds or better to first input delay. Malaysia and Indonesia users experience 4 seconds; we are looking into this. Customers buying car insurance typically see 1 second to largest contentful paint. For home insurance, it’s 4 seconds. Last week, there were 700,000 page views on mobile browser apps compared to 300,000 on desktop. Let’s make sure we’re optimizing our mobile experience. Typical segmentation involves breaking down user experience into the following categories: Segment Guidance Region/Location Basic: Group by country. Browser events automatically contain the country code of requests, so there is nothing you need to do to break it out further. Advanced: Make regional grouping match regional SLO groups by creating your own region attribute using custom attributes in Browser. Facet by countryCode. Related attributes: regionCode city asnLatitude asnLongitude Device Break out performance and engagement device type so you can understand: Typical breakdown of desktop vs mobile browser users Experience of desktop vs mobile browser users Facet by deviceType. Related attributes: userAgentName userAgentOS userAgentVersion Product/Line of Business In this scenario, a product is a separate line of business or service provided by your organization. Some examples of industries and respective products: An insurance company that sells both car and house insurance A media company that has multiple streaming services or channels A travel company that provides car rental as well as hotel bookings Basic: Break out performance by product by: Faceting on pageUrl: Use this approach when multiple products are grouped into one browser app in New Relic. Faceting by appName: Use this approach when each product is instrumented as a separate web app. Grouping by appName and then facet: Use this approach when there are multiple apps in browser supporting one product. Advanced: Add product offering as a custom attribute to browser pages using custom attributes. Environment During instrumentation or afterwards, follow a naming convention that specifies the environment in Browser. Well named browser apps specify product and/or function as well as environment. Examples: account-management.prod hotels-book.prod car-insurance.uat Using app naming conventions to specify the environment supports filtering data in both the UI and in dashboards. For more information, see the documentation for how to rename Browser apps. Team In some organizations, a single team supports multiple products, while in others, a product is big enough to be supported by multiple teams. Report on team performance against customer experience or engagement by either adding the team name to the Browser app name (for example, account-management.prod.unicorn-squad) or by using custom attributes. Import the Quality Foundation Dashboard This step creates the dashboard that you will use to measure your customer experience and improve it. Clone the GitHub repository. Follow the GitHub repository README instructions to implement the dashboard. Make sure to align the dashboard to lines of business or customer facing offerings rather than teams. This ensures optimization time is spent where it is most impactful. Capture Current Performance For Each Dashboard Page Follow the GitHub README instructions. Use the dashboard from the previous step to understand the overall performance for each line of business. If relevant, apply filters to see performance across region or device. If values drop below targets and it matters, add it to the sheet as a candidate for improvement. Not worth tracking: A company that sells insurance in the US only notices poor performance in Malaysia. Worth tracking: A company that sells insurance in the US only notices poor performance with respect to mobile users in the US. Improvement Process Plan your work Whether you have a dedicated initiative to improve performance or classifying as ongoing maintenance, you need to track your progress at the end of every sprint. Decide which KPIs to Improve You now know what your user experience looks like across multiple lines of business. Where should you be improving? Start with business priorities. If you have clear business directives or have access to a senior manager above who does, you should focus on what matters most to your organization. For example, let’s say your company has recently launched a new initiative around a line of business but the KPIs associated with the UI are below target. This is where you should focus time initially. Next, focus on KPIs for each line of business. Finally, filter each line of business by device, region, etc., to see if additional focus is needed for specific regions or devices. Improve Targeted KPIs To track your progress, create a new dashboard or add a new page to the existing dashboard and name it Quality Foundation KPI Improvement. For more information, see Improve Web Uptime. Improve Page Load Performance Narrow your focus to specific pages that aren’t meeting target KPI values. For each page load KPI result that is out of bounds in the Quality Foundation Dashboard, remove the COMPARE WITH clause and add FACET pageUrl/targetGroupedUrl LIMIT MAX to find which pages are the poor performers. Use targetGroupedUrl when there are many results; for example, when the customer ID is part of the URL. Otherwise, use pageUrl. Original Dashboard query: FROM PageViewTiming SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) WHERE appName ='WebPortal' AND pageUrl LIKE '%phone%' SINCE 1 week AGO COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO Copy New query to identify problem pages: FROM PageViewTiming SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) WHERE appName ='WebPortal' AND pageUrl LIKE '%phone%' FACET targetGroupedUrl LIMIT MAX Copy Once you have identified which pages to improve, improve them following these best practices. Improve AJAX Response Times Find the slow requests. Go to the Ajax duration widget on the dashboard. View query, then open in query builder. Add facet requestUrl LIMIT MAX to the end of the query. Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - AjaxResponseTimes. Focus improving requests with a timeToSettle > 2.5s. Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to improve response times. See AJAX troubleshooting tips. Improve the AJAX Error Rate Find the failing requests. Go to Dashboards > Query builder. Enter FROM AjaxRequest SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode >= 400) WHERE httpResponseCode >= 200 AND <Ajax Request filter> SINCE 1 week AGO facet pageUrl, appName Copy Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - Pages with AjaxErrors. Run the query again for the most problematic pages to find the requests that are failing: FROM AjaxRequest SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode >= 400) WHERE httpResponseCode >= 200 AND pageUrl=<problematic page> AND appName = <corresponding app> <Ajax Request filter> SINCE 1 week AGO facet requestUrl Copy Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to improve response times. See AJAX troubleshooting tips. Improve Javascript Errors Find the most common failures. Go to Dashboards > Query builder Enter FROM JavaScriptError SELECT count(errorClass) SINCE 1 week AGO WHERE <PageView filter> FACET transactionName, errorClass, errorMessage, domain Copy Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - Javascript Errors. Use this information to figure out which errors need to be addressed Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to resolve errors that need addressing. See JavaScript errors page: Detect and analyze errors. Remove third party errors that do not add value. You may be using a third party JavaScript that is noisy but works as expected. You can take a couple of approaches: Remove the domain name from the JavaScript error/Pageview ratio widget and add it as its own widget so you can see unexpected changes. You can alert on this using Baseline NRQL alerts. Drop the JavaScript error using drop filters. Only use this option if the volume of errors is impacting your data ingest in a significant way. Be as specific as you can in the drop filter. Conclusion Best practices going forward: Revisit performance metrics (shared in this document as Quality Foundation KPIs) at the end of each sprint. Incorporate performance improvements into developer sprints. Openly share metrics with the lines of the business you support as well as other internal stakeholders. Define Customer Experience SLOs. Create alerts for business critical drops in Quality Foundation KPIs. Value Realization: At the end of this process you should now: Have an understanding of your end user experience in a way that is tangible, actionable, and easy for engineers as well as the business to understand. Know how releases impact your end customers. Know how your customers are impacted by service, infrastructure, or network level events. See latency issues caused by backend services if they exist. Have created, or be on the path to create, a common language with business owners so you are working together. This can open new avenues for recognition and sponsorship for new projects.",

Page Load KPI How to improve time to first byte (TTFB): Time to first byte measures the time from navigation start (a user clicking a link) to the browser receiving the first byte of the response from the server. If users in the 75th percentile are experiencing a TTFB of greater than 0.5s for one or more of your pages, you can break timings down further by querying the following attributes in PageView: backendDuration connectionSetupDuration dnsLookupDuration networkDuration Frequently slowness prior to rendering is caused by slowness in the backend, either from third party APIs or backend applications. Synthetics monitoring for third party APIs helps operations and development teams understand when the root cause is outside of their control. Even if you cannot control the code, you can influence the outcome by sharing synthetics results with the third party to help them understand what your customers are experiencing. If the backend applications are owned by you or your team, you can use APM agents, Pixie, or OpenTelemetry to understand and manage performance. To make cross team communication easier, we recommend implementing Service Level Management boundaries. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) Cumulative layout shift is a score that indicates how much content shifts once it has already loaded. General tips and tricks for improving CLS: Specify dimensions for stylesheets and let the browser’s default CSS control the aspect ratio. Statically reserve space for ad slots. Avoid ads near the top of the viewport. Avoid inserting new content above existing content. Precompute sufficient space for embeds. Additional resources: Google’s approach to CLS optimization Lighthouse is a tool by Google that runs a synthetic test against a specific page and provides a list of recommendations that include how to optimize CLS. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) Largest contentful paint measures the difference between the start of page render until the time to paint the largest content element. Common causes for a slow lcp, according to web.dev: Slow server response times Render-blocking JavaScript and CSS Slow resource load times Client-side rendering Use Browser session trace information to understand which of the common causes above factor into the particular page you are trying to optimize. Approaches to improve LCP: Making use of CDNs and paying attention to caching and edge server performance Establishing third party connections early Delaying non-critical Javascript and CSS Additional resources: Google’s approach to LCP optimization Lighthouse is a tool by Google that runs a synthetic test against a specific page and provides a list of recommendations that include how to optimize CLS. First Input Delay (FID) First input delay is the time between when a user first interacts with a page to the time when the browser is able to respond. It’s a field metric that varies based on real user behavior (results vary based on user impatience and action timing) but can be optimized by reducing TBT, total blocking time. To do this, you need to: Break up long blocking tasks. Optimize bloated JavaScript. Look at moving logic server side and/or use web workers to run threads in the background. Use Browser session trace information to understand where your blocking intervals are occurring and for how long they last.

      "body": "Desired outcome Increase revenue by resolving issues that appear when a user attempts to complete an action. Key performance indicators Bottom of the Funnel Analysis measures the following KPIs: KPI Description Goal Bottom of the Funnel Success Rate/Conversion Rate The rate of conversion once a user has gone far enough to demonstrate intent to complete an action to actual completion. Examples of this are rate of: Checkout -> Order submission Insurance form review -> submission Completing sign up details -> submission Increase the rate of conversion by addressing errors and latency at the bottom of the funnel Revenue at Risk due to Latency Value of a conversion * number of pages or interactions in the bottom of the funnel that are slower than the industry threshold. Focus on reducing this value by improving page KPIs Revenue at Risk due to Errors Value of a conversion * number of backend errors in the bottom of the funnel interactions Tune this value to make it meaningful by filtering out errors that aren't visible to the end user. Once this is meaningful, focus on reducing it. Create an alert to notify you if it suddenly trends upward. Prerequisites Required knowledge Familiarity with synthetic monitoring Familiarity with browser monitoring Familiarity with basic Browser UI views Familiarity with SPA data in Browser UI Required installation and configuration Browser Pro installed in relevant pages SPA enabled for single page applications Insights retention for Browser events is at least 2x an average sprint. Establish current state Identify where the Bottom of the Funnel starts The Bottom of the Funnel is focused on the final steps of a user journey where a user has gone far enough to show intent to complete the journey. Some examples: Ecommerce user journey The user journey is simplified so you can focus on where the bottom of the funnel begins - at checkout. Most users entering the checkout phase plan to purchase something. Reducing errors and latency from this point onward is more likely to improve conversions than focusing on any other part of the funnel. Car insurance purchase user journey In the example above, you have the user’s interest in car insurance as they enter information, but you do not know their intent until they see the quote and continue to proceed. Distinguish between Pages and Actions The final steps of a user’s journey is likely to be a mix of full page loads and AJAX calls. You will need to know all pages and Ajax requests for the next step. If you are not sure which requests are running from the page in question, you can run: SELECT count(*) FROM AjaxRequest WHERE pageUrl like ‘%FILTER%’ FACET groupedRequestUrl SINCE 1 DAY AGO Copy Create a scripted Synthetics Check for the Bottom of the Funnel Make sure you have a scripted monitor for each path through the bottom of the funnel. The goal is to make sure your bottom of the funnel services are working around the clock. For example, you may have a checkout flow that calls a different payment API depending on the customer’s payment preferences. Import the Bottom of the Funnel Dashboard Follow the instructions documented in the public GitHub README. Capture Current Performance Follow the GitHub repository README instructions. Use the dashboard from the previous step to understand the bottom of the funnel performance. Create a plan to improve KPIs that don’t meet target values as well as reduce revenue at risk. Improvement process Plan your work Whether you have a dedicated initiative to improve performance or classifying as ongoing maintenance, you need to track your progress at the end of every sprint. For detailed information, see: Improve uptime Improve page load performance Improve AJAX performance Advanced topics Should I apply segmentation? Segmentation (breaking out performance into cohorts, such as region and device type) is a good idea if: Your organization has initiatives tied to addressing a target audience from a particular cohort that you can segment by using either custom attributes or data that is already available in New Relic. You are already familiar with Bottom of the Funnel Analysis and there is a significant enough difference in performance among different cohorts to warrant tracking and/or developer focus. Conclusion Best practices going forward Revisit performance metrics at the end of each sprint. Any time the user journey changes, revisit if the steps at the Bottom of the Funnel are the same. Incorporate changes in developer sprints as needed. Openly share metrics with the lines of the business you support as well as other internal stakeholders. Revisit your Customer Experience SLOs. Do you need to define more ambitious SLOs for the end of the funnel? Create alerts for business critical drops in Quality Foundation KPIs. Value realization At the end of this process you should: Know your user conversion rate and have addressed errors or performance issues that negatively impact it. Increased revenue for your company. Created, or be on the path to create, a common language with business owners so you are working together; opening new avenues for recognition and sponsorship for new projects.",

Set up an alert to notify you when multiple locations fail. 2. Create workloads Create workloads that correlate synthetic monitors with browser applications, services, and infrastructure. Include a link to the workload in the alert runbook. You can also find the correlated workload for a synthetic using global search. Make sure that alerts are configured for each tier of your workload. This way you can see the health of each of the tiers in one view. This will save you time in troubleshooting. You do not need to create alert notifications for each tier to benefit from this view. 3. Investigate outages at lowest tier first When an outage occurs, start investigating at the lowest tier that is alerting. For instance, if you see that you have an infrastructure issue and a JavaScript issue, investigate infrastructure prior to javascript unless you have a second person or team you can delegate that to. Use the tools that are available to you for troubleshooting: Make sure that distributed tracing is enabled for browser monitoring as well as APM. Use the Browser UI to help you understand what is happening at the end user tier. Use Lookout to help you understand what’s causing flapping or reoccurring issues.",

      "body": "Overview Teams suffer from alert fatigue when they experience high alert volumes and alerts that are not aligned to business impact. As they start to believe that most alerts are false, they may prioritize easy to resolve alerts over others.  Also, they may close unresolved incidents so they can stay within their SLA targets. The result will be slower incident responses, magnified issue scope, and increased severity when true business impacting issues occur. Alert Quality Management (AQM) focuses on reducing the number of nuisance incidents so that you focus only on alerts with true business impact.  This reduces alert fatigue and ensures that you and your team focus your attention on the right places at the right times. You are a good candidate for AQM if: You have too many alerts. You have alerts that stay open for long time periods. Your alerts are not relevant. Your customers discover your issues before your monitoring tools do. You can't see the value of your observability tool(s). Desired outcome An alert strategy based on measuring business impact will result in faster response times and greater proactive awareness of critical events.  An improved alert signal to noise ratio reduces confusion and improves rapid identification and problem isolation. AQM's overall goal is to ensure that fewer, more valuable, incidents are created, resulting in: Increased uptime and availability Reduced MTTR Decreased alert volume The ability to easily identify alerts that are not valuable, so you can either make them valuable or remove them. The AQM process described in this guide generates the key performance indicators and metrics that you will use to measure progress towards these goals.  The metrics are measured in real time, published in a dashboard, and are used to drive a continuous improvement process that identifies and reduces nuisance alerts and increases user engagement in incident investigation. AQM does not encompass anomaly detection or AIOps, which are designed to detect unknown or unexpected modes of failure.  The two practices (AQM and ML/AI) work hand in hand, they are not mutually exclusive. Key performance indicators You will use the AQM process to collect and measure the following KPIs: Incident volume Incident Count Accumulated incident time Mean Time to Close (MTTC) Percent Under 5 Minutes User Engagement Mean Time to Investigate  (MTTI) % of Incidents Investigated These KPIs will help you to find the noisiest and least valuable alerts so you can improve their value or eliminate them.  You will then use the long term metric trends to show real business impact to management and stakeholders.  Detailed information on each metric follows. Incident volume You should treat incidents (with or without alerts) like a queue of tasks.  Just like a queue, the number of alerts should spend time near zero. Each incident should be a trigger for action to resolve the condition.  If an alert does not result in action, then you should question the value of the alert condition. If you see a constant rate of incidents or specific incidents that are \"always-on\", then you should question why. Are you in a constant state of business impact, or do you simply have a large volume of noise? The alert volume KPIs help you to answer those questions and to measure progress towards a healthy state of high quality alerting. Incident count KPI Incident Count is the number of incidents generated over a period of time. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. Goal: Reduce the number of low value / nuisance incidents. Best practices: Ensure condition settings are intended to detect real business impact. Ensure condition settings are detecting abnormal behavior. Communicate that the incident details \"Acknowledge\" feature helps measure meaningful and actionable alerts. See Percentage Incident Acknowledge KPI. Report AQM KPIs to all stakeholders. Accumulated incident duration KPI Accumulated incident duration is the total sum of minutes that all the incidents accumulated over a period of time. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. Goal: Reduce the total accumulated minutes of incidents. Best practices: Do not manually close incidents. Manual closure will skew the real duration of incident length. Eliminate alerts that do not result in any remediation actions from the recipients. Improve percent investigated and mean-time-to-investigate KPIs by communicating their importance in improving detection and response times. Report AQM KPIs to all Stakeholders. Mean time to close (MTTC) KPI Average duration of incidents within the period of time measured. Goal: Reduce MTTC Best practices: Do not manually close incidents. Manual closure will skew the real duration of incident length. Improve Reliability Engineering skills. Report AQM KPIs to all stakeholders. Percent under 5 minutes KPI Percentage of incidents where the duration of the incident is under five minutes. This can be an indicator of incident flapping. Goal: Minimize percentage of incidents with short durations Best practices: Ensure that conditions are detecting legitimate deviations from expected behavior. See Baselining and Service Level Management. Ensure that conditions are detecting legitimate deviations that correlate to business impact or impending business impact. User engagement You should measure the value of an incident by the amount of attention it receives.  Engagement in this context is measured by whether or not an incident has been acknowledged. The amount of engagement an individual alert receives is a direct measurement of its value.  More engagement implies a valuable alert, less (or zero) engagement implies a nuisance alert that should be modified or disabled. There is a significant difference between measuring the moment of incident awareness vs. acknowledging the moment resolution activity begins. If you are using an integration with New Relic Alerting, be sure that the \"acknowledge\" event that is sent to New Relic is triggered when resolution activity begins, not when the incident is sent to the external incident management tool.  For more information regarding the standard Incident Management process, see \"Incident Management Process: 5 Steps to Effective Resolution Posted on August 31, 2020 by OnPage Corporation. -- in reference to ITIL4\" Percentage Acknowledged KPI Incidents acknowledged identifies the percentage of incidents that have been engaged with and had their acknowledged property set to true. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. Goal: Increase the percentage of incident engagement. Best practices: Educate the DevOps team on when it is appropriate to acknowledge an incident alert. Gamify alert acknowledgement to drive usage. Discourage mass acknowledgement exercises. Mean time to investigate (MTTI) KPI Mean time to investigate identifies the average time it takes for an incident to be triaged. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. Goal: Reduce the mean time to investigate Best practices: Work at building incident responder's confidence in alerts. Ensure that valuable alerts are acknowledged. Incentivize response teams to respond quickly to alerts. Prerequisites Before you begin, if you don't have equivalent experience, complete the New Relic University (NRU) Overview Course. Also, make sure you have a basic understanding of: NR1 Alert policy and conditions configuration NR1 incident notification channel webhook configuration NR1 NRQL NR1 alerting best practices NR1 APM & Infrastructure How to baseline data in order to determine anomalies vs. normal behavior. Establish current state of your KPIs As with any continuous improvement process, the first step of AQM is to establish the current state of your KPIs. To do so, perform the following tasks: Install and configure the incident event webhook Install the AQM Dashboard Perform initial AQM orientation and enablement Accumulate AQM data Perform second enablement session Install and configure the incident event webhook The webhook will create New Relic events for each incident as it proceeds through its lifecycle (open, acknowledge, close). To ensure that the AQM process generates accurate and valuable findings, this webhook must be added as a notification channel to every alert policy. The AQM process requires incident, not violation data. This is why you will not be using the default NrAiIncident event, which provides violation data only.  Instead, you will use this webhook to send the required incident data to New Relic. To use the webhook, do the following: Identify your primary production account and each of your accounts that you will be analyzing with the AQM process. Install the incident event webhook into each account that will participate in the AQM process and configure the webhook to report nrAQMIncident events to your primary production account. Assign the webhook as a notification channel to every alert policy in each account. This example shows a webhook notification channel assigned to each alert policy for a New Relic account with multiple sub-accounts. The webhook, AQM dashboard, and detailed installation instructions can be found in the New Relic OMA resource center on GitHub. Install the AQM dashboard The AQM dashboard is the primary asset that drives the AQM process.  You need to install the AQM dashboard into the primary production account you identified in the \"Install and configure incident event webhook\" step you previously performed by doing the following: Download the dashboard definition JSON file from the New Relic OMA resource center GitHub repo. Import the definition into your primary production account. For more details on importing dashboards, see the New Relic Introduction to dashboards documentation Perform initial AQM orientation and enablement During this phase, your incident management team(s) and other stakeholders will learn the goals of the AQM process and the scope of their involvement in it. The most critical portion of this task is educating your team on the importance of acknowledging incident alerts, since that's how the alert's value is determined.  In general, instruct them to follow these guidelines: If you look at an alert and decide to take any sort of further investigative action, acknowledge the alert. If you typically close an alert without doing anything else, do not acknowledge the alert. If the incident alert is always on, do not close or acknowledge it. For further details, see Second Enablement Session. You can use the first session template presentation to communicate this material to your stakeholders. Accumulate AQM data The overall process requires at least two weeks of data before it can proceed.  During this time, you should periodically check the following items: Confirm that incident alert event data is accumulating. Confirm that the webhook is attached to every alert policy. Ensure that incident responders are following the alert acknowledgement guidelines. Perform second enablement session During this phase, you will introduce incident management teams and other stakeholders to the initial AQM data and the ongoing continuous  improvement process you'll be following. The process consists of four activities: Review AQM Dashboard and KPI Trending - Here you and the stakeholders will look at the AQM KPIs and identify their week over week trends.  The team should identify areas where KPIs are not improving and develop strategies to drive improvement. Identify Achievements, Challenges, and Opportunities - Here you and the stakeholders will map the current state of alert quality to business impact, identifying areas where improvement has resulted in better business outcomes and areas where problems are impacting business outcomes. Incident Policy Review - Using the AQM dashboard, you and the stakeholders will identify the noisiest incident policies.  Once identified, those policies should be evaluated as detailed in step 4 below. Alert Policy Recommendations - In this step, you and the stakeholders will review the noisiest policies using the following criteria: Do the alerts have any business impact? Are the policies properly configured? Are they telling us something about the resource that needs to be fixed? Are the policies necessary? (i.e. do they have business impact) Are the thresholds set properly? Technical recommendations - Here, you and the stakeholders will review any technical recommendations, including: Are there application / system problems for engineering to review? Are there poorly constructed policies that need to be fixed? Are there instrumentation gaps? You can use the second session template presentation to keep this part of the AQM process organized. Improvement process This is the ongoing phase of the continuous improvement process where you periodically review your accumulated AQM data and make adjustments as needed to alert policies. You should perform this step once a week until your alert volume is acceptable. You can then perform it less frequently. During this phase you should: Report your KPIs each week to upper management to ensure that the stakeholder teams are appropriately prioritizing the work and to show that progress towards the promised business outcomes are being reached. Record and retain your weekly KPIs  over periods of months to years to establish a baseline and to show the rate of improvement. You should keep in mind that this is a continuous improvment process, you will continue to collect and evaluate the KPIs over long periods of time to ensure you are meeting your AQM goals. Value realization Once the AQM process is established, you will see significant reductions in the volume of alerts while reliability and stability remain the same or improve.  In addition, you should see that your alerts have a clear and unambiguous business impact.  Your AQM KPIs will provide quantifiable proof of these improvements. Once you are firmly on the path to AQM's goals, consider moving to other use cases within the Uptime, Performance, and Reliability value stream, such as Service Level Management, or Reliability Engineering.  You can also move to other observability maturity value streams, such as Customer Experience. KPI reference Following are the descriptions of each KPI as well as sample NRQL queries that will extract them from the New Relic platform.  These KPIs are also included in the AQM dashboard that can be downloaded from the New Relic OMA resource center GitHub repo. Incident volume Incident count KPI Incident Count is the number of incidents generated over a period of time. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. NRQL: FROM nrAQMIncident SELECT count(*) AS 'Incident Count' WHERE current_state='open' AND severity='CRITICAL' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Accumulated incident duration KPI Accumulated incident duration is the total sum of minutes that all the incidents accumulated over a period of time. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. NRQL: FROM nrAQMIncident SELECT sum(duration)/(1000*60) AS 'Incident Minutes' WHERE current_state='closed' AND severity='CRITICAL' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Mean time to close (MTTC) KPI Average duration of incidents within the period of time measured. NRQL: FROM nrAQMIncident SELECT average(duration/(1000*60)) AS 'Incident MTTC (minutes)' WHERE current_state='closed' AND severity='CRITICAL' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Percent under 5 minutes KPI Percentage of incidents where the duration of the incident is under five minutes. This can be an indicator of incident flapping. NRQL: FROM nrAQMIncident SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE duration <= 5 * 60 * 100) AS '% Under 5min' WHERE current_state='closed' AND severity='CRITICAL' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Incident engagement Percentage Acknowledged KPI Incidents acknowledged identifies the percentage of incidents that have been engaged with and had their acknowledged property set to true. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. NRQL: FROM nrAQMIncident SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE current_state='acknowledged')/filter(count(*), WHERE current_state='open')*100 AS '% Investigated' WHERE severity='CRITICAL' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Mean time to investigate (MTTI) KPI Mean time to investigate identifies the average time it takes for an incident to be triaged. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. NRQL: FROM nrAQMIncident SELECT average(duration/(1000*60)) AS 'Incident MTTI (minutes)' WHERE current_state='acknowledged' AND severity='CRITICAL' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO",

      "body": "Overview IT Operations is expected to provide services that meet the business’s requirements for performance and reliability. However, many ops teams attempt to measure performace and reliability using legacy methods, like measuring resource consumption. That, in turn, requires that they create complex dashboards of granular metrics which they then try to correlate with application performance and reliability. These complex dashboards require subject matter experts to interpret the results for business stakeholders. Legacy methods create barriers to understanding what a good system state looks like and how bad system states impact the business. Essentially, IT ends up not sharing a common metric vocabulary with the business. This fundamental disconnect will result in the perception that IT is not able to deliver the services that the business requires, with all the implications and impacts that perception carries. Service Level Management (SLM) eliminates that disconnect by better explaining the overall performance of a system in terms that are easily understood by both IT and the business. The intent is to show whether or not the system is meeting its performance and reliability expectations, and if it is trending toward or away from improvement, so proactive steps can be taken. The end goal is that systems are better oriented toward desired business outcomes with IT’s attention focused on issues in areas with the highest business impact. You are a good candidate for SLM if any of the following are true: The business impact of performance and reliability issues are not well understood by all stakeholders. Your MTTx is too high. You are collecting many resource consumption metrics (such as CPU, disk, or memory) or are maintaining many metric correlation rules in order to identify system problems. You can’t see the value of your observability tool(s). Desired outcome Service Level Management’s overall goal is to easily measure and communicate the overall health, performance, and quality of your digital products and services to all stakeholders. By implementing SLM at key output points in your systems, you will have a simpler and more responsive observability practice, tighter alignment with the business, and faster paths to improvement. The SLM process described in this guide will help you to identify the points in your systems where you should measure the key performance metrics of service performance and quality. It will also define and drive a simpler alerting strategy, continuous improvement methodologies, and improved problem resolution workflows. Key performance indicators You will use the SLM process to collect and measure the following KPIs, often referred to as the “Golden Signals”: Service Response Time Service Quality (error rate) Service Level Objective Attainment (Availability) Service Uptime These KPIs directly measure the most important aspects of an IT service, speed and quality, in a way that is easy and intuitive to understand and communicate to technical and non-technical stakeholders. Detailed information on each metric follows. Service response time KPI Service response time measures the amount of time a service requires to process a transaction. It starts when a transaction request is received by the service and ends when the response is sent. Goal: Reduce transaction response time. Best practices: Measure response time at service boundaries. Use continuous improvement processes to drive down response times. Ensure that non-business transactions (i.e. health checks) are not included / measured. Map this KPI back to business impact. Report KPIs to all stakeholders. Service quality KPI Service quality is the number of transactions that result in an unhandled error. Typically, these are transactions whose HTTP response code is greater than or equal to 400. Goal: Reduce the number of unhandled errors. Best practices: Measure error rates at service boundaries. Continually identify and remediate sources of high error volumes. Map this KPI back to business impact. Report KPIs to all stakeholders. Service level objective attainment KPI SLO attainment is the percentage of time a business service is meeting its response time and quality goals. Goal: Improve response time and quality to ensure high SLO attainment. Best practices: Use continuous improvement processes to maintain / improve SLO attainment. Map this KPI back to business impact. Report KPIs to all stakeholders. Service uptime KPI Service uptime is the percentage of time a service can be reached by at least one client. Typically this is measured using synthetic transactions from representative remote locations. Goal: Use continuous improvement processes to watch uptime metrics and take appropriate steps to ensure uptime meets business requirements. Best practices: Use continuous improvement processes to maintain / improve SLO attainment. Map this KPI back to business impact Report KPIs to all stakeholders. Prerequisites Before you begin, if you don’t have equivalent experience, you should complete the New Relic University (NRU) Overview Course. You should also have a basic understanding of: New Relic One APM and infrastructure monitoring New Relic One Dashboards and NRQL New Relic One alerting best practices Establish current state of your KPIs As with any continuous improvement process, the first step of SLM is to establish the current state of your KPIs. To do so, you will need to perform the following tasks: Determine in-scope services Identify service boundaries Deploy instrumentation Perform SLM educational workshops Analyze KPIs and set baseline SLOs Establish / Optimize Alerting Build problem resolution workflows Execute continuous improvement review To help illustrate this process, we are going to apply it to an example IT service, an ecommerce site for a cellular telephone provider. Determine in-scope services You should first identify the IT services that are going to be in-scope for the initial iteration of the SLM process. These services should be key to ongoing business operations and as close to your customers as possible. Most commonly, you will be applying the SLM process to an application, since that is the service your customers are expecting you to deliver. SLM can be applied to infrastructure-based services; however, it is a more advanced application of SLM which is applicable to a much smaller set of organizations. If you are considering implementing SLM for infrastructure, you should ensure that the service(s) you are instrumenting are actually the closest to your organization’s end-customer. If your infrastructure is hosting a customer-facing app, then the app should be the target of SLM. Absent anything else, a good methodology for identifying in-scope services is to consult your disaster recovery plan. Typically, the most critical business services are prioritized there. Identify service boundaries Next, you should identify each service’s boundary, which is the service component that is closest to the client sending transaction requests. This should be the application receiving the request from the client, browser, or mobile device, and may also be known as the \"external API.\" Reverse proxies, CDNs, and load balancers are not part of the service boundary. Their service level compliance should be measured via the Uptime KPI (external test requests for connectivity). If your services are using APM, you can identify service boundaries using the service map or dependencies features. A service component is on a boundary if it has no inbound connections. In the example below (from a service map), you can see that the WebPortal is on the boundary. An example of using service maps in New Relic One to identify service boundaries. In contrast, the following screenshot (from the dependencies page) shows that the Inventory Service is not on a boundary since it has incoming connections from the WebPortal. Subsequent examples in this guide will build on the WebPortal service boundary. An example of using the dependencies UI in New Relic One to identify service boundaries. You should understand that the SLM process defines a service boundary as being downstream of any dependencies. The service boundary is the point where all the effects and impacts of dependent services are measured as they contribute to the total response time and quality of the service. By measuring service level compliance at the boundary, you will be able to see the impact that all service components upstream of the boundary have on service delivery. This means that your initial steps into SLM can focus on the services that are closest to your users, yet still capture the contribution of more distant services. As your practice matures, you will be able to identify the next round of upstream services that would benefit from direct SLM instrumentation. In our example, the WebService is downstream of the Fulfillment, Plan, Promo, Login, and Inventory services (among others). By applying SLM at the WebService, we will be seeing the impact of the upstream services on the WebService. Any impactful issues with an upstream service will be reflected in the WebService’s service level KPIs. By instrumenting one service, we are capturing the contribution of five additional services. This greatly simplifies our observability practice. In time, problematic upstream services will self-identify themselves as candidates for direct SLM instrumentation. Deploy instrumentation To collect SLM service response time and transaction success KPIs, you need to deploy instrumentation into the components of your production apps on the service boundary. If you don’t have instrumentation that can do this in production already, then you will need to engage the teams and stakeholders that can help you to get this done. For detailed information on deploying the New Relic instrumentation that can gather this information, see our APM install documentation. The uptime KPIs can be collected using synthetic transactions, which don’t require any instrumentation to be added to the service. If needed, you can start your SLM journey there while waiting for the direct instrumentation to be deployed. The uptime tests should perform a basic, yet realistic, check of the service’s functionality. For detailed information on this capability, see our synthetic monitoring documentation. Perform SLM educational workshops You should share the self-paced New Relic Essentials training course with the appropriate stakeholders so they can understand how the New Relic technology platform will aid in the SLM process. Analyze KPIs and set baseline SLOs The SLM process uses speed and quality as its key performance indicators. In technical terms, speed means response time and quality means error rate. At the end of this phase, you will have created baseline service level objectives for each service in the form of a percentage. For example: “98% of service X’s transactions will be error free and occur in less than 500 milliseconds.” For each in-scope service, you should analyze speed and quality at the service boundary. This will give you an overall understanding of how the entire service and all of its dependencies are performing. As you iterate through the SLM process, you can then identify and prioritize the upstream service components that require direct SLM instrumentation. To analyze KPIs, you should do the following for each service: Identify the volume and 95th percentile response time for each of the service’s transactions over a relatively long period of time, typically between seven days and one month. It is important that you use percentile rather than average, so you can see the entire range of response times, including outliers. If you use averages, you will hide outliers. The following is an example of the initial baseline report. Here you can see the volume, p95 response time, and error volume for the WebPortal and a few other services. The WebPortal’s p95 response time is .36 seconds (or 36 milliseconds), so we have decided to set the SLO target to 0.4 seconds. Example of an initial baseline report measuring volume and 95th percentile response time. Next you should review and identify any non-business transactions, since they should not be included in the SLO attainment calculation. For example, you should not include health check / keep alive transactions and you may not want to include administrative transactions. In the example below, we are looking at some of the transactions from the WebPortal service. We have decided that the about.jsp transaction is a non-business transaction that should not be tracked in our SLO attainment calculation. Example showing transaction breakdowns from the initial baseline report to help identify what to track (or not track) for SLO. Finally, import and edit the SLM template dashboard to exclude non-business transactions. Then use the p95 response time as your baseline response time service level objective. For the example chart, we chose 0.4 seconds as our response time threshold and set our service level objective to 95%. This means that we are expecting 95% of the WebPortal’s business transactions to complete in 0.4 seconds or less and without an error. The red line on the chart shows us our 95% service level objective. Example chart now excluding the non-business transactions. As you can see, there are periods of hours where the app is not meeting its SLOs. If we are going to maintain the 95% target, we would need to identify and fix the service components or dependencies that are causing these problems. Establish or optimize alerting After you have set your service level objectives, you will then configure alerts that will inform you when your SLO attainment has dipped below your goal. These alerts will show you when incidents with a high business impact are occurring. When they are triggered, they should be given a high priority and you should engage the proper teams to start the process of diagnosing the source of the problem. A basic starting point is to configure an alert that triggers when your SLO attainment has dipped under your baseline for more than 10 minutes. For more information, see our documentation on configuring alerts. Build problem resolution workflows As we’ve been discussing, the intent of the SLM process is to identify when business impacting issues occur in your IT services. When this occurs, a diagnostic investigation should be launched. The goal of the investigation is to identify what service element is causing the business impacting issue. SLM tells you that there is a problem with business impact, the diagnostic process helps you to find where the problem is. Typically, your high level diagnostic workflow will start at the service boundary and go as follows: Look at the service’s individual transactions and see which one(s) are departing from their performance and/or response time SLOs. Look at each service component responsible for delivering that transaction until you find the component that is failing. Use in-depth diagnostics to identify the root cause of the problem and then resolve it. Execute continuous improvement review This is an ongoing phase of the SLM process where data is reviewed and adjustments are made as required. Your KPIs should be reported to upper management to ensure that stakeholder teams are appropriately prioritizing work and that you are meeting the SLO goals you’ve set. Periodic KPIs should be recorded and retained over periods of months to years to establish a baseline and to show the rate of improvement. In addition, each time you execute the continuous improvement process, you should: Review each service’s architecture to ensure your instrumentation is deployed at the boundary and that there are no observabilty gaps. Review each service’s transactions to confirm that only business transactions are included in your SLO calculations. Review each service’s SLO and determine if it meets the business’s performance and quality requirements. If it does not, then the SLO should be changed and the appropriate stakeholders notified so they can work to improve performance and quality. Review your SLO attainment and determine if any upstream services should be added to the SLM process. Next steps After you’ve established the SLM process, you should identify other services that would benefit from SLM instrumentation. These may be other front-line services or upstream dependencies of services that are covered by SLOs that have shown themselves to be frequent contributors to SLO attainment failures. As you do this, you should start to measure and report your SLM coverage as a percentage of applications covered by SLOs. For example, you may say that 20% of your apps have established SLOs. As SLM expands into your organization and as its value is seen by management and other stakeholders, you may find that you need a dedicated team to manage the SLM process. The SLM process should also become a primary driver to help you prioritize issue resolution activities. SLO attainment failures are a direct indicator that your IT services are having a negative business impact which is visible to your customers as poor performance and/or unhandled errors. Value realization Once the SLM process is established, you will see a reduction in the effort required to identify business impacting issues, a better ability to communicate with your business stakeholders, and an easier time proving the business’ return on investment in IT services. Your SLM KPIs will provide quantifiable proof of these improvements. In addtion, you should be able to simplify your observability strategy by removing or reducing your dependency on legacy consumption metrics and the logic required to correlate them against your true goal of measuring performance and quality. Once you are firmly on the path to SLM's goals, consider moving to other use cases within the Uptime, Performance, and Reliability value stream, such as Service Level Management, or Reliability Engineering. You can also move to other observability maturity value streams, such as Customer Experience.",

Key performance indicators Bottom of the Funnel Analysis measures the following KPIs: KPI Description Goal Bottom of the Funnel Success Rate/Conversion Rate The rate of conversion once a user has gone far enough to demonstrate intent to complete an action to actual completion. Examples of this are rate of: Checkout -> Order submission Insurance form review -> submission Completing sign up details -> submission Increase the rate of conversion by addressing errors and latency at the bottom of the funnel Revenue at Risk due to Latency Value of a conversion * number of pages or interactions in the bottom of the funnel that are slower than the industry threshold. Focus on reducing this value by improving page KPIs Revenue at Risk due to Errors Value of a conversion * number of backend errors in the bottom of the funnel interactions Tune this value to make it meaningful by filtering out errors that aren't visible to the end user. Once this is meaningful, focus on reducing it. Create an alert to notify you if it suddenly trends upward. Prerequisites Required knowledge Familiarity with synthetic monitoring Familiarity with browser monitoring Familiarity with basic Browser UI views Familiarity with SPA data in Browser UI Required installation and configuration Browser Pro installed in relevant pages SPA enabled for single page applications Insights retention for Browser events is at least 2x an average sprint. Establish current state Identify where the Bottom of the Funnel starts The Bottom of the Funnel is focused on the final steps of a user journey where a user has gone far enough to show intent to complete the journey. Some examples: Ecommerce user journey The user journey is simplified so you can focus on where the bottom of the funnel begins - at checkout. Most users entering the checkout phase plan to purchase something. Reducing errors and latency from this point onward is more likely to improve conversions than focusing on any other part of the funnel. Car insurance purchase user journey In the example above, you have the user’s interest in car insurance as they enter information, but you do not know their intent until they see the quote and continue to proceed. Distinguish between Pages and Actions The final steps of a user’s journey is likely to be a mix of full page loads and AJAX calls. You will need to know all pages and Ajax requests for the next step. If you are not sure which requests are running from the page in question, you can run: SELECT count(*) FROM AjaxRequest WHERE pageUrl like ‘%FILTER%’ FACET groupedRequestUrl SINCE 1 DAY AGO Copy Create a scripted Synthetics Check for the Bottom of the Funnel Make sure you have a scripted monitor for each path through the bottom of the funnel. The goal is to make sure your bottom of the funnel services are working around the clock. For example, you may have a checkout flow that calls a different payment API depending on the customer’s payment preferences. Import the Bottom of the Funnel Dashboard Follow the instructions documented in the public GitHub README. Capture Current Performance Follow the GitHub repository README instructions. Use the dashboard from the previous step to understand the bottom of the funnel performance. Create a plan to improve KPIs that don’t meet target values as well as reduce revenue at risk. Improvement process Plan your work Whether you have a dedicated initiative to improve performance or classifying as ongoing maintenance, you need to track your progress at the end of every sprint. For detailed information, see: Improve uptime Improve page load performance Improve AJAX performance Advanced topics Should I apply segmentation? Segmentation (breaking out performance into cohorts, such as region and device type) is a good idea if: Your organization has initiatives tied to addressing a target audience from a particular cohort that you can segment by using either custom attributes or data that is already available in New Relic. You are already familiar with Bottom of the Funnel Analysis and there is a significant enough difference in performance among different cohorts to warrant tracking and/or developer focus. Conclusion Best practices going forward Revisit performance metrics at the end of each sprint. Any time the user journey changes, revisit if the steps at the Bottom of the Funnel are the same. Incorporate changes in developer sprints as needed. Openly share metrics with the lines of the business you support as well as other internal stakeholders. Revisit your Customer Experience SLOs. Do you need to define more ambitious SLOs for the end of the funnel? Create alerts for business critical drops in Quality Foundation KPIs.

      "body": "Overview Teams suffer from alert fatigue when they experience high alert volumes and alerts that are not aligned to business impact. As they start to believe that most alerts are false, they may prioritize easy to resolve alerts over others.  Also, they may close unresolved incidents so they can stay within their SLA targets. The result will be slower incident responses, magnified issue scope, and increased severity when true business impacting issues occur. Alert Quality Management (AQM) focuses on reducing the number of nuisance incidents so that you focus only on alerts with true business impact.  This reduces alert fatigue and ensures that you and your team focus your attention on the right places at the right times. You are a good candidate for AQM if: You have too many alerts. You have alerts that stay open for long time periods. Your alerts are not relevant. Your customers discover your issues before your monitoring tools do. You can't see the value of your observability tool(s). Desired outcome An alert strategy based on measuring business impact will result in faster response times and greater proactive awareness of critical events.  An improved alert signal to noise ratio reduces confusion and improves rapid identification and problem isolation. AQM's overall goal is to ensure that fewer, more valuable, incidents are created, resulting in: Increased uptime and availability Reduced MTTR Decreased alert volume The ability to easily identify alerts that are not valuable, so you can either make them valuable or remove them. The AQM process described in this guide generates the key performance indicators and metrics that you will use to measure progress towards these goals.  The metrics are measured in real time, published in a dashboard, and are used to drive a continuous improvement process that identifies and reduces nuisance alerts and increases user engagement in incident investigation. AQM does not encompass anomaly detection or AIOps, which are designed to detect unknown or unexpected modes of failure.  The two practices (AQM and ML/AI) work hand in hand, they are not mutually exclusive. Key performance indicators You will use the AQM process to collect and measure the following KPIs: Incident volume Incident Count Accumulated incident time Mean Time to Close (MTTC) Percent Under 5 Minutes User Engagement Mean Time to Investigate  (MTTI) % of Incidents Investigated These KPIs will help you to find the noisiest and least valuable alerts so you can improve their value or eliminate them.  You will then use the long term metric trends to show real business impact to management and stakeholders.  Detailed information on each metric follows. Incident volume You should treat incidents (with or without alerts) like a queue of tasks.  Just like a queue, the number of alerts should spend time near zero. Each incident should be a trigger for action to resolve the condition.  If an alert does not result in action, then you should question the value of the alert condition. If you see a constant rate of incidents or specific incidents that are \"always-on\", then you should question why. Are you in a constant state of business impact, or do you simply have a large volume of noise? The alert volume KPIs help you to answer those questions and to measure progress towards a healthy state of high quality alerting. Incident count KPI Incident Count is the number of incidents generated over a period of time. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. Goal: Reduce the number of low value / nuisance incidents. Best practices: Ensure condition settings are intended to detect real business impact. Ensure condition settings are detecting abnormal behavior. Communicate that the incident details \"Acknowledge\" feature helps measure meaningful and actionable alerts. See Percentage Incident Acknowledge KPI. Report AQM KPIs to all stakeholders. Accumulated incident duration KPI Accumulated incident duration is the total sum of minutes that all the incidents accumulated over a period of time. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. Goal: Reduce the total accumulated minutes of incidents. Best practices: Do not manually close incidents. Manual closure will skew the real duration of incident length. Eliminate alerts that do not result in any remediation actions from the recipients. Improve percent investigated and mean-time-to-investigate KPIs by communicating their importance in improving detection and response times. Report AQM KPIs to all Stakeholders. Mean time to close (MTTC) KPI Average duration of incidents within the period of time measured. Goal: Reduce MTTC Best practices: Do not manually close incidents. Manual closure will skew the real duration of incident length. Improve Reliability Engineering skills. Report AQM KPIs to all stakeholders. Percent under 5 minutes KPI Percentage of incidents where the duration of the incident is under five minutes. This can be an indicator of incident flapping. Goal: Minimize percentage of incidents with short durations Best practices: Ensure that conditions are detecting legitimate deviations from expected behavior. See Baselining and Service Level Management. Ensure that conditions are detecting legitimate deviations that correlate to business impact or impending business impact. User engagement You should measure the value of an incident by the amount of attention it receives.  Engagement in this context is measured by whether or not an incident has been acknowledged. The amount of engagement an individual alert receives is a direct measurement of its value.  More engagement implies a valuable alert, less (or zero) engagement implies a nuisance alert that should be modified or disabled. There is a significant difference between measuring the moment of incident awareness vs. acknowledging the moment resolution activity begins. If you are using an integration with New Relic Alerting, be sure that the \"acknowledge\" event that is sent to New Relic is triggered when resolution activity begins, not when the incident is sent to the external incident management tool.  For more information regarding the standard Incident Management process, see \"Incident Management Process: 5 Steps to Effective Resolution Posted on August 31, 2020 by OnPage Corporation. -- in reference to ITIL4\" Percentage Acknowledged KPI Incidents acknowledged identifies the percentage of incidents that have been engaged with and had their acknowledged property set to true. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. Goal: Increase the percentage of incident engagement. Best practices: Educate the DevOps team on when it is appropriate to acknowledge an incident alert. Gamify alert acknowledgement to drive usage. Discourage mass acknowledgement exercises. Mean time to investigate (MTTI) KPI Mean time to investigate identifies the average time it takes for an incident to be triaged. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. Goal: Reduce the mean time to investigate Best practices: Work at building incident responder's confidence in alerts. Ensure that valuable alerts are acknowledged. Incentivize response teams to respond quickly to alerts. Prerequisites Before you begin, if you don't have equivalent experience, complete the New Relic University (NRU) Overview Course. Also, make sure you have a basic understanding of: NR1 Alert policy and conditions configuration NR1 incident notification channel webhook configuration NR1 NRQL NR1 alerting best practices NR1 APM & Infrastructure How to baseline data in order to determine anomalies vs. normal behavior. Establish current state of your KPIs As with any continuous improvement process, the first step of AQM is to establish the current state of your KPIs. To do so, perform the following tasks: Install and configure the incident event webhook Install the AQM Dashboard Perform initial AQM orientation and enablement Accumulate AQM data Perform second enablement session Install and configure the incident event webhook The webhook will create New Relic events for each incident as it proceeds through its lifecycle (open, acknowledge, close). To ensure that the AQM process generates accurate and valuable findings, this webhook must be added as a notification channel to every alert policy. The AQM process requires incident, not violation data. This is why you will not be using the default NrAiIncident event, which provides violation data only.  Instead, you will use this webhook to send the required incident data to New Relic. To use the webhook, do the following: Identify your primary production account and each of your accounts that you will be analyzing with the AQM process. Install the incident event webhook into each account that will participate in the AQM process and configure the webhook to report nrAQMIncident events to your primary production account. Assign the webhook as a notification channel to every alert policy in each account. This example shows a webhook notification channel assigned to each alert policy for a New Relic account with multiple sub-accounts. The webhook, AQM dashboard, and detailed installation instructions can be found in the New Relic OMA resource center on GitHub. Install the AQM dashboard The AQM dashboard is the primary asset that drives the AQM process.  You need to install the AQM dashboard into the primary production account you identified in the \"Install and configure incident event webhook\" step you previously performed by doing the following: Download the dashboard definition JSON file from the New Relic OMA resource center GitHub repo. Import the definition into your primary production account. For more details on importing dashboards, see the New Relic Introduction to dashboards documentation Perform initial AQM orientation and enablement During this phase, your incident management team(s) and other stakeholders will learn the goals of the AQM process and the scope of their involvement in it. The most critical portion of this task is educating your team on the importance of acknowledging incident alerts, since that's how the alert's value is determined.  In general, instruct them to follow these guidelines: If you look at an alert and decide to take any sort of further investigative action, acknowledge the alert. If you typically close an alert without doing anything else, do not acknowledge the alert. If the incident alert is always on, do not close or acknowledge it. For further details, see Second Enablement Session. You can use the first session template presentation to communicate this material to your stakeholders. Accumulate AQM data The overall process requires at least two weeks of data before it can proceed.  During this time, you should periodically check the following items: Confirm that incident alert event data is accumulating. Confirm that the webhook is attached to every alert policy. Ensure that incident responders are following the alert acknowledgement guidelines. Perform second enablement session During this phase, you will introduce incident management teams and other stakeholders to the initial AQM data and the ongoing continuous  improvement process you'll be following. The process consists of four activities: Review AQM Dashboard and KPI Trending - Here you and the stakeholders will look at the AQM KPIs and identify their week over week trends.  The team should identify areas where KPIs are not improving and develop strategies to drive improvement. Identify Achievements, Challenges, and Opportunities - Here you and the stakeholders will map the current state of alert quality to business impact, identifying areas where improvement has resulted in better business outcomes and areas where problems are impacting business outcomes. Incident Policy Review - Using the AQM dashboard, you and the stakeholders will identify the noisiest incident policies.  Once identified, those policies should be evaluated as detailed in step 4 below. Alert Policy Recommendations - In this step, you and the stakeholders will review the noisiest policies using the following criteria: Do the alerts have any business impact? Are the policies properly configured? Are they telling us something about the resource that needs to be fixed? Are the policies necessary? (i.e. do they have business impact) Are the thresholds set properly? Technical recommendations - Here, you and the stakeholders will review any technical recommendations, including: Are there application / system problems for engineering to review? Are there poorly constructed policies that need to be fixed? Are there instrumentation gaps? You can use the second session template presentation to keep this part of the AQM process organized. Improvement process This is the ongoing phase of the continuous improvement process where you periodically review your accumulated AQM data and make adjustments as needed to alert policies. You should perform this step once a week until your alert volume is acceptable. You can then perform it less frequently. During this phase you should: Report your KPIs each week to upper management to ensure that the stakeholder teams are appropriately prioritizing the work and to show that progress towards the promised business outcomes are being reached. Record and retain your weekly KPIs  over periods of months to years to establish a baseline and to show the rate of improvement. You should keep in mind that this is a continuous improvment process, you will continue to collect and evaluate the KPIs over long periods of time to ensure you are meeting your AQM goals. Value realization Once the AQM process is established, you will see significant reductions in the volume of alerts while reliability and stability remain the same or improve.  In addition, you should see that your alerts have a clear and unambiguous business impact.  Your AQM KPIs will provide quantifiable proof of these improvements. Once you are firmly on the path to AQM's goals, consider moving to other use cases within the Uptime, Performance, and Reliability value stream, such as Service Level Management, or Reliability Engineering.  You can also move to other observability maturity value streams, such as Customer Experience. KPI reference Following are the descriptions of each KPI as well as sample NRQL queries that will extract them from the New Relic platform.  These KPIs are also included in the AQM dashboard that can be downloaded from the New Relic OMA resource center GitHub repo. Incident volume Incident count KPI Incident Count is the number of incidents generated over a period of time. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. NRQL: FROM nrAQMIncident SELECT count(*) AS 'Incident Count' WHERE current_state='open' AND severity='CRITICAL' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Accumulated incident duration KPI Accumulated incident duration is the total sum of minutes that all the incidents accumulated over a period of time.

This can be an indicator of incident flapping.

      "body": "Overview IT Operations is expected to provide services that meet the business’s requirements for performance and reliability. However, many ops teams attempt to measure performace and reliability using legacy methods, like measuring resource consumption. That, in turn, requires that they create complex dashboards of granular metrics which they then try to correlate with application performance and reliability. These complex dashboards require subject matter experts to interpret the results for business stakeholders. Legacy methods create barriers to understanding what a good system state looks like and how bad system states impact the business. Essentially, IT ends up not sharing a common metric vocabulary with the business. This fundamental disconnect will result in the perception that IT is not able to deliver the services that the business requires, with all the implications and impacts that perception carries. Service Level Management (SLM) eliminates that disconnect by better explaining the overall performance of a system in terms that are easily understood by both IT and the business. The intent is to show whether or not the system is meeting its performance and reliability expectations, and if it is trending toward or away from improvement, so proactive steps can be taken. The end goal is that systems are better oriented toward desired business outcomes with IT’s attention focused on issues in areas with the highest business impact. You are a good candidate for SLM if any of the following are true: The business impact of performance and reliability issues are not well understood by all stakeholders. Your MTTx is too high. You are collecting many resource consumption metrics (such as CPU, disk, or memory) or are maintaining many metric correlation rules in order to identify system problems. You can’t see the value of your observability tool(s). Desired outcome Service Level Management’s overall goal is to easily measure and communicate the overall health, performance, and quality of your digital products and services to all stakeholders. By implementing SLM at key output points in your systems, you will have a simpler and more responsive observability practice, tighter alignment with the business, and faster paths to improvement. The SLM process described in this guide will help you to identify the points in your systems where you should measure the key performance metrics of service performance and quality. It will also define and drive a simpler alerting strategy, continuous improvement methodologies, and improved problem resolution workflows. Key performance indicators You will use the SLM process to collect and measure the following KPIs, often referred to as the “Golden Signals”: Service Response Time Service Quality (error rate) Service Level Objective Attainment (Availability) Service Uptime These KPIs directly measure the most important aspects of an IT service, speed and quality, in a way that is easy and intuitive to understand and communicate to technical and non-technical stakeholders. Detailed information on each metric follows. Service response time KPI Service response time measures the amount of time a service requires to process a transaction. It starts when a transaction request is received by the service and ends when the response is sent. Goal: Reduce transaction response time. Best practices: Measure response time at service boundaries. Use continuous improvement processes to drive down response times. Ensure that non-business transactions (i.e. health checks) are not included / measured. Map this KPI back to business impact. Report KPIs to all stakeholders. Service quality KPI Service quality is the number of transactions that result in an unhandled error. Typically, these are transactions whose HTTP response code is greater than or equal to 400. Goal: Reduce the number of unhandled errors. Best practices: Measure error rates at service boundaries. Continually identify and remediate sources of high error volumes. Map this KPI back to business impact. Report KPIs to all stakeholders. Service level objective attainment KPI SLO attainment is the percentage of time a business service is meeting its response time and quality goals. Goal: Improve response time and quality to ensure high SLO attainment. Best practices: Use continuous improvement processes to maintain / improve SLO attainment. Map this KPI back to business impact. Report KPIs to all stakeholders. Service uptime KPI Service uptime is the percentage of time a service can be reached by at least one client. Typically this is measured using synthetic transactions from representative remote locations. Goal: Use continuous improvement processes to watch uptime metrics and take appropriate steps to ensure uptime meets business requirements. Best practices: Use continuous improvement processes to maintain / improve SLO attainment. Map this KPI back to business impact Report KPIs to all stakeholders. Prerequisites Before you begin, if you don’t have equivalent experience, you should complete the New Relic University (NRU) Overview Course. You should also have a basic understanding of: New Relic One APM and infrastructure monitoring New Relic One Dashboards and NRQL New Relic One alerting best practices Establish current state of your KPIs As with any continuous improvement process, the first step of SLM is to establish the current state of your KPIs. To do so, you will need to perform the following tasks: Determine in-scope services Identify service boundaries Deploy instrumentation Perform SLM educational workshops Analyze KPIs and set baseline SLOs Establish / Optimize Alerting Build problem resolution workflows Execute continuous improvement review To help illustrate this process, we are going to apply it to an example IT service, an ecommerce site for a cellular telephone provider. Determine in-scope services You should first identify the IT services that are going to be in-scope for the initial iteration of the SLM process. These services should be key to ongoing business operations and as close to your customers as possible. Most commonly, you will be applying the SLM process to an application, since that is the service your customers are expecting you to deliver. SLM can be applied to infrastructure-based services; however, it is a more advanced application of SLM which is applicable to a much smaller set of organizations. If you are considering implementing SLM for infrastructure, you should ensure that the service(s) you are instrumenting are actually the closest to your organization’s end-customer. If your infrastructure is hosting a customer-facing app, then the app should be the target of SLM. Absent anything else, a good methodology for identifying in-scope services is to consult your disaster recovery plan. Typically, the most critical business services are prioritized there. Identify service boundaries Next, you should identify each service’s boundary, which is the service component that is closest to the client sending transaction requests. This should be the application receiving the request from the client, browser, or mobile device, and may also be known as the \"external API.\" Reverse proxies, CDNs, and load balancers are not part of the service boundary. Their service level compliance should be measured via the Uptime KPI (external test requests for connectivity). If your services are using APM, you can identify service boundaries using the service map or dependencies features. A service component is on a boundary if it has no inbound connections. In the example below (from a service map), you can see that the WebPortal is on the boundary. An example of using service maps in New Relic One to identify service boundaries. In contrast, the following screenshot (from the dependencies page) shows that the Inventory Service is not on a boundary since it has incoming connections from the WebPortal. Subsequent examples in this guide will build on the WebPortal service boundary. An example of using the dependencies UI in New Relic One to identify service boundaries. You should understand that the SLM process defines a service boundary as being downstream of any dependencies. The service boundary is the point where all the effects and impacts of dependent services are measured as they contribute to the total response time and quality of the service. By measuring service level compliance at the boundary, you will be able to see the impact that all service components upstream of the boundary have on service delivery. This means that your initial steps into SLM can focus on the services that are closest to your users, yet still capture the contribution of more distant services. As your practice matures, you will be able to identify the next round of upstream services that would benefit from direct SLM instrumentation. In our example, the WebService is downstream of the Fulfillment, Plan, Promo, Login, and Inventory services (among others). By applying SLM at the WebService, we will be seeing the impact of the upstream services on the WebService. Any impactful issues with an upstream service will be reflected in the WebService’s service level KPIs. By instrumenting one service, we are capturing the contribution of five additional services. This greatly simplifies our observability practice. In time, problematic upstream services will self-identify themselves as candidates for direct SLM instrumentation. Deploy instrumentation To collect SLM service response time and transaction success KPIs, you need to deploy instrumentation into the components of your production apps on the service boundary. If you don’t have instrumentation that can do this in production already, then you will need to engage the teams and stakeholders that can help you to get this done. For detailed information on deploying the New Relic instrumentation that can gather this information, see our APM install documentation. The uptime KPIs can be collected using synthetic transactions, which don’t require any instrumentation to be added to the service. If needed, you can start your SLM journey there while waiting for the direct instrumentation to be deployed. The uptime tests should perform a basic, yet realistic, check of the service’s functionality. For detailed information on this capability, see our synthetic monitoring documentation. Perform SLM educational workshops You should share the self-paced New Relic Essentials training course with the appropriate stakeholders so they can understand how the New Relic technology platform will aid in the SLM process. Analyze KPIs and set baseline SLOs The SLM process uses speed and quality as its key performance indicators. In technical terms, speed means response time and quality means error rate. At the end of this phase, you will have created baseline service level objectives for each service in the form of a percentage. For example: “98% of service X’s transactions will be error free and occur in less than 500 milliseconds.” For each in-scope service, you should analyze speed and quality at the service boundary. This will give you an overall understanding of how the entire service and all of its dependencies are performing. As you iterate through the SLM process, you can then identify and prioritize the upstream service components that require direct SLM instrumentation. To analyze KPIs, you should do the following for each service: Identify the volume and 95th percentile response time for each of the service’s transactions over a relatively long period of time, typically between seven days and one month. It is important that you use percentile rather than average, so you can see the entire range of response times, including outliers. If you use averages, you will hide outliers. The following is an example of the initial baseline report. Here you can see the volume, p95 response time, and error volume for the WebPortal and a few other services. The WebPortal’s p95 response time is .36 seconds (or 36 milliseconds), so we have decided to set the SLO target to 0.4 seconds. Example of an initial baseline report measuring volume and 95th percentile response time. Next you should review and identify any non-business transactions, since they should not be included in the SLO attainment calculation. For example, you should not include health check / keep alive transactions and you may not want to include administrative transactions. In the example below, we are looking at some of the transactions from the WebPortal service. We have decided that the about.jsp transaction is a non-business transaction that should not be tracked in our SLO attainment calculation. Example showing transaction breakdowns from the initial baseline report to help identify what to track (or not track) for SLO. Finally, import and edit the SLM template dashboard to exclude non-business transactions. Then use the p95 response time as your baseline response time service level objective. For the example chart, we chose 0.4 seconds as our response time threshold and set our service level objective to 95%. This means that we are expecting 95% of the WebPortal’s business transactions to complete in 0.4 seconds or less and without an error. The red line on the chart shows us our 95% service level objective. Example chart now excluding the non-business transactions. As you can see, there are periods of hours where the app is not meeting its SLOs. If we are going to maintain the 95% target, we would need to identify and fix the service components or dependencies that are causing these problems. Establish or optimize alerting After you have set your service level objectives, you will then configure alerts that will inform you when your SLO attainment has dipped below your goal. These alerts will show you when incidents with a high business impact are occurring. When they are triggered, they should be given a high priority and you should engage the proper teams to start the process of diagnosing the source of the problem. A basic starting point is to configure an alert that triggers when your SLO attainment has dipped under your baseline for more than 10 minutes. For more information, see our documentation on configuring alerts. Build problem resolution workflows As we’ve been discussing, the intent of the SLM process is to identify when business impacting issues occur in your IT services. When this occurs, a diagnostic investigation should be launched. The goal of the investigation is to identify what service element is causing the business impacting issue. SLM tells you that there is a problem with business impact, the diagnostic process helps you to find where the problem is. Typically, your high level diagnostic workflow will start at the service boundary and go as follows: Look at the service’s individual transactions and see which one(s) are departing from their performance and/or response time SLOs. Look at each service component responsible for delivering that transaction until you find the component that is failing. Use in-depth diagnostics to identify the root cause of the problem and then resolve it. Execute continuous improvement review This is an ongoing phase of the SLM process where data is reviewed and adjustments are made as required. Your KPIs should be reported to upper management to ensure that stakeholder teams are appropriately prioritizing work and that you are meeting the SLO goals you’ve set. Periodic KPIs should be recorded and retained over periods of months to years to establish a baseline and to show the rate of improvement. In addition, each time you execute the continuous improvement process, you should: Review each service’s architecture to ensure your instrumentation is deployed at the boundary and that there are no observabilty gaps. Review each service’s transactions to confirm that only business transactions are included in your SLO calculations. Review each service’s SLO and determine if it meets the business’s performance and quality requirements. If it does not, then the SLO should be changed and the appropriate stakeholders notified so they can work to improve performance and quality. Review your SLO attainment and determine if any upstream services should be added to the SLM process. Next steps After you’ve established the SLM process, you should identify other services that would benefit from SLM instrumentation. These may be other front-line services or upstream dependencies of services that are covered by SLOs that have shown themselves to be frequent contributors to SLO attainment failures. As you do this, you should start to measure and report your SLM coverage as a percentage of applications covered by SLOs. For example, you may say that 20% of your apps have established SLOs. As SLM expands into your organization and as its value is seen by management and other stakeholders, you may find that you need a dedicated team to manage the SLM process. The SLM process should also become a primary driver to help you prioritize issue resolution activities. SLO attainment failures are a direct indicator that your IT services are having a negative business impact which is visible to your customers as poor performance and/or unhandled errors. Value realization Once the SLM process is established, you will see a reduction in the effort required to identify business impacting issues, a better ability to communicate with your business stakeholders, and an easier time proving the business’ return on investment in IT services. Your SLM KPIs will provide quantifiable proof of these improvements. In addtion, you should be able to simplify your observability strategy by removing or reducing your dependency on legacy consumption metrics and the logic required to correlate them against your true goal of measuring performance and quality. Once you are firmly on the path to SLM's goals, consider moving to other use cases within the Uptime, Performance, and Reliability value stream, such as Service Level Management, or Reliability Engineering. You can also move to other observability maturity value streams, such as Customer Experience.",

      "body": "Overview Digital customer experience is your end user’s experience across all your digital touch points. There are four core factors that impact a user’s experience: Availability (Is it reachable?) Performance (Does it perform well enough to be usable?) Content quality (Does it have what users need and can they find it?) Product and content relevance (Does it have what users care about?) Digital customer experience includes web, mobile, and IoT. The first version of this guide is focused on measuring the end user web experience. Quality Foundation is about creating a standard practice to help you understand your digital customer experience in a meaningful way. Desired Outcome This implementation guide will help you: Look at customer experience in relation to: Global functions, such as search and login Lines of business Regions Report back to business stakeholders on what they care about Prioritize what you work on Create a repeatable practice Key Performance Indicators Quality Foundation measures the following KPIs: JavaScript error rate KPI This KPI measures the number of JavaScript errors per page view. Goal: Remove irrelevant JavaScript errors being tracked either by tuning ingest or using filtering. Reduce JavaScript errors that impact customer performance. HTTP error rate KPI HTTP errors (or HTTP 4xx and 5xx responses) happen when calls to the backend are not successful. Goal: Measure and reduce the HTTP error rate to ensure your customers are able to do what they came to your site to do. Time to first byte KPI This KPI measures the time from navigation start (a user clicking a link) to the browser receiving the first byte of the response from the server. Goal: Reduce the time to first byte by improving CDN, network, and service performance. Core web vitals: Largest contentful paint (LCP) KPI Core Web Vitals are part of Google’s Page Experience Metrics. They measure the experience from when a page begins rendering. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) measures the time it takes to load the largest image after a user has navigated to a new page. Goal: Reduce LCP to 2.5 seconds or better for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Reduce FID to 100 milliseconds or better for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Core web vitals: First input delay (FID) KPI This KPI measures the experience from when a page begins rendering. Goal: Reduce FID to 100 milliseconds or better for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Cumulative layout shift (CLS) KPI This KPI measures how much the page layout shifts during render. Goal: Maintain a score of 0.1 or less for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Prerequisites Required knowledge Familiarity with synthetic monitoring Familiarity with browser monitoring Familiarity with basic Browser UI views Familiarity with SPA data in Browser UI Required Installation and Configuration Browser Pro installed in all pages SPA enabled for single page applications Synthetics monitors configured: Ping monitors configured for anonymous users Scripted synthetics check configured for login flow Monitors should be configured to test from all regions applicable to your users Monitors should be configured for each domain and each login flow Data retention for browser events is at least 2x an average sprint. Establish current state Review Instrumented Pages Review Browser apps and pages to make sure that everything you expect to report back to New Relic is. You can do this by reviewing the Page Views tab in the Browser UI or running the following query: SELECT uniques(pageUrl) from PageView LIMIT MAX Copy You may need to filter out URLs that contain request or customer ID. Validate Browser URL Grouping Ensure Browser segments are captured correctly so user experience performance is measurable in both the NewRelic UI as well as at the aggregate level when querying via NRQL. A segment is the text between two / in a URL or between . of a domain name. For example, in the URL website.com/product/widget-name, the segments are: website .com product widget-name When there are a lot of URLs with a lot of segments, URLs can get crushed, so that website.com/product/widget-name becomes website.com/ or website.com/product/. In this example, the first crushed URL is not particularly useful, but the second one may be a useful way of aggregating customer experience data for the product. Not sure whether you need to tune your configuration? Import the Segment Allow List Investigation dashboard in GitHub to help. Once you’ve identified which segments to add, you can add them using Segment allow lists in Browser. Understand How You Will Segment Your Data Make Customer Experience data understandable and actionable by breaking it out into different segments. In this case, segments refer to groups of data. It does not refer to sections of URLs, as in segment allow lists. Consider the following statements: Most of our users experience 3 seconds or better to first input delay. On average, we see 2 seconds to the largest contentful paint. Last week, there were 1 million page views. Compared to: Most of the users in the US, Canada, and EMEA experience 2 seconds or better to first input delay. Malaysia and Indonesia users experience 4 seconds; we are looking into this. Customers buying car insurance typically see 1 second to largest contentful paint. For home insurance, it’s 4 seconds. Last week, there were 700,000 page views on mobile browser apps compared to 300,000 on desktop. Let’s make sure we’re optimizing our mobile experience. Typical segmentation involves breaking down user experience into the following categories: Segment Guidance Region/Location Basic: Group by country. Browser events automatically contain the country code of requests, so there is nothing you need to do to break it out further. Advanced: Make regional grouping match regional SLO groups by creating your own region attribute using custom attributes in Browser. Facet by countryCode. Related attributes: regionCode city asnLatitude asnLongitude Device Break out performance and engagement device type so you can understand: Typical breakdown of desktop vs mobile browser users Experience of desktop vs mobile browser users Facet by deviceType. Related attributes: userAgentName userAgentOS userAgentVersion Product/Line of Business In this scenario, a product is a separate line of business or service provided by your organization. Some examples of industries and respective products: An insurance company that sells both car and house insurance A media company that has multiple streaming services or channels A travel company that provides car rental as well as hotel bookings Basic: Break out performance by product by: Faceting on pageUrl: Use this approach when multiple products are grouped into one browser app in New Relic. Faceting by appName: Use this approach when each product is instrumented as a separate web app. Grouping by appName and then facet: Use this approach when there are multiple apps in browser supporting one product. Advanced: Add product offering as a custom attribute to browser pages using custom attributes. Environment During instrumentation or afterwards, follow a naming convention that specifies the environment in Browser. Well named browser apps specify product and/or function as well as environment. Examples: account-management.prod hotels-book.prod car-insurance.uat Using app naming conventions to specify the environment supports filtering data in both the UI and in dashboards. For more information, see the documentation for how to rename Browser apps. Team In some organizations, a single team supports multiple products, while in others, a product is big enough to be supported by multiple teams. Report on team performance against customer experience or engagement by either adding the team name to the Browser app name (for example, account-management.prod.unicorn-squad) or by using custom attributes. Import the Quality Foundation Dashboard This step creates the dashboard that you will use to measure your customer experience and improve it. Clone the GitHub repository. Follow the GitHub repository README instructions to implement the dashboard. Make sure to align the dashboard to lines of business or customer facing offerings rather than teams. This ensures optimization time is spent where it is most impactful. Capture Current Performance For Each Dashboard Page Follow the GitHub README instructions. Use the dashboard from the previous step to understand the overall performance for each line of business. If relevant, apply filters to see performance across region or device. If values drop below targets and it matters, add it to the sheet as a candidate for improvement. Not worth tracking: A company that sells insurance in the US only notices poor performance in Malaysia. Worth tracking: A company that sells insurance in the US only notices poor performance with respect to mobile users in the US. Improvement Process Plan your work Whether you have a dedicated initiative to improve performance or classifying as ongoing maintenance, you need to track your progress at the end of every sprint. Decide which KPIs to Improve You now know what your user experience looks like across multiple lines of business. Where should you be improving? Start with business priorities. If you have clear business directives or have access to a senior manager above who does, you should focus on what matters most to your organization. For example, let’s say your company has recently launched a new initiative around a line of business but the KPIs associated with the UI are below target. This is where you should focus time initially. Next, focus on KPIs for each line of business. Finally, filter each line of business by device, region, etc., to see if additional focus is needed for specific regions or devices. Improve Targeted KPIs To track your progress, create a new dashboard or add a new page to the existing dashboard and name it Quality Foundation KPI Improvement. For more information, see Improve Web Uptime. Improve Page Load Performance Narrow your focus to specific pages that aren’t meeting target KPI values. For each page load KPI result that is out of bounds in the Quality Foundation Dashboard, remove the COMPARE WITH clause and add FACET pageUrl/targetGroupedUrl LIMIT MAX to find which pages are the poor performers. Use targetGroupedUrl when there are many results; for example, when the customer ID is part of the URL. Otherwise, use pageUrl. Original Dashboard query: FROM PageViewTiming SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) WHERE appName ='WebPortal' AND pageUrl LIKE '%phone%' SINCE 1 week AGO COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO Copy New query to identify problem pages: FROM PageViewTiming SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) WHERE appName ='WebPortal' AND pageUrl LIKE '%phone%' FACET targetGroupedUrl LIMIT MAX Copy Once you have identified which pages to improve, improve them following these best practices. Improve AJAX Response Times Find the slow requests. Go to the Ajax duration widget on the dashboard. View query, then open in query builder. Add facet requestUrl LIMIT MAX to the end of the query. Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - AjaxResponseTimes. Focus improving requests with a timeToSettle > 2.5s. Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to improve response times. See AJAX troubleshooting tips. Improve the AJAX Error Rate Find the failing requests. Go to Dashboards > Query builder. Enter FROM AjaxRequest SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode >= 400) WHERE httpResponseCode >= 200 AND <Ajax Request filter> SINCE 1 week AGO facet pageUrl, appName Copy Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - Pages with AjaxErrors. Run the query again for the most problematic pages to find the requests that are failing: FROM AjaxRequest SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode >= 400) WHERE httpResponseCode >= 200 AND pageUrl=<problematic page> AND appName = <corresponding app> <Ajax Request filter> SINCE 1 week AGO facet requestUrl Copy Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to improve response times. See AJAX troubleshooting tips. Improve Javascript Errors Find the most common failures. Go to Dashboards > Query builder Enter FROM JavaScriptError SELECT count(errorClass) SINCE 1 week AGO WHERE <PageView filter> FACET transactionName, errorClass, errorMessage, domain Copy Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - Javascript Errors. Use this information to figure out which errors need to be addressed Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to resolve errors that need addressing. See JavaScript errors page: Detect and analyze errors. Remove third party errors that do not add value. You may be using a third party JavaScript that is noisy but works as expected. You can take a couple of approaches: Remove the domain name from the JavaScript error/Pageview ratio widget and add it as its own widget so you can see unexpected changes. You can alert on this using Baseline NRQL alerts. Drop the JavaScript error using drop filters. Only use this option if the volume of errors is impacting your data ingest in a significant way. Be as specific as you can in the drop filter. Conclusion Best practices going forward: Revisit performance metrics (shared in this document as Quality Foundation KPIs) at the end of each sprint. Incorporate performance improvements into developer sprints. Openly share metrics with the lines of the business you support as well as other internal stakeholders. Define Customer Experience SLOs. Create alerts for business critical drops in Quality Foundation KPIs. Value Realization: At the end of this process you should now: Have an understanding of your end user experience in a way that is tangible, actionable, and easy for engineers as well as the business to understand. Know how releases impact your end customers. Know how your customers are impacted by service, infrastructure, or network level events. See latency issues caused by backend services if they exist. Have created, or be on the path to create, a common language with business owners so you are working together. This can open new avenues for recognition and sponsorship for new projects.",

      "body": "Overview IT Operations is expected to provide services that meet the business’s requirements for performance and reliability. However, many ops teams attempt to measure performace and reliability using legacy methods, like measuring resource consumption. That, in turn, requires that they create complex dashboards of granular metrics which they then try to correlate with application performance and reliability. These complex dashboards require subject matter experts to interpret the results for business stakeholders. Legacy methods create barriers to understanding what a good system state looks like and how bad system states impact the business. Essentially, IT ends up not sharing a common metric vocabulary with the business. This fundamental disconnect will result in the perception that IT is not able to deliver the services that the business requires, with all the implications and impacts that perception carries. Service Level Management (SLM) eliminates that disconnect by better explaining the overall performance of a system in terms that are easily understood by both IT and the business. The intent is to show whether or not the system is meeting its performance and reliability expectations, and if it is trending toward or away from improvement, so proactive steps can be taken. The end goal is that systems are better oriented toward desired business outcomes with IT’s attention focused on issues in areas with the highest business impact. You are a good candidate for SLM if any of the following are true: The business impact of performance and reliability issues are not well understood by all stakeholders. Your MTTx is too high. You are collecting many resource consumption metrics (such as CPU, disk, or memory) or are maintaining many metric correlation rules in order to identify system problems. You can’t see the value of your observability tool(s). Desired outcome Service Level Management’s overall goal is to easily measure and communicate the overall health, performance, and quality of your digital products and services to all stakeholders. By implementing SLM at key output points in your systems, you will have a simpler and more responsive observability practice, tighter alignment with the business, and faster paths to improvement. The SLM process described in this guide will help you to identify the points in your systems where you should measure the key performance metrics of service performance and quality. It will also define and drive a simpler alerting strategy, continuous improvement methodologies, and improved problem resolution workflows. Key performance indicators You will use the SLM process to collect and measure the following KPIs, often referred to as the “Golden Signals”: Service Response Time Service Quality (error rate) Service Level Objective Attainment (Availability) Service Uptime These KPIs directly measure the most important aspects of an IT service, speed and quality, in a way that is easy and intuitive to understand and communicate to technical and non-technical stakeholders. Detailed information on each metric follows. Service response time KPI Service response time measures the amount of time a service requires to process a transaction. It starts when a transaction request is received by the service and ends when the response is sent. Goal: Reduce transaction response time. Best practices: Measure response time at service boundaries. Use continuous improvement processes to drive down response times. Ensure that non-business transactions (i.e. health checks) are not included / measured. Map this KPI back to business impact. Report KPIs to all stakeholders. Service quality KPI Service quality is the number of transactions that result in an unhandled error. Typically, these are transactions whose HTTP response code is greater than or equal to 400. Goal: Reduce the number of unhandled errors. Best practices: Measure error rates at service boundaries. Continually identify and remediate sources of high error volumes. Map this KPI back to business impact. Report KPIs to all stakeholders. Service level objective attainment KPI SLO attainment is the percentage of time a business service is meeting its response time and quality goals. Goal: Improve response time and quality to ensure high SLO attainment. Best practices: Use continuous improvement processes to maintain / improve SLO attainment. Map this KPI back to business impact. Report KPIs to all stakeholders. Service uptime KPI Service uptime is the percentage of time a service can be reached by at least one client. Typically this is measured using synthetic transactions from representative remote locations. Goal: Use continuous improvement processes to watch uptime metrics and take appropriate steps to ensure uptime meets business requirements. Best practices: Use continuous improvement processes to maintain / improve SLO attainment. Map this KPI back to business impact Report KPIs to all stakeholders. Prerequisites Before you begin, if you don’t have equivalent experience, you should complete the New Relic University (NRU) Overview Course. You should also have a basic understanding of: New Relic One APM and infrastructure monitoring New Relic One Dashboards and NRQL New Relic One alerting best practices Establish current state of your KPIs As with any continuous improvement process, the first step of SLM is to establish the current state of your KPIs. To do so, you will need to perform the following tasks: Determine in-scope services Identify service boundaries Deploy instrumentation Perform SLM educational workshops Analyze KPIs and set baseline SLOs Establish / Optimize Alerting Build problem resolution workflows Execute continuous improvement review To help illustrate this process, we are going to apply it to an example IT service, an ecommerce site for a cellular telephone provider. Determine in-scope services You should first identify the IT services that are going to be in-scope for the initial iteration of the SLM process. These services should be key to ongoing business operations and as close to your customers as possible. Most commonly, you will be applying the SLM process to an application, since that is the service your customers are expecting you to deliver. SLM can be applied to infrastructure-based services; however, it is a more advanced application of SLM which is applicable to a much smaller set of organizations. If you are considering implementing SLM for infrastructure, you should ensure that the service(s) you are instrumenting are actually the closest to your organization’s end-customer. If your infrastructure is hosting a customer-facing app, then the app should be the target of SLM. Absent anything else, a good methodology for identifying in-scope services is to consult your disaster recovery plan. Typically, the most critical business services are prioritized there. Identify service boundaries Next, you should identify each service’s boundary, which is the service component that is closest to the client sending transaction requests. This should be the application receiving the request from the client, browser, or mobile device, and may also be known as the \"external API.\" Reverse proxies, CDNs, and load balancers are not part of the service boundary. Their service level compliance should be measured via the Uptime KPI (external test requests for connectivity). If your services are using APM, you can identify service boundaries using the service map or dependencies features. A service component is on a boundary if it has no inbound connections. In the example below (from a service map), you can see that the WebPortal is on the boundary. An example of using service maps in New Relic One to identify service boundaries. In contrast, the following screenshot (from the dependencies page) shows that the Inventory Service is not on a boundary since it has incoming connections from the WebPortal. Subsequent examples in this guide will build on the WebPortal service boundary. An example of using the dependencies UI in New Relic One to identify service boundaries. You should understand that the SLM process defines a service boundary as being downstream of any dependencies. The service boundary is the point where all the effects and impacts of dependent services are measured as they contribute to the total response time and quality of the service. By measuring service level compliance at the boundary, you will be able to see the impact that all service components upstream of the boundary have on service delivery. This means that your initial steps into SLM can focus on the services that are closest to your users, yet still capture the contribution of more distant services. As your practice matures, you will be able to identify the next round of upstream services that would benefit from direct SLM instrumentation. In our example, the WebService is downstream of the Fulfillment, Plan, Promo, Login, and Inventory services (among others). By applying SLM at the WebService, we will be seeing the impact of the upstream services on the WebService. Any impactful issues with an upstream service will be reflected in the WebService’s service level KPIs. By instrumenting one service, we are capturing the contribution of five additional services. This greatly simplifies our observability practice. In time, problematic upstream services will self-identify themselves as candidates for direct SLM instrumentation. Deploy instrumentation To collect SLM service response time and transaction success KPIs, you need to deploy instrumentation into the components of your production apps on the service boundary. If you don’t have instrumentation that can do this in production already, then you will need to engage the teams and stakeholders that can help you to get this done. For detailed information on deploying the New Relic instrumentation that can gather this information, see our APM install documentation. The uptime KPIs can be collected using synthetic transactions, which don’t require any instrumentation to be added to the service. If needed, you can start your SLM journey there while waiting for the direct instrumentation to be deployed. The uptime tests should perform a basic, yet realistic, check of the service’s functionality. For detailed information on this capability, see our synthetic monitoring documentation. Perform SLM educational workshops You should share the self-paced New Relic Essentials training course with the appropriate stakeholders so they can understand how the New Relic technology platform will aid in the SLM process. Analyze KPIs and set baseline SLOs The SLM process uses speed and quality as its key performance indicators. In technical terms, speed means response time and quality means error rate. At the end of this phase, you will have created baseline service level objectives for each service in the form of a percentage. For example: “98% of service X’s transactions will be error free and occur in less than 500 milliseconds.” For each in-scope service, you should analyze speed and quality at the service boundary. This will give you an overall understanding of how the entire service and all of its dependencies are performing. As you iterate through the SLM process, you can then identify and prioritize the upstream service components that require direct SLM instrumentation. To analyze KPIs, you should do the following for each service: Identify the volume and 95th percentile response time for each of the service’s transactions over a relatively long period of time, typically between seven days and one month. It is important that you use percentile rather than average, so you can see the entire range of response times, including outliers. If you use averages, you will hide outliers. The following is an example of the initial baseline report. Here you can see the volume, p95 response time, and error volume for the WebPortal and a few other services. The WebPortal’s p95 response time is .36 seconds (or 36 milliseconds), so we have decided to set the SLO target to 0.4 seconds. Example of an initial baseline report measuring volume and 95th percentile response time. Next you should review and identify any non-business transactions, since they should not be included in the SLO attainment calculation. For example, you should not include health check / keep alive transactions and you may not want to include administrative transactions. In the example below, we are looking at some of the transactions from the WebPortal service. We have decided that the about.jsp transaction is a non-business transaction that should not be tracked in our SLO attainment calculation. Example showing transaction breakdowns from the initial baseline report to help identify what to track (or not track) for SLO. Finally, import and edit the SLM template dashboard to exclude non-business transactions. Then use the p95 response time as your baseline response time service level objective. For the example chart, we chose 0.4 seconds as our response time threshold and set our service level objective to 95%. This means that we are expecting 95% of the WebPortal’s business transactions to complete in 0.4 seconds or less and without an error. The red line on the chart shows us our 95% service level objective. Example chart now excluding the non-business transactions. As you can see, there are periods of hours where the app is not meeting its SLOs. If we are going to maintain the 95% target, we would need to identify and fix the service components or dependencies that are causing these problems. Establish or optimize alerting After you have set your service level objectives, you will then configure alerts that will inform you when your SLO attainment has dipped below your goal. These alerts will show you when incidents with a high business impact are occurring. When they are triggered, they should be given a high priority and you should engage the proper teams to start the process of diagnosing the source of the problem. A basic starting point is to configure an alert that triggers when your SLO attainment has dipped under your baseline for more than 10 minutes. For more information, see our documentation on configuring alerts. Build problem resolution workflows As we’ve been discussing, the intent of the SLM process is to identify when business impacting issues occur in your IT services. When this occurs, a diagnostic investigation should be launched. The goal of the investigation is to identify what service element is causing the business impacting issue. SLM tells you that there is a problem with business impact, the diagnostic process helps you to find where the problem is. Typically, your high level diagnostic workflow will start at the service boundary and go as follows: Look at the service’s individual transactions and see which one(s) are departing from their performance and/or response time SLOs. Look at each service component responsible for delivering that transaction until you find the component that is failing. Use in-depth diagnostics to identify the root cause of the problem and then resolve it. Execute continuous improvement review This is an ongoing phase of the SLM process where data is reviewed and adjustments are made as required. Your KPIs should be reported to upper management to ensure that stakeholder teams are appropriately prioritizing work and that you are meeting the SLO goals you’ve set. Periodic KPIs should be recorded and retained over periods of months to years to establish a baseline and to show the rate of improvement. In addition, each time you execute the continuous improvement process, you should: Review each service’s architecture to ensure your instrumentation is deployed at the boundary and that there are no observabilty gaps. Review each service’s transactions to confirm that only business transactions are included in your SLO calculations. Review each service’s SLO and determine if it meets the business’s performance and quality requirements. If it does not, then the SLO should be changed and the appropriate stakeholders notified so they can work to improve performance and quality. Review your SLO attainment and determine if any upstream services should be added to the SLM process. Next steps After you’ve established the SLM process, you should identify other services that would benefit from SLM instrumentation. These may be other front-line services or upstream dependencies of services that are covered by SLOs that have shown themselves to be frequent contributors to SLO attainment failures. As you do this, you should start to measure and report your SLM coverage as a percentage of applications covered by SLOs. For example, you may say that 20% of your apps have established SLOs. As SLM expands into your organization and as its value is seen by management and other stakeholders, you may find that you need a dedicated team to manage the SLM process. The SLM process should also become a primary driver to help you prioritize issue resolution activities. SLO attainment failures are a direct indicator that your IT services are having a negative business impact which is visible to your customers as poor performance and/or unhandled errors. Value realization Once the SLM process is established, you will see a reduction in the effort required to identify business impacting issues, a better ability to communicate with your business stakeholders, and an easier time proving the business’ return on investment in IT services. Your SLM KPIs will provide quantifiable proof of these improvements. In addtion, you should be able to simplify your observability strategy by removing or reducing your dependency on legacy consumption metrics and the logic required to correlate them against your true goal of measuring performance and quality. Once you are firmly on the path to SLM's goals, consider moving to other use cases within the Uptime, Performance, and Reliability value stream, such as Service Level Management, or Reliability Engineering. You can also move to other observability maturity value streams, such as Customer Experience.",

      "body": "Overview \"Do I have all the telemetry I need to adequately measure my service?\" The process of onboarding a service for production monitoring tends to start from the end and work its way to the beginning. Typically a completed service is instantiated with agent based monitoring and the team responsible for service delivery needs to read the telemetry coming out of the agent like tea leaves, working their way backward to understand how the service functions by what can be observed. At New Relic, through tens of thousands of observability deployments, we have discovered that the more involved designers, architects, and developers can be in the definition of optimal service delivery measurement, the better. The emergence of the IT aphorism shift left speaks to the need to involve developers more directly in the software lifecycle activities that happen after the development stage is complete. In the case of service observability, we find there is little specific guidance on how developers can meaningfully contribute to production telemetry definitions. This guide is intended to provide practical suggestions for service developers to evaluate the state of your telemetry and suggest paths to improve it. Observability programs that closely link developer expectations with the runtime behavior of production systems are much more effective to diagnose and remediate aberrant conditions. The closer developer connection also produces services that are more robust and performant. You’re a good candidate for service characterization if any of the following are true: Your development teams are disconnected from production observability design. Your production monitoring program suffers from a lag between the introduction of new services/capabilities and their coverage with telemetry and alerting. You need to provide additional business context to your instrumentation for diagnosis and business KPI measurement. You employ a highly customized or proprietary software framework. Your service is under active development. Legacy services, and services built from commercial-off-the-shelf platforms tend to be better served with generic instrumentation options. Desired outcome This guide focuses on the metrics derived from your service’s runtime operation (its code execution) as well as external measurements of execution (through synthetic testing). Service instrumentation planning is the approach used to describe a single service runtime through telemetry. Modern monitoring systems provide deep insight into the technical details of service implementation. The power of distributed trace or bytecode instrumentation allows operations teams to quickly collect detailed service telemetry. Unfortunately, operations teams are often not in the best position to evaluate the quality of the telemetry gathered from the instrumentation. This challenge is compounded by the fact that service delivery teams are asked to implement telemetry collection for the first time in live production systems. Exposing inadequately instrumented services to production users for the purposes of refining that instrumentation creates a period that puts customer satisfaction at risk. This burn-in period often becomes difficult to escape as new features are delivered from code bases without a strong linkage between software delivery and observability programs. Key performance indicators By having your development staff involved in improving your service instrumentation, you should realize observability benefits in the following ways. Better informed development decisions: By detecting areas of volatility or unexpected behavior and addressing them. By understanding what dependencies in your code lack redundancy or robustness, and taking measures to refactor the service. By appreciating how end-user cohorts are employing your software, you can better understand where improvements will have the biggest impact. Improved troubleshooting: More precise and contextually relevant telemetry from your service will allow for more accurate and actionable detection of faults. With better telemetry naming, operations staff can use a common language with developers during incidents, reducing the time to triage and remediate incidents. With these goals in mind, it is important to identify some simple KPIs that help to gauge the ongoing improvements in your software delivery and operations programs. The following outlines some suggested KPIs to consider as you invest in improved instrumentation. Business KPIs are aligned to your overall program objectives and should be consistently measured to demonstrate ongoing program improvement for each service. Practitioner KPIs are used to measure changes in the execution of job functions for those participating in the development and management of services. Business KPI Service quality A metric is required to define how well your service is operating. This will depend upon the needs of your organization and the constraints of the services being monitored. Goal: Improved service quality attainment score over time. Best practices: Create a graphical representation as a trend of Service Quality achievement for defined periods (Monthly / Quarterly). Service Apdex can provide an effective Service specific quality score. (See Apdex: Measure user satisfaction.) A well defined Service Level Management (SLM) approach using SLIs that describe the level of expected operation for service boundaries can be a useful way to establish a single measurement of quality. Release frequency The number of releases for a given service. This should indicate the velocity of the software delivery organization. Often release frequency isn’t immediately comparable between development organizations. Instead, weighting high-value releases or features to bugs can provide an improved comparative context. Goal: Consistency of attainment with consistent or improving Service Quality indicator. Best practices: Can be derived from deployment markers or other events sent to New Relic. Measure directly from code or project management tools such as Jira, BitBucket, GitHub. Consider implementing a collection mechanism to capture release events and store them directly in New Relic. See NR1 CICD Innovation for example JIRA and BitBucket configs. Practitioner KPI Feature release frequency Quantification of the percentage of releases that are directly related to new feature development versus bug fixes or technical debt retirement. The relationship to feature to fix will vary between teams and projects based on the history of the service. Goal: A consistent or improving feature release frequency consistent with the service delivery goals. Best practices: Practitioner feature release frequency is often acquired in the same manner as the broader release frequency business KPI. This metric is then made available to the development team for the service. Mean time to close Average duration of alert-driven incidents in New Relic. See Alert Quality Management Use Case Implementation Guide for more details. Goal: Steady decrease of incident close time for identified services. Best practices: Follow the Alert Quality Management Use Case Implementation Guide, understanding Service behavior through the lens of the alerts defined to help improve service delivery. Prerequisites Before you begin to introduce Service Instrumentation into your development processes, be sure to acquaint yourself with New Relic fundamentals available from New Relic University. In addition to NRU training, review and keep the following documentation resources handy: APM agent install and configuration Instrumentation guides: C-SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby OpenTelemetry SDKs Introduction to New Relic synthetic monitoring Establishing current state of your KPIs Determine your instrumentation needs Instrumentation is the process to acquire telemetry from a software system and its associated services for the purpose of describing that software system's runtime behavior and business function. Monitoring systems tend to provide generic capabilities for telemetry acquisition that can be fine tuned to close gaps when monitoring the function of a software system. This use case assumes that your Observability Program has completed the Quality Foundation OMA use case implementation guide and that you have a well considered and deployed telemetry collection architecture for your services. With the possible exception of alert definition, instrumentation offers the most open-ended and customizable activities related to observability. The New Relic One platform provides features to highly customize your use of instrumentation. Because of this, you should carefully consider the amount of time and effort you’re going to put into instrumenting your services. Like all Service Instrumentation assets and dependencies, the introduction of instrumentation will require ongoing oversight and maintenance and therefore is a form of technical debt you will accrue for your project. As you begin the process of instrumentation, you want to continually ask yourself the question: Is the visibility I will gain from this instrumentation worth the cost of implementation and support? Decision matrix As a first step you should evaluate the default instrumentation you obtain from your Observability platform and ask yourself the question: Does the telemetry adequately describe the function and the purpose of my service? For example, think about what your service does. Perhaps it receives an order, needs to validate the order for integrity, conveys that order to a clearinghouse service, and receives a confirmation code that is relayed back to the requestor. This example gives a clear path to break down the function of service and evaluate if we have enough telemetry and context to make informed appraisals of how the service is functioning. Conceptual service that receives and processes http requests. If this conceptual diagram represents the implementation of the service, you will want to know answers to the following questions, at any given moment in time: How many requests do I receive? How many messages and HTTP requests do I send? How many requests are successful? What is the response time for a full request? What is the response time for invocation to a dependency? How much resource should this process take under what number of requests? What are all my points of failure? Most monitoring frameworks for application runtimes will gather telemetry like this as basic functionality. However, sometimes specific implementation of your service will pose a challenge to the generic instrumentation assumptions made by the monitoring software. In this case your Observability platform will need to accommodate your needs and provide an ability to modify a default monitoring configuration. The following table documents some additional situations where you would consider adding additional telemetry or metadata capture through instrumentation. The practices section that follows describes how to close those gaps to ensure your observability platform provides telemetry needed to manage your service. Considerations for instrumentation: Are my base telemetry requirements satisfied? If not, document the gaps and evaluate if they can be closed through custom configuration or additional instrumentation techniques. Can I isolate discrete user stories within the telemetry? If not, use trace capabilities of agents to capture the invocation of a discrete user story with adequate context metadata. Do I have insight into the parameters that are invoking user stories? If not, use custom attributes through agent SDKs to add context to the transactions and spans. Can I measure the major functional components of the software? If not, use instrumentation SDKs to create baseline metrics on a specific functional element of the code. (cache lookups, processing routines, or utility functions). Can I measure the client interactions from my code to external systems? If not, ensure requests and responses are encapsulated by component level tracking. If the client invocation is asynchronous, consider implementing distributed trace features to view the successive processing. Understand endpoint testing Endpoint testing is a simple and practical approach that greatly expedites how to determine the root cause of a given system failure. It allows operations and supporting teams to quickly know there is a real problem, and isolate that problem to a specific service. Modern software systems depend on a number of services to complete their tasks. Historically, the process of monitoring those service endpoints was straightforward. The architecture team would produce a well documented map of dependencies for the operations team. The operations team would dutifully create a check of the itemized endpoints. Today, with continuous delivery processes and small batch changes, new endpoints and dependencies can be created and deployed at a rate that makes it difficult for an operations team to anticipate and proactively define synthetic checks. By giving the service developers greater scope of control to define production services tests during the development phase, you will greatly increase the coverage of endpoint tests for your Observability program. Decision matrix To determine whether to create a synthetic check is straightforward. Generally you will want to know the first occurrence of a failure for a dependency. If you answer “yes” to any of the following questions, consider creating a dedicated synthetic check. Is the end point customer facing? Does the endpoint invoke new dependencies? Is the endpoint on a different network infrastructure? Is the endpoint shared between multiple services? Is the endpoint a content origin supported by a CDN? Improvement process Config based instrumentation Each New Relic agent provides a variety of configuration options. Typically you will define a standard approach to include the agents within infrastructure hosts, application runtimes, and connections to your cloud service providers. Default agent configurations are generic and widely applicable. One of the best ways for developers to influence the applicability of deployment is by overriding the default configuration options for your service instance. The following are default instrumentation options to consider. Create an effective service name Tip New Relic agents provide a variety of mechanisms to define the Service runtime name. Please see the application naming guide to find the implementation details for your runtime environment. The name you give a service provides the namespace (where you will find the agent data). One of the most important strategies New Relic uses to understand the behavior of your services is to aggregate like things together and to use the commonalities derived from aggregation to isolate variance. Modern services are often deployed to multiple contexts to ensure capacity handling or specific functional segmentation. In order to take advantage of the benefits of aggregation, it is very important that your service runtimes are grouping instances with identical operational characteristics. Therefore, when deploying services, pay close attention to the following three criteria to help you name your deployed services: Does my service target a specific audience? Is my service running a different codebase? Is my codebase using a different runtime configuration? If you answer “yes” to any of these questions, consider creating a unique name for your service. Audience criteria Think of the audience as the group of end users or service functions. If your service is split between North American and European deployments, the runtimes in those deployments should be grouped accordingly. For example: newrelic.appname = PORTAL_AMER Copy and newrelic.appname = PORTAL_EMEA Copy This will group the telemetry created by that audience together, allowing you to better understand the contextual similarities of service problems related to a specific user audience. Sometimes the way we deploy applications divides the operational context of a service, such as a portal application with administrative functions. Maybe the admin functions are baked into the general portal codebase, but only one instance in a cluster is handling the portal admin requests. In that case you have a functional audience segmentation opportunity, so you should ensure that it is named appropriately. For example: newrelic.appname = PORTAL_MAIN Copy and newrelic.appname = PORTAL_ADMIN Copy Codebase criteria If you’re running different code versions under the guise of one service, consider segmenting those runtime instances and incorporating version naming as part of your naming scheme. When you group code together as one service name that is executing different service versions, you’re increasing the noise to signal ratio of any metrics you produce. Different code versions might use different amounts of compute resource or process data differently. It becomes very difficult to determine if a service is behaving normally when the signals you get from the metrics are due to different functional implementations. Consider adding a numeric identifier to the service name if you have multiple versions running concurrently. For example: newrelic.appname = PORTAL_MAIN_V112 Copy and newrelic.appname = PORTAL_MAIN_V115 Copy If you employ feature flag framework frameworks like LaunchDarkly or Split, you may have multiple versions of an application or service within a single codebase. Please consult the Isolating Service Functions section to address those conditions. Runtime criteria If an instance of a service is deployed to a system with different runtime constraints, it should be encapsulated in its own telemetry namespace. This can be a deployment to a different datacenter that offers network connectivity advantages to a shared resource, or perhaps the service is running on a separate compute tier with a different memory or thread configuration. These characteristics that affect the code runtime operation can cause different behaviors that lead to different operations behaviors. For example: newrelic.appname = PORTAL_NYC_DC Copy and newrelic.appname = PORTAL_REALLY_BIG_FOOTPRINT Copy Override default agent configuration Tip The New Relic agents provide a variety of options for runtime configuration. Please refer to the agent configuration guide for the options specific to your runtime. Each New Relic APM agent provides a variety of options to modify the default configuration. The most comprehensive and consistent location is the configuration file that accompanies each agent install. However, New Relic agents can also be configured by passing command line parameters directly to the service instance runtime, by using environment variables, or by calling functions within the agent's SDK at runtime. .NET agent configuration options: Using the New Relic .NET SDK API Environment variables Config file options Isolate service functions As the Create an effective service name section indicated, one of the primary objectives of instrumentation is to configure the New Relic agent to group like runtime constraints together as a single named unit. We suggest this because software systems should behave in deterministic ways. For a specific set of inputs, you should get an expected range of measurable outcomes. The degree to which we can comfortably contain these constraints into named service runtime components greatly helps us understand normal behavior and isolate aberrant behavior. Once you have settled on an effective service naming strategy, the next step is to look within the telemetry collected for the service and determine if it suitably isolates the service’s functionality. The implementation pattern we most often encounter is a series of functions being invoked by a web request. The initial receipt and handling of a web request to a service runtime results in the allocation of processing resources. New Relic defines this resource allocation and code execution as a transaction. The New Relic agent is configured with a set of assumptions that create namespaces for transactions as they are detected. Those assumptions differ between the agent language runtime. For example, a good example of how the New Relic Java agent determines the transaction name can be found in the Java agent's transaction naming documentation. However, even after the agent transaction naming protocol has been applied, it may leave you with an unsatisfactory result. By adding additional instrumentation to name the transaction to improve its context, this can greatly improve your understanding of the service’s execution behavior. The goal for transaction naming should be an APM transactions view that provides good segmentation of the services functions in an approach that is easy to understand for a non-developer. New Relic service transaction breakdown view. The transaction breakdown image is a good example of transaction segmentation. It provides detailed tracking of the amount of work being done by each transaction within the broader codebase of the service. It also displays the transaction with a plain user-friendly name that offers some hint of its business context (what the transaction does). As you learn more about naming transactions and including attributes, be sure to make your naming approach accessible for non-technical observers of the data. Transaction breakdown: the transactions in this service seem to be highly weighted to one transaction name with a pretty generic name. Breakdowns like this beg the question: \"Is this a good representation of the work my service does?\" The obtuse transaction breakdown image demonstrates a bad example of transaction name segmentation. In this case we have about 60% of the transaction volume being named OperationHandler/handle. Both the percentage attribution of the transaction volume and the generic nature of the name indicate there might be an overly zealous aggregation of transactions underneath that transaction namespace. A good way to validate your transaction naming approach is to review the distribution of response times for your transaction over a significant period of time in the service web transaction histogram dashboard. The service transaction histogram view shows the count of transactions that fall into each response time bucket. A good naming strategy tends to display a normal distribution. The service transaction image shows a wide range of transaction response rates. Although the bulk of the transactions land in the 0-200 millisecond range, it indicates values ranging from 200-1000 milliseconds. When you have a highly distributed range of responses for a transaction, you should ask yourself: What information do I have during the transaction execution that can help me name this transaction? In many cases, non-normal distributions are a direct result of the parameters being passed to a request, or the work the transaction is being asked to do. It is pretty easy to consider that a service query transaction might take a data range as a parameter. The date range when small might provide a faster lookup time. Therefore, perhaps providing a meaning scheme that is derived from some expected parameter constraints (> 1day, 1-5 days, >5 days) might provide a more meaningful segmentation. Your objective is to create a transaction name that facilitates grouping transactions with the fewest unique characteristics. A more normal distribution of transaction segmentation where individual transactions report more consistent response time attainment with fewer exceptions. The normal distribution image demonstrates more purposefully named transactions within a service. In this case the web transaction response times are more closely grouped, indicating consistent execution characteristics. By ensuring your transaction naming strategy provides a consistent mechanism to group your service’s functions by the types of operations they are performing, you will be able to quickly isolate aberrant behavior, or better understand the root cause of the variations. This will allow you to refactor your application and increase the overall predictability of your service’s functions. Define custom transaction names Tip Consult the New Relic agent API guide for your language agent to review the transaction naming procedure for your runtime. The New Relic agent transaction naming service requires the invocation of a SetName(String name) like API call to the New Relic agent SDK. Each language runtime agent has its own syntax and option for setting the name. For example, to take the value of an http request parameter and use it to name a transaction in the New Relic Java agent, you can use code similar to this: com.newrelic.agent.Agent.LOG.finer(\"[my query handler] Renaming transaction based on an important query parameter\"); com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic.setTransactionName(\"Query Handler_\" + (javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest)_servletrequest_0).getParameter(\"important_query_parm\")); Copy Please note: There is a maximum capacity to transaction names within New Relic. Your transaction naming strategy will have to trade off a degree of specificity if there are thousands of potential transaction names. When too many transaction names are being reported, New Relic will attempt to create rules to group those transaction names. More details can be found in the agent troubleshooting guide related to metric grouping issues. Should you suspect a metric grouping issue, open a support case with New Relic, and we will be happy to work with you to isolate the cause of the transaction naming issue. Capture parameters with your transactions Tip Consult the New Relic agent custom attributes guide for your agent language to review the metadata enhancement options for attribute customization. The transaction name is a powerful way for you to segment your Service’s functionality so that you can better understand its behavior. This allows you to discretely isolate functionality directly in the New Relic UI. However, there are many occasions when you will want to get some additional context on the function of your Service without resorting to isolating the transaction name. This can be accomplished by introducing attribute capture by your Service. You can add name:value pair attributes to decorate the details of each transaction. The attributes will be available in each transaction event through the APM transaction trace and errors UI, or through direct query of parameters from the NRDB transaction event type. After you select a transaction trace, you can view the custom attributes you have set for your Service’s transaction. Here is an example of the transaction trace details you can see in the APM errors UI. Custom attributes displayed in the APM errors UI. If you have developed a useful transaction name segmentation, you can use the additional context of the attributes to better understand the inputs, cohorts, or segments that led to an unexpected result. In addition to being able to understand the context of your transaction within the APM UI, the introduction of parameters is an extremely useful tool to aggregate and analyze transactions by querying transaction data directly. Custom attributes are added to each transaction, making it easy to isolate and facet on specific conditions. NRQL query expression that uses a custom attribute to facet database call duration. The parameter capture approach can also be used with feature flag systems like Split or LaunchDarkly. In this case, as you are implementing the decision handler for the feature flag, consider capturing the flag context (for example, optimized_version = on) that is being applied to the block of code controlling the version or feature the customer sees. NRQL query that demonstrates the result when the state of a feature flag is captured by a transaction custom attribute. The feature flag state attribute allows us to understand the impact of the code execution path on performance, throughput, and dependency utilization. For example, to take the value of an http request parameter and save it as a custom attribute in the New Relic Java agent, you can use code similar to this: com.newrelic.agent.Agent.LOG.finer(\"[my query handler] Adding an Attribute to transaction based on an important query parameter\"); com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"ImportantParm\", (javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest)_servletrequest_0).getParameter(\"important_query_parm\")); Copy Component measurement The behavior of a specific transaction within the context of a service is a powerful way to segregate functionality and ensure a software system is operating effectively. However, another way to look at the behavior of a software system is to review the detailed component execution model of its implementation. The application framework code components are shared throughout the service, and the ongoing evaluation of component performance can provide an insight into the overall service health. Within New Relic One there are two places we can observe component execution details. The service summary dashboard in APM provides a view of the composite execution of the service broken down by its component parts (for example, garbage collection execution or database calls). This summary dashboard provides a breakdown of major component types within the application. Memcached, External Web Invocations, MySQL and Dirac are all examples of shared code frameworks that the collective transactions of the Service are using to execute their business logic. A similar breakdown is provided on a transaction by transaction basis. This single transaction summary view breaks out the contributing execution time by component. This helps you see the aggregate performance of components within a transaction. Transaction component segments will tend to demonstrate consistent performance behavior, you can use this consistency to detect a change in its fundamental behavior. This can be a good indication of an underlying issue. Resource constraints tend to manifest more obviously within component frameworks than within individual transaction details. This allows you to infer characteristics of dependencies through the common constraints being experienced by all code running within a service. Ensure your frameworks are measured Tip Consult the New Relic agent instrumentation and SDK guides under the language agent for your service runtime to find information about adding metric names to your instrumentation. The syntax for framework instrustrumentation is specific to the language your service is written in, but the general approach is consistent for all. Consider the threads of execution within your Services as an analogy for transactions within New Relic telemetry. Each method or function execution on the stack is an opportunity to add additional instrumentation. In this way New Relic maintains a time-annotated invocation stack for the transaction and uses those method/function start/stop timings to aggregate it into a series of component metrics. A simple Node.js application making a call to a MongoDB. The two major components of the application are the receipt of the request and get/put operations to the MongoDB. If a particular segment of logic is crucial to the function of your Service or transaction, consider wrapping that call with callbacks to the New Relic agent so that the agent can understand that it has entered a discrete code component and can aggregate the time consumed within that component accordingly. By passing a metric name to the callback, you will create a component segment metric for your service and transaction. The metric naming option is specific to the instrumentation language, so be sure to consult the specific language documentation. The New Relic agents allow you to specify a custom metric name for the instrumentation. The metricName will be used to determine the aggregated metric for the component. The following example demonstrates the metricName parameter being passed to a Java agent SDK @Trace annotation. @Weave public abstract class MQOutboundMessageContext implements OutboundTransportMessageContext { @Trace(dispatcher = true, metricName=\"MQTransport\") public void send(final TransportSendListener listener) throws TransportException { try { NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().setMetricName(\"Message\", \"MQ\", \"Produce\"); MQHelper.processSendMessage(this, NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod()); } catch (Exception e) { NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger().log(Level.FINE, e, \"Unable to set metadata on outgoing MQ message\"); } Weaver.callOriginal(); } } Copy Track every external service call Tip Consult the New Relic agent instrumentation and SDK guides under the language agent for your service runtime to find the details of client library instrumentation. Client instrumentation refers to encapsulating a call from your service to an external resource. Generally, New Relic agents are aware of clients popular for HTTP, gRPC, messaging, and database protocols and will apply the appropriate instrumentation pattern to aggregate calls to those clients as external services. External service dashboard details within New Relic APM. If you have written your own client handler for a protocol, or are using something very new or somewhat niche, the New Relic agent may not recognize the client and record the behavior of the client call. To this end you should verify the external services and databases within APM to represent all expected externalities for your service. Database protocol dashboard details within New Relic APM. It is important to validate that all your services' dependencies are represented here. If you do not see your service dependencies, you will need to introduce new instrumentation to intercept the external call so that your APM agent can track it accordingly. The following example demonstrates wrapping an external call in Node.js for capture by the agent. package main import ( \"net/http\" \"github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic\" ) func currentTransaction() *newrelic.Transaction { return nil } func main() { txn := currentTransaction() client := &http.Client{} request, _ := http.NewRequest(\"GET\", \"http://www.example.com\", nil) segment := newrelic.StartExternalSegment(txn, request) response, _ := client.Do(request) segment.Response = response segment.End() } Copy Examples of other agent API external call tracing: Go ExternalSegment Java ExternalParameters Python external_trace Endpoint testing Endpoint testing provides two benefits to your Service Instrumentation program. Defect detection: By encoding a test for an endpoint that produces a simple true/false result, it allows the operations team to isolate discrete failures to determine if the integrity of service delivery has been compromised. Baselining: Synthetic or machine tests provide a predictable set of conditions that allow you to evaluate the consistency of your service delivery from a control perspective. New Relic’s synthetic monitoring offers the ability to create a variety of testing types by employing an enhanced Selenium JavaScript SDK. Once a Selenium-based test script has been defined, New Relic will manage the location of the script execution as well as its frequency. New Relic synthetics launch dashboard. The synthetic test offers a variety of test options, each with its own focus. For more information see our synthetic monitoring documentation. From the perspective of a Service developer, the monitor type that is most frequently employed is Endpoint availability. This monitor type provides the ability to script http request conditions. These can be as simple as a POST or GET to an accessible API, or involve multiple steps where the Selenium monitoring script successively evaluates requests to ascertain functional integrity of a multi-step process. In practice, developers should consider implementing the simplest possible test to evaluate endpoint availability and integrity. For example, you have just created a new Service endpoint that provides the current exchange rate for a group of currencies. This is a simple GET at an endpoint that returns a JSON object array. Request example: http://example-ip:3000/exchange Response example: [ { \"status\": [ \"quote\" ], \"_id\": \"5b9bf97f61c22f4fb5beb5c9\", \"name\": \"cdn\", \"Created_date\": \"2021-07-12T18:10:07.488Z\", \"__v\": 1 }, { \"status\": [ \"quote\" ], \"_id\": \"5b9bfb2a61c22f4fb5beb5ca\", \"name\": \"usd\", \"Created_date\": \"2021-07-12T18:17:14.224Z\", \"__v\": 0.80 }, { \"status\": [ \"quote\" ], \"_id\": \"5b9bfb3261c22f4fb5beb5cb\", \"name\": \"eur\", \"Created_date\": \"2021-07-12T18:17:22.476Z\", \"__v\": 0.68 }, { \"status\": [ \"quote\" ], \"_id\": \"5b9bfb3761c22f4fb5beb5cc\", \"name\": \"mex\", \"Created_date\": \"2021-07-12T18:17:27.009Z\", \"__v\": 15.97 } ] Copy In order for this service to be considered operational, it needs to respond to requests but also provide the four currency responses. We’re not worried about the content at the moment, just the fact we get four elements back in the array one, for each CDN, USD, EUR and MEX currencies. Using New Relic synthetic monitoring, an API test script could look like the following: /** * This script checks to see if we get the currency data from the endpoint. */ var assert = require('assert'); var myQueryKey = 'secret_key'; var options = { uri: 'http://example_ip:3000/exchange', headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; function callback (err, response, body){ var data = JSON.parse(body); var info = body; if (Array.isArray(data)) { if (data.length !== 4) { assert.fail('Unexpected results in API Call, result was ' + JSON.stringify(data)); } } } $http.get(options, callback); Copy The synthetics script can be directly configured in the New Relic interface, but we highly recommend you maintain your endpoint tests within your source repository system and employ automation. This will help ensure your endpoint testing accompanies the new endpoint dependencies that your Services introduce to production service delivery. Value realization The impact of Service Instrumentation will be directly related to the level of attention you’re willing to invest in overseeing the process. Like the process of monitoring services, your Observability program will benefit through a dedicated team function that thinks critically about its expectations of return for its investment in effort. Here is some guidance to think about the cost of investment for your organization and expectation of benefit. The following section outlines an approach for estimating the investments and returns you should expect by incorporating Service Instrumentation into your Observability practice. Investments Training Ensure all developers are familiar with New Relic agent SDKs and platform capabilities. Cost Model: Dependent on your company's developer FTE model and project estimation. Estimation: Typically a number of hours for a developer to become effective using New Relic instrumentation features. Initial: 16 HRS Training / Exploration Recurring: 4 HRS/Q Review Per developer a yearly investment of 16-40 hours training to develop core skills and maintain skills currency for New Relic platform Development and maintenance The development effort required to implement and maintain instrumentation within a Service project. Cost Model: Dependent on your company's developer FTE model and project estimation. Estimation: This tends to be dependent on the scope of the project and the amount of instrumentation work required. Initial: 8 HRS per developer per service Recurring: 4 HRS/Q Maintenance Per developer a project estimation of 16-32 hours developing and maintaining Service instrumentation Returns AQM impact Alert Quality Management delivers significant benefit to the operations team by ensuring the alert notifications from variant system performance are dealt with swiftly. This improves service delivery and resource allocation during incident remediation. An effective instrumentation practice federated into your observability program will greatly improve your team’s ability to create meaningful alerts. KPIs: Volume: Incident Count Volume: Accumulated Incident Duration Volume: Mean-Time-To-Close (MTTC) User Engagement: Mean Time to Investigate Outcomes: Less alert noise Greater alert and incident responsiveness Less unknown root cause Increased operations productivity Improved service delivery Service quality improvement Improving your service quality will have a direct impact on the key financial metrics for your Service. This will require that you have a well rationalized financial model for your application. Typically this return can be projected by associating a currency value for each percent improvement on a core service quality measure like errors or apdex attainment. As your investment in Service Instrumentation increases, you should see improved attainment on your service quality measures. KPIs: Service Quality (Business KPI) Outcomes: Decreased number of user impacting errors More performant and resilient Service components Service delivery improvement By providing better telemetry from your Service instances, your delivery organization should be able to more quickly detect volatility or downtime and remediate faster. This will lead to better overall service delivery KPIs and decrease episodes of outage or degradation. Cost can be associated with the amount of time it takes to detect, investigate and remediate an incident. This might be related to the value the Service provides your organization that will be lost during an event, or may be related to the general cost to deal with the poorly behaving Service. KPIs: Mean time to detect (MTTD) Mean time to identify (MTTI) Mean time to resolve (MTTR) Outcomes: Decreased time to detect incidents Decreased time to resolve incidents",

      "body": "Overview Digital customer experience is your end user’s experience across all your digital touch points. There are four core factors that impact a user’s experience: Availability (Is it reachable?) Performance (Does it perform well enough to be usable?) Content quality (Does it have what users need and can they find it?) Product and content relevance (Does it have what users care about?) Digital customer experience includes web, mobile, and IoT. The first version of this guide is focused on measuring the end user web experience. Quality Foundation is about creating a standard practice to help you understand your digital customer experience in a meaningful way. Desired Outcome This implementation guide will help you: Look at customer experience in relation to: Global functions, such as search and login Lines of business Regions Report back to business stakeholders on what they care about Prioritize what you work on Create a repeatable practice Key Performance Indicators Quality Foundation measures the following KPIs: JavaScript error rate KPI This KPI measures the number of JavaScript errors per page view. Goal: Remove irrelevant JavaScript errors being tracked either by tuning ingest or using filtering. Reduce JavaScript errors that impact customer performance. HTTP error rate KPI HTTP errors (or HTTP 4xx and 5xx responses) happen when calls to the backend are not successful. Goal: Measure and reduce the HTTP error rate to ensure your customers are able to do what they came to your site to do. Time to first byte KPI This KPI measures the time from navigation start (a user clicking a link) to the browser receiving the first byte of the response from the server. Goal: Reduce the time to first byte by improving CDN, network, and service performance. Core web vitals: Largest contentful paint (LCP) KPI Core Web Vitals are part of Google’s Page Experience Metrics. They measure the experience from when a page begins rendering. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) measures the time it takes to load the largest image after a user has navigated to a new page. Goal: Reduce LCP to 2.5 seconds or better for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Reduce FID to 100 milliseconds or better for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Core web vitals: First input delay (FID) KPI This KPI measures the experience from when a page begins rendering. Goal: Reduce FID to 100 milliseconds or better for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Cumulative layout shift (CLS) KPI This KPI measures how much the page layout shifts during render. Goal: Maintain a score of 0.1 or less for the 75% percentile for all pages or at least the most critical pages. Prerequisites Required knowledge Familiarity with synthetic monitoring Familiarity with browser monitoring Familiarity with basic Browser UI views Familiarity with SPA data in Browser UI Required Installation and Configuration Browser Pro installed in all pages SPA enabled for single page applications Synthetics monitors configured: Ping monitors configured for anonymous users Scripted synthetics check configured for login flow Monitors should be configured to test from all regions applicable to your users Monitors should be configured for each domain and each login flow Data retention for browser events is at least 2x an average sprint. Establish current state Review Instrumented Pages Review Browser apps and pages to make sure that everything you expect to report back to New Relic is. You can do this by reviewing the Page Views tab in the Browser UI or running the following query: SELECT uniques(pageUrl) from PageView LIMIT MAX Copy You may need to filter out URLs that contain request or customer ID. Validate Browser URL Grouping Ensure Browser segments are captured correctly so user experience performance is measurable in both the NewRelic UI as well as at the aggregate level when querying via NRQL. A segment is the text between two / in a URL or between . of a domain name. For example, in the URL website.com/product/widget-name, the segments are: website .com product widget-name When there are a lot of URLs with a lot of segments, URLs can get crushed, so that website.com/product/widget-name becomes website.com/ or website.com/product/. In this example, the first crushed URL is not particularly useful, but the second one may be a useful way of aggregating customer experience data for the product. Not sure whether you need to tune your configuration? Import the Segment Allow List Investigation dashboard in GitHub to help. Once you’ve identified which segments to add, you can add them using Segment allow lists in Browser. Understand How You Will Segment Your Data Make Customer Experience data understandable and actionable by breaking it out into different segments. In this case, segments refer to groups of data. It does not refer to sections of URLs, as in segment allow lists. Consider the following statements: Most of our users experience 3 seconds or better to first input delay. On average, we see 2 seconds to the largest contentful paint. Last week, there were 1 million page views. Compared to: Most of the users in the US, Canada, and EMEA experience 2 seconds or better to first input delay. Malaysia and Indonesia users experience 4 seconds; we are looking into this. Customers buying car insurance typically see 1 second to largest contentful paint. For home insurance, it’s 4 seconds. Last week, there were 700,000 page views on mobile browser apps compared to 300,000 on desktop. Let’s make sure we’re optimizing our mobile experience. Typical segmentation involves breaking down user experience into the following categories: Segment Guidance Region/Location Basic: Group by country. Browser events automatically contain the country code of requests, so there is nothing you need to do to break it out further. Advanced: Make regional grouping match regional SLO groups by creating your own region attribute using custom attributes in Browser. Facet by countryCode. Related attributes: regionCode city asnLatitude asnLongitude Device Break out performance and engagement device type so you can understand: Typical breakdown of desktop vs mobile browser users Experience of desktop vs mobile browser users Facet by deviceType. Related attributes: userAgentName userAgentOS userAgentVersion Product/Line of Business In this scenario, a product is a separate line of business or service provided by your organization. Some examples of industries and respective products: An insurance company that sells both car and house insurance A media company that has multiple streaming services or channels A travel company that provides car rental as well as hotel bookings Basic: Break out performance by product by: Faceting on pageUrl: Use this approach when multiple products are grouped into one browser app in New Relic. Faceting by appName: Use this approach when each product is instrumented as a separate web app. Grouping by appName and then facet: Use this approach when there are multiple apps in browser supporting one product. Advanced: Add product offering as a custom attribute to browser pages using custom attributes. Environment During instrumentation or afterwards, follow a naming convention that specifies the environment in Browser. Well named browser apps specify product and/or function as well as environment. Examples: account-management.prod hotels-book.prod car-insurance.uat Using app naming conventions to specify the environment supports filtering data in both the UI and in dashboards. For more information, see the documentation for how to rename Browser apps. Team In some organizations, a single team supports multiple products, while in others, a product is big enough to be supported by multiple teams. Report on team performance against customer experience or engagement by either adding the team name to the Browser app name (for example, account-management.prod.unicorn-squad) or by using custom attributes. Import the Quality Foundation Dashboard This step creates the dashboard that you will use to measure your customer experience and improve it. Clone the GitHub repository. Follow the GitHub repository README instructions to implement the dashboard. Make sure to align the dashboard to lines of business or customer facing offerings rather than teams. This ensures optimization time is spent where it is most impactful. Capture Current Performance For Each Dashboard Page Follow the GitHub README instructions. Use the dashboard from the previous step to understand the overall performance for each line of business. If relevant, apply filters to see performance across region or device. If values drop below targets and it matters, add it to the sheet as a candidate for improvement. Not worth tracking: A company that sells insurance in the US only notices poor performance in Malaysia. Worth tracking: A company that sells insurance in the US only notices poor performance with respect to mobile users in the US. Improvement Process Plan your work Whether you have a dedicated initiative to improve performance or classifying as ongoing maintenance, you need to track your progress at the end of every sprint. Decide which KPIs to Improve You now know what your user experience looks like across multiple lines of business. Where should you be improving? Start with business priorities. If you have clear business directives or have access to a senior manager above who does, you should focus on what matters most to your organization. For example, let’s say your company has recently launched a new initiative around a line of business but the KPIs associated with the UI are below target. This is where you should focus time initially. Next, focus on KPIs for each line of business. Finally, filter each line of business by device, region, etc., to see if additional focus is needed for specific regions or devices. Improve Targeted KPIs To track your progress, create a new dashboard or add a new page to the existing dashboard and name it Quality Foundation KPI Improvement. For more information, see Improve Web Uptime. Improve Page Load Performance Narrow your focus to specific pages that aren’t meeting target KPI values. For each page load KPI result that is out of bounds in the Quality Foundation Dashboard, remove the COMPARE WITH clause and add FACET pageUrl/targetGroupedUrl LIMIT MAX to find which pages are the poor performers. Use targetGroupedUrl when there are many results; for example, when the customer ID is part of the URL. Otherwise, use pageUrl. Original Dashboard query: FROM PageViewTiming SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) WHERE appName ='WebPortal' AND pageUrl LIKE '%phone%' SINCE 1 week AGO COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO Copy New query to identify problem pages: FROM PageViewTiming SELECT percentile(largestContentfulPaint, 75) WHERE appName ='WebPortal' AND pageUrl LIKE '%phone%' FACET targetGroupedUrl LIMIT MAX Copy Once you have identified which pages to improve, improve them following these best practices. Improve AJAX Response Times Find the slow requests. Go to the Ajax duration widget on the dashboard. View query, then open in query builder. Add facet requestUrl LIMIT MAX to the end of the query. Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - AjaxResponseTimes. Focus improving requests with a timeToSettle > 2.5s. Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to improve response times. See AJAX troubleshooting tips. Improve the AJAX Error Rate Find the failing requests. Go to Dashboards > Query builder. Enter FROM AjaxRequest SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode >= 400) WHERE httpResponseCode >= 200 AND <Ajax Request filter> SINCE 1 week AGO facet pageUrl, appName Copy Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - Pages with AjaxErrors. Run the query again for the most problematic pages to find the requests that are failing: FROM AjaxRequest SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode >= 400) WHERE httpResponseCode >= 200 AND pageUrl=<problematic page> AND appName = <corresponding app> <Ajax Request filter> SINCE 1 week AGO facet requestUrl Copy Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to improve response times. See AJAX troubleshooting tips. Improve Javascript Errors Find the most common failures. Go to Dashboards > Query builder Enter FROM JavaScriptError SELECT count(errorClass) SINCE 1 week AGO WHERE <PageView filter> FACET transactionName, errorClass, errorMessage, domain Copy Run the query. View the results as a table and save to your KPI Improvement dashboard as LOB - Javascript Errors. Use this information to figure out which errors need to be addressed Use New Relic’s recommended best practices to resolve errors that need addressing. See JavaScript errors page: Detect and analyze errors. Remove third party errors that do not add value. You may be using a third party JavaScript that is noisy but works as expected. You can take a couple of approaches: Remove the domain name from the JavaScript error/Pageview ratio widget and add it as its own widget so you can see unexpected changes. You can alert on this using Baseline NRQL alerts. Drop the JavaScript error using drop filters. Only use this option if the volume of errors is impacting your data ingest in a significant way. Be as specific as you can in the drop filter. Conclusion Best practices going forward: Revisit performance metrics (shared in this document as Quality Foundation KPIs) at the end of each sprint. Incorporate performance improvements into developer sprints. Openly share metrics with the lines of the business you support as well as other internal stakeholders. Define Customer Experience SLOs. Create alerts for business critical drops in Quality Foundation KPIs. Value Realization: At the end of this process you should now: Have an understanding of your end user experience in a way that is tangible, actionable, and easy for engineers as well as the business to understand. Know how releases impact your end customers. Know how your customers are impacted by service, infrastructure, or network level events. See latency issues caused by backend services if they exist. Have created, or be on the path to create, a common language with business owners so you are working together. This can open new avenues for recognition and sponsorship for new projects.",

      "body": "Overview Teams suffer from alert fatigue when they experience high alert volumes and alerts that are not aligned to business impact. As they start to believe that most alerts are false, they may prioritize easy to resolve alerts over others.  Also, they may close unresolved incidents so they can stay within their SLA targets. The result will be slower incident responses, magnified issue scope, and increased severity when true business impacting issues occur. Alert Quality Management (AQM) focuses on reducing the number of nuisance incidents so that you focus only on alerts with true business impact.  This reduces alert fatigue and ensures that you and your team focus your attention on the right places at the right times. You are a good candidate for AQM if: You have too many alerts. You have alerts that stay open for long time periods. Your alerts are not relevant. Your customers discover your issues before your monitoring tools do. You can't see the value of your observability tool(s). Desired outcome An alert strategy based on measuring business impact will result in faster response times and greater proactive awareness of critical events.  An improved alert signal to noise ratio reduces confusion and improves rapid identification and problem isolation. AQM's overall goal is to ensure that fewer, more valuable, incidents are created, resulting in: Increased uptime and availability Reduced MTTR Decreased alert volume The ability to easily identify alerts that are not valuable, so you can either make them valuable or remove them. The AQM process described in this guide generates the key performance indicators and metrics that you will use to measure progress towards these goals.  The metrics are measured in real time, published in a dashboard, and are used to drive a continuous improvement process that identifies and reduces nuisance alerts and increases user engagement in incident investigation. AQM does not encompass anomaly detection or AIOps, which are designed to detect unknown or unexpected modes of failure.  The two practices (AQM and ML/AI) work hand in hand, they are not mutually exclusive. Key performance indicators You will use the AQM process to collect and measure the following KPIs: Incident volume Incident Count Accumulated incident time Mean Time to Close (MTTC) Percent Under 5 Minutes User Engagement Mean Time to Investigate  (MTTI) % of Incidents Investigated These KPIs will help you to find the noisiest and least valuable alerts so you can improve their value or eliminate them.  You will then use the long term metric trends to show real business impact to management and stakeholders.  Detailed information on each metric follows. Incident volume You should treat incidents (with or without alerts) like a queue of tasks.  Just like a queue, the number of alerts should spend time near zero. Each incident should be a trigger for action to resolve the condition.  If an alert does not result in action, then you should question the value of the alert condition. If you see a constant rate of incidents or specific incidents that are \"always-on\", then you should question why. Are you in a constant state of business impact, or do you simply have a large volume of noise? The alert volume KPIs help you to answer those questions and to measure progress towards a healthy state of high quality alerting. Incident count KPI Incident Count is the number of incidents generated over a period of time. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. Goal: Reduce the number of low value / nuisance incidents. Best practices: Ensure condition settings are intended to detect real business impact. Ensure condition settings are detecting abnormal behavior. Communicate that the incident details \"Acknowledge\" feature helps measure meaningful and actionable alerts. See Percentage Incident Acknowledge KPI. Report AQM KPIs to all stakeholders. Accumulated incident duration KPI Accumulated incident duration is the total sum of minutes that all the incidents accumulated over a period of time. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. Goal: Reduce the total accumulated minutes of incidents. Best practices: Do not manually close incidents. Manual closure will skew the real duration of incident length. Eliminate alerts that do not result in any remediation actions from the recipients. Improve percent investigated and mean-time-to-investigate KPIs by communicating their importance in improving detection and response times. Report AQM KPIs to all Stakeholders. Mean time to close (MTTC) KPI Average duration of incidents within the period of time measured. Goal: Reduce MTTC Best practices: Do not manually close incidents. Manual closure will skew the real duration of incident length. Improve Reliability Engineering skills. Report AQM KPIs to all stakeholders. Percent under 5 minutes KPI Percentage of incidents where the duration of the incident is under five minutes. This can be an indicator of incident flapping. Goal: Minimize percentage of incidents with short durations Best practices: Ensure that conditions are detecting legitimate deviations from expected behavior. See Baselining and Service Level Management. Ensure that conditions are detecting legitimate deviations that correlate to business impact or impending business impact. User engagement You should measure the value of an incident by the amount of attention it receives.  Engagement in this context is measured by whether or not an incident has been acknowledged. The amount of engagement an individual alert receives is a direct measurement of its value.  More engagement implies a valuable alert, less (or zero) engagement implies a nuisance alert that should be modified or disabled. There is a significant difference between measuring the moment of incident awareness vs. acknowledging the moment resolution activity begins. If you are using an integration with New Relic Alerting, be sure that the \"acknowledge\" event that is sent to New Relic is triggered when resolution activity begins, not when the incident is sent to the external incident management tool.  For more information regarding the standard Incident Management process, see \"Incident Management Process: 5 Steps to Effective Resolution Posted on August 31, 2020 by OnPage Corporation. -- in reference to ITIL4\" Percentage Acknowledged KPI Incidents acknowledged identifies the percentage of incidents that have been engaged with and had their acknowledged property set to true. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. Goal: Increase the percentage of incident engagement. Best practices: Educate the DevOps team on when it is appropriate to acknowledge an incident alert. Gamify alert acknowledgement to drive usage. Discourage mass acknowledgement exercises. Mean time to investigate (MTTI) KPI Mean time to investigate identifies the average time it takes for an incident to be triaged. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. Goal: Reduce the mean time to investigate Best practices: Work at building incident responder's confidence in alerts. Ensure that valuable alerts are acknowledged. Incentivize response teams to respond quickly to alerts. Prerequisites Before you begin, if you don't have equivalent experience, complete the New Relic University (NRU) Overview Course. Also, make sure you have a basic understanding of: NR1 Alert policy and conditions configuration NR1 incident notification channel webhook configuration NR1 NRQL NR1 alerting best practices NR1 APM & Infrastructure How to baseline data in order to determine anomalies vs. normal behavior. Establish current state of your KPIs As with any continuous improvement process, the first step of AQM is to establish the current state of your KPIs. To do so, perform the following tasks: Install and configure the incident event webhook Install the AQM Dashboard Perform initial AQM orientation and enablement Accumulate AQM data Perform second enablement session Install and configure the incident event webhook The webhook will create New Relic events for each incident as it proceeds through its lifecycle (open, acknowledge, close). To ensure that the AQM process generates accurate and valuable findings, this webhook must be added as a notification channel to every alert policy. The AQM process requires incident, not violation data. This is why you will not be using the default NrAiIncident event, which provides violation data only.  Instead, you will use this webhook to send the required incident data to New Relic. To use the webhook, do the following: Identify your primary production account and each of your accounts that you will be analyzing with the AQM process. Install the incident event webhook into each account that will participate in the AQM process and configure the webhook to report nrAQMIncident events to your primary production account. Assign the webhook as a notification channel to every alert policy in each account. This example shows a webhook notification channel assigned to each alert policy for a New Relic account with multiple sub-accounts. The webhook, AQM dashboard, and detailed installation instructions can be found in the New Relic OMA resource center on GitHub. Install the AQM dashboard The AQM dashboard is the primary asset that drives the AQM process.  You need to install the AQM dashboard into the primary production account you identified in the \"Install and configure incident event webhook\" step you previously performed by doing the following: Download the dashboard definition JSON file from the New Relic OMA resource center GitHub repo. Import the definition into your primary production account. For more details on importing dashboards, see the New Relic Introduction to dashboards documentation Perform initial AQM orientation and enablement During this phase, your incident management team(s) and other stakeholders will learn the goals of the AQM process and the scope of their involvement in it. The most critical portion of this task is educating your team on the importance of acknowledging incident alerts, since that's how the alert's value is determined.  In general, instruct them to follow these guidelines: If you look at an alert and decide to take any sort of further investigative action, acknowledge the alert. If you typically close an alert without doing anything else, do not acknowledge the alert. If the incident alert is always on, do not close or acknowledge it. For further details, see Second Enablement Session. You can use the first session template presentation to communicate this material to your stakeholders. Accumulate AQM data The overall process requires at least two weeks of data before it can proceed.  During this time, you should periodically check the following items: Confirm that incident alert event data is accumulating. Confirm that the webhook is attached to every alert policy. Ensure that incident responders are following the alert acknowledgement guidelines. Perform second enablement session During this phase, you will introduce incident management teams and other stakeholders to the initial AQM data and the ongoing continuous  improvement process you'll be following. The process consists of four activities: Review AQM Dashboard and KPI Trending - Here you and the stakeholders will look at the AQM KPIs and identify their week over week trends.  The team should identify areas where KPIs are not improving and develop strategies to drive improvement. Identify Achievements, Challenges, and Opportunities - Here you and the stakeholders will map the current state of alert quality to business impact, identifying areas where improvement has resulted in better business outcomes and areas where problems are impacting business outcomes. Incident Policy Review - Using the AQM dashboard, you and the stakeholders will identify the noisiest incident policies.  Once identified, those policies should be evaluated as detailed in step 4 below. Alert Policy Recommendations - In this step, you and the stakeholders will review the noisiest policies using the following criteria: Do the alerts have any business impact? Are the policies properly configured? Are they telling us something about the resource that needs to be fixed? Are the policies necessary? (i.e. do they have business impact) Are the thresholds set properly? Technical recommendations - Here, you and the stakeholders will review any technical recommendations, including: Are there application / system problems for engineering to review? Are there poorly constructed policies that need to be fixed? Are there instrumentation gaps? You can use the second session template presentation to keep this part of the AQM process organized. Improvement process This is the ongoing phase of the continuous improvement process where you periodically review your accumulated AQM data and make adjustments as needed to alert policies. You should perform this step once a week until your alert volume is acceptable. You can then perform it less frequently. During this phase you should: Report your KPIs each week to upper management to ensure that the stakeholder teams are appropriately prioritizing the work and to show that progress towards the promised business outcomes are being reached. Record and retain your weekly KPIs  over periods of months to years to establish a baseline and to show the rate of improvement. You should keep in mind that this is a continuous improvment process, you will continue to collect and evaluate the KPIs over long periods of time to ensure you are meeting your AQM goals. Value realization Once the AQM process is established, you will see significant reductions in the volume of alerts while reliability and stability remain the same or improve.  In addition, you should see that your alerts have a clear and unambiguous business impact.  Your AQM KPIs will provide quantifiable proof of these improvements. Once you are firmly on the path to AQM's goals, consider moving to other use cases within the Uptime, Performance, and Reliability value stream, such as Service Level Management, or Reliability Engineering.  You can also move to other observability maturity value streams, such as Customer Experience. KPI reference Following are the descriptions of each KPI as well as sample NRQL queries that will extract them from the New Relic platform.  These KPIs are also included in the AQM dashboard that can be downloaded from the New Relic OMA resource center GitHub repo. Incident volume Incident count KPI Incident Count is the number of incidents generated over a period of time. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks. NRQL: FROM nrAQMIncident SELECT count(*) AS 'Incident Count' WHERE current_state='open' AND severity='CRITICAL' SINCE 1 WEEK AGO COMPARE WITH 1 WEEK AGO Accumulated incident duration KPI Accumulated incident duration is the total sum of minutes that all the incidents accumulated over a period of time. Typically you should compare the current and previous weeks.

This can be an indicator of incident flapping.

      "body": "Overview \"Do I have all the telemetry I need to adequately measure my service?\" The process of onboarding a service for production monitoring tends to start from the end and work its way to the beginning. Typically a completed service is instantiated with agent based monitoring and the team responsible for service delivery needs to read the telemetry coming out of the agent like tea leaves, working their way backward to understand how the service functions by what can be observed. At New Relic, through tens of thousands of observability deployments, we have discovered that the more involved designers, architects, and developers can be in the definition of optimal service delivery measurement, the better. The emergence of the IT aphorism shift left speaks to the need to involve developers more directly in the software lifecycle activities that happen after the development stage is complete. In the case of service observability, we find there is little specific guidance on how developers can meaningfully contribute to production telemetry definitions. This guide is intended to provide practical suggestions for service developers to evaluate the state of your telemetry and suggest paths to improve it. Observability programs that closely link developer expectations with the runtime behavior of production systems are much more effective to diagnose and remediate aberrant conditions. The closer developer connection also produces services that are more robust and performant. You’re a good candidate for service characterization if any of the following are true: Your development teams are disconnected from production observability design. Your production monitoring program suffers from a lag between the introduction of new services/capabilities and their coverage with telemetry and alerting. You need to provide additional business context to your instrumentation for diagnosis and business KPI measurement. You employ a highly customized or proprietary software framework. Your service is under active development. Legacy services, and services built from commercial-off-the-shelf platforms tend to be better served with generic instrumentation options. Desired outcome This guide focuses on the metrics derived from your service’s runtime operation (its code execution) as well as external measurements of execution (through synthetic testing). Service instrumentation planning is the approach used to describe a single service runtime through telemetry. Modern monitoring systems provide deep insight into the technical details of service implementation. The power of distributed trace or bytecode instrumentation allows operations teams to quickly collect detailed service telemetry. Unfortunately, operations teams are often not in the best position to evaluate the quality of the telemetry gathered from the instrumentation. This challenge is compounded by the fact that service delivery teams are asked to implement telemetry collection for the first time in live production systems. Exposing inadequately instrumented services to production users for the purposes of refining that instrumentation creates a period that puts customer satisfaction at risk. This burn-in period often becomes difficult to escape as new features are delivered from code bases without a strong linkage between software delivery and observability programs. Key performance indicators By having your development staff involved in improving your service instrumentation, you should realize observability benefits in the following ways. Better informed development decisions: By detecting areas of volatility or unexpected behavior and addressing them. By understanding what dependencies in your code lack redundancy or robustness, and taking measures to refactor the service. By appreciating how end-user cohorts are employing your software, you can better understand where improvements will have the biggest impact. Improved troubleshooting: More precise and contextually relevant telemetry from your service will allow for more accurate and actionable detection of faults. With better telemetry naming, operations staff can use a common language with developers during incidents, reducing the time to triage and remediate incidents. With these goals in mind, it is important to identify some simple KPIs that help to gauge the ongoing improvements in your software delivery and operations programs. The following outlines some suggested KPIs to consider as you invest in improved instrumentation. Business KPIs are aligned to your overall program objectives and should be consistently measured to demonstrate ongoing program improvement for each service. Practitioner KPIs are used to measure changes in the execution of job functions for those participating in the development and management of services. Business KPI Service quality A metric is required to define how well your service is operating. This will depend upon the needs of your organization and the constraints of the services being monitored. Goal: Improved service quality attainment score over time. Best practices: Create a graphical representation as a trend of Service Quality achievement for defined periods (Monthly / Quarterly). Service Apdex can provide an effective Service specific quality score. (See Apdex: Measure user satisfaction.) A well defined Service Level Management (SLM) approach using SLIs that describe the level of expected operation for service boundaries can be a useful way to establish a single measurement of quality. Release frequency The number of releases for a given service. This should indicate the velocity of the software delivery organization. Often release frequency isn’t immediately comparable between development organizations. Instead, weighting high-value releases or features to bugs can provide an improved comparative context. Goal: Consistency of attainment with consistent or improving Service Quality indicator. Best practices: Can be derived from deployment markers or other events sent to New Relic. Measure directly from code or project management tools such as Jira, BitBucket, GitHub. Consider implementing a collection mechanism to capture release events and store them directly in New Relic. See NR1 CICD Innovation for example JIRA and BitBucket configs. Practitioner KPI Feature release frequency Quantification of the percentage of releases that are directly related to new feature development versus bug fixes or technical debt retirement. The relationship to feature to fix will vary between teams and projects based on the history of the service. Goal: A consistent or improving feature release frequency consistent with the service delivery goals. Best practices: Practitioner feature release frequency is often acquired in the same manner as the broader release frequency business KPI. This metric is then made available to the development team for the service. Mean time to close Average duration of alert-driven incidents in New Relic. See Alert Quality Management Use Case Implementation Guide for more details. Goal: Steady decrease of incident close time for identified services. Best practices: Follow the Alert Quality Management Use Case Implementation Guide, understanding Service behavior through the lens of the alerts defined to help improve service delivery. Prerequisites Before you begin to introduce Service Instrumentation into your development processes, be sure to acquaint yourself with New Relic fundamentals available from New Relic University. In addition to NRU training, review and keep the following documentation resources handy: APM agent install and configuration Instrumentation guides: C-SDK Go Java .NET Node.js PHP Python Ruby OpenTelemetry SDKs Introduction to New Relic synthetic monitoring Establishing current state of your KPIs Determine your instrumentation needs Instrumentation is the process to acquire telemetry from a software system and its associated services for the purpose of describing that software system's runtime behavior and business function. Monitoring systems tend to provide generic capabilities for telemetry acquisition that can be fine tuned to close gaps when monitoring the function of a software system. This use case assumes that your Observability Program has completed the Quality Foundation OMA use case implementation guide and that you have a well considered and deployed telemetry collection architecture for your services. With the possible exception of alert definition, instrumentation offers the most open-ended and customizable activities related to observability. The New Relic One platform provides features to highly customize your use of instrumentation. Because of this, you should carefully consider the amount of time and effort you’re going to put into instrumenting your services. Like all Service Instrumentation assets and dependencies, the introduction of instrumentation will require ongoing oversight and maintenance and therefore is a form of technical debt you will accrue for your project. As you begin the process of instrumentation, you want to continually ask yourself the question: Is the visibility I will gain from this instrumentation worth the cost of implementation and support? Decision matrix As a first step you should evaluate the default instrumentation you obtain from your Observability platform and ask yourself the question: Does the telemetry adequately describe the function and the purpose of my service? For example, think about what your service does. Perhaps it receives an order, needs to validate the order for integrity, conveys that order to a clearinghouse service, and receives a confirmation code that is relayed back to the requestor. This example gives a clear path to break down the function of service and evaluate if we have enough telemetry and context to make informed appraisals of how the service is functioning. Conceptual service that receives and processes http requests. If this conceptual diagram represents the implementation of the service, you will want to know answers to the following questions, at any given moment in time: How many requests do I receive? How many messages and HTTP requests do I send? How many requests are successful? What is the response time for a full request? What is the response time for invocation to a dependency? How much resource should this process take under what number of requests? What are all my points of failure? Most monitoring frameworks for application runtimes will gather telemetry like this as basic functionality. However, sometimes specific implementation of your service will pose a challenge to the generic instrumentation assumptions made by the monitoring software. In this case your Observability platform will need to accommodate your needs and provide an ability to modify a default monitoring configuration. The following table documents some additional situations where you would consider adding additional telemetry or metadata capture through instrumentation. The practices section that follows describes how to close those gaps to ensure your observability platform provides telemetry needed to manage your service. Considerations for instrumentation: Are my base telemetry requirements satisfied? If not, document the gaps and evaluate if they can be closed through custom configuration or additional instrumentation techniques. Can I isolate discrete user stories within the telemetry? If not, use trace capabilities of agents to capture the invocation of a discrete user story with adequate context metadata. Do I have insight into the parameters that are invoking user stories? If not, use custom attributes through agent SDKs to add context to the transactions and spans. Can I measure the major functional components of the software? If not, use instrumentation SDKs to create baseline metrics on a specific functional element of the code. (cache lookups, processing routines, or utility functions). Can I measure the client interactions from my code to external systems? If not, ensure requests and responses are encapsulated by component level tracking. If the client invocation is asynchronous, consider implementing distributed trace features to view the successive processing. Understand endpoint testing Endpoint testing is a simple and practical approach that greatly expedites how to determine the root cause of a given system failure. It allows operations and supporting teams to quickly know there is a real problem, and isolate that problem to a specific service. Modern software systems depend on a number of services to complete their tasks. Historically, the process of monitoring those service endpoints was straightforward. The architecture team would produce a well documented map of dependencies for the operations team. The operations team would dutifully create a check of the itemized endpoints. Today, with continuous delivery processes and small batch changes, new endpoints and dependencies can be created and deployed at a rate that makes it difficult for an operations team to anticipate and proactively define synthetic checks. By giving the service developers greater scope of control to define production services tests during the development phase, you will greatly increase the coverage of endpoint tests for your Observability program. Decision matrix To determine whether to create a synthetic check is straightforward. Generally you will want to know the first occurrence of a failure for a dependency. If you answer “yes” to any of the following questions, consider creating a dedicated synthetic check. Is the end point customer facing? Does the endpoint invoke new dependencies? Is the endpoint on a different network infrastructure? Is the endpoint shared between multiple services? Is the endpoint a content origin supported by a CDN? Improvement process Config based instrumentation Each New Relic agent provides a variety of configuration options. Typically you will define a standard approach to include the agents within infrastructure hosts, application runtimes, and connections to your cloud service providers. Default agent configurations are generic and widely applicable. One of the best ways for developers to influence the applicability of deployment is by overriding the default configuration options for your service instance. The following are default instrumentation options to consider. Create an effective service name Tip New Relic agents provide a variety of mechanisms to define the Service runtime name. Please see the application naming guide to find the implementation details for your runtime environment. The name you give a service provides the namespace (where you will find the agent data). One of the most important strategies New Relic uses to understand the behavior of your services is to aggregate like things together and to use the commonalities derived from aggregation to isolate variance. Modern services are often deployed to multiple contexts to ensure capacity handling or specific functional segmentation. In order to take advantage of the benefits of aggregation, it is very important that your service runtimes are grouping instances with identical operational characteristics. Therefore, when deploying services, pay close attention to the following three criteria to help you name your deployed services: Does my service target a specific audience? Is my service running a different codebase? Is my codebase using a different runtime configuration? If you answer “yes” to any of these questions, consider creating a unique name for your service. Audience criteria Think of the audience as the group of end users or service functions. If your service is split between North American and European deployments, the runtimes in those deployments should be grouped accordingly. For example: newrelic.appname = PORTAL_AMER Copy and newrelic.appname = PORTAL_EMEA Copy This will group the telemetry created by that audience together, allowing you to better understand the contextual similarities of service problems related to a specific user audience. Sometimes the way we deploy applications divides the operational context of a service, such as a portal application with administrative functions. Maybe the admin functions are baked into the general portal codebase, but only one instance in a cluster is handling the portal admin requests. In that case you have a functional audience segmentation opportunity, so you should ensure that it is named appropriately. For example: newrelic.appname = PORTAL_MAIN Copy and newrelic.appname = PORTAL_ADMIN Copy Codebase criteria If you’re running different code versions under the guise of one service, consider segmenting those runtime instances and incorporating version naming as part of your naming scheme. When you group code together as one service name that is executing different service versions, you’re increasing the noise to signal ratio of any metrics you produce. Different code versions might use different amounts of compute resource or process data differently. It becomes very difficult to determine if a service is behaving normally when the signals you get from the metrics are due to different functional implementations. Consider adding a numeric identifier to the service name if you have multiple versions running concurrently. For example: newrelic.appname = PORTAL_MAIN_V112 Copy and newrelic.appname = PORTAL_MAIN_V115 Copy If you employ feature flag framework frameworks like LaunchDarkly or Split, you may have multiple versions of an application or service within a single codebase. Please consult the Isolating Service Functions section to address those conditions. Runtime criteria If an instance of a service is deployed to a system with different runtime constraints, it should be encapsulated in its own telemetry namespace. This can be a deployment to a different datacenter that offers network connectivity advantages to a shared resource, or perhaps the service is running on a separate compute tier with a different memory or thread configuration. These characteristics that affect the code runtime operation can cause different behaviors that lead to different operations behaviors. For example: newrelic.appname = PORTAL_NYC_DC Copy and newrelic.appname = PORTAL_REALLY_BIG_FOOTPRINT Copy Override default agent configuration Tip The New Relic agents provide a variety of options for runtime configuration. Please refer to the agent configuration guide for the options specific to your runtime. Each New Relic APM agent provides a variety of options to modify the default configuration. The most comprehensive and consistent location is the configuration file that accompanies each agent install. However, New Relic agents can also be configured by passing command line parameters directly to the service instance runtime, by using environment variables, or by calling functions within the agent's SDK at runtime. .NET agent configuration options: Using the New Relic .NET SDK API Environment variables Config file options Isolate service functions As the Create an effective service name section indicated, one of the primary objectives of instrumentation is to configure the New Relic agent to group like runtime constraints together as a single named unit. We suggest this because software systems should behave in deterministic ways. For a specific set of inputs, you should get an expected range of measurable outcomes. The degree to which we can comfortably contain these constraints into named service runtime components greatly helps us understand normal behavior and isolate aberrant behavior. Once you have settled on an effective service naming strategy, the next step is to look within the telemetry collected for the service and determine if it suitably isolates the service’s functionality. The implementation pattern we most often encounter is a series of functions being invoked by a web request. The initial receipt and handling of a web request to a service runtime results in the allocation of processing resources. New Relic defines this resource allocation and code execution as a transaction. The New Relic agent is configured with a set of assumptions that create namespaces for transactions as they are detected. Those assumptions differ between the agent language runtime. For example, a good example of how the New Relic Java agent determines the transaction name can be found in the Java agent's transaction naming documentation. However, even after the agent transaction naming protocol has been applied, it may leave you with an unsatisfactory result. By adding additional instrumentation to name the transaction to improve its context, this can greatly improve your understanding of the service’s execution behavior. The goal for transaction naming should be an APM transactions view that provides good segmentation of the services functions in an approach that is easy to understand for a non-developer. New Relic service transaction breakdown view. The transaction breakdown image is a good example of transaction segmentation. It provides detailed tracking of the amount of work being done by each transaction within the broader codebase of the service. It also displays the transaction with a plain user-friendly name that offers some hint of its business context (what the transaction does). As you learn more about naming transactions and including attributes, be sure to make your naming approach accessible for non-technical observers of the data. Transaction breakdown: the transactions in this service seem to be highly weighted to one transaction name with a pretty generic name. Breakdowns like this beg the question: \"Is this a good representation of the work my service does?\" The obtuse transaction breakdown image demonstrates a bad example of transaction name segmentation. In this case we have about 60% of the transaction volume being named OperationHandler/handle. Both the percentage attribution of the transaction volume and the generic nature of the name indicate there might be an overly zealous aggregation of transactions underneath that transaction namespace. A good way to validate your transaction naming approach is to review the distribution of response times for your transaction over a significant period of time in the service web transaction histogram dashboard. The service transaction histogram view shows the count of transactions that fall into each response time bucket. A good naming strategy tends to display a normal distribution. The service transaction image shows a wide range of transaction response rates. Although the bulk of the transactions land in the 0-200 millisecond range, it indicates values ranging from 200-1000 milliseconds. When you have a highly distributed range of responses for a transaction, you should ask yourself: What information do I have during the transaction execution that can help me name this transaction? In many cases, non-normal distributions are a direct result of the parameters being passed to a request, or the work the transaction is being asked to do. It is pretty easy to consider that a service query transaction might take a data range as a parameter. The date range when small might provide a faster lookup time. Therefore, perhaps providing a meaning scheme that is derived from some expected parameter constraints (> 1day, 1-5 days, >5 days) might provide a more meaningful segmentation. Your objective is to create a transaction name that facilitates grouping transactions with the fewest unique characteristics. A more normal distribution of transaction segmentation where individual transactions report more consistent response time attainment with fewer exceptions. The normal distribution image demonstrates more purposefully named transactions within a service. In this case the web transaction response times are more closely grouped, indicating consistent execution characteristics. By ensuring your transaction naming strategy provides a consistent mechanism to group your service’s functions by the types of operations they are performing, you will be able to quickly isolate aberrant behavior, or better understand the root cause of the variations. This will allow you to refactor your application and increase the overall predictability of your service’s functions. Define custom transaction names Tip Consult the New Relic agent API guide for your language agent to review the transaction naming procedure for your runtime. The New Relic agent transaction naming service requires the invocation of a SetName(String name) like API call to the New Relic agent SDK. Each language runtime agent has its own syntax and option for setting the name. For example, to take the value of an http request parameter and use it to name a transaction in the New Relic Java agent, you can use code similar to this: com.newrelic.agent.Agent.LOG.finer(\"[my query handler] Renaming transaction based on an important query parameter\"); com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic.setTransactionName(\"Query Handler_\" + (javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest)_servletrequest_0).getParameter(\"important_query_parm\")); Copy Please note: There is a maximum capacity to transaction names within New Relic. Your transaction naming strategy will have to trade off a degree of specificity if there are thousands of potential transaction names. When too many transaction names are being reported, New Relic will attempt to create rules to group those transaction names. More details can be found in the agent troubleshooting guide related to metric grouping issues. Should you suspect a metric grouping issue, open a support case with New Relic, and we will be happy to work with you to isolate the cause of the transaction naming issue. Capture parameters with your transactions Tip Consult the New Relic agent custom attributes guide for your agent language to review the metadata enhancement options for attribute customization. The transaction name is a powerful way for you to segment your Service’s functionality so that you can better understand its behavior. This allows you to discretely isolate functionality directly in the New Relic UI. However, there are many occasions when you will want to get some additional context on the function of your Service without resorting to isolating the transaction name. This can be accomplished by introducing attribute capture by your Service. You can add name:value pair attributes to decorate the details of each transaction. The attributes will be available in each transaction event through the APM transaction trace and errors UI, or through direct query of parameters from the NRDB transaction event type. After you select a transaction trace, you can view the custom attributes you have set for your Service’s transaction. Here is an example of the transaction trace details you can see in the APM errors UI. Custom attributes displayed in the APM errors UI. If you have developed a useful transaction name segmentation, you can use the additional context of the attributes to better understand the inputs, cohorts, or segments that led to an unexpected result. In addition to being able to understand the context of your transaction within the APM UI, the introduction of parameters is an extremely useful tool to aggregate and analyze transactions by querying transaction data directly. Custom attributes are added to each transaction, making it easy to isolate and facet on specific conditions. NRQL query expression that uses a custom attribute to facet database call duration. The parameter capture approach can also be used with feature flag systems like Split or LaunchDarkly. In this case, as you are implementing the decision handler for the feature flag, consider capturing the flag context (for example, optimized_version = on) that is being applied to the block of code controlling the version or feature the customer sees. NRQL query that demonstrates the result when the state of a feature flag is captured by a transaction custom attribute. The feature flag state attribute allows us to understand the impact of the code execution path on performance, throughput, and dependency utilization. For example, to take the value of an http request parameter and save it as a custom attribute in the New Relic Java agent, you can use code similar to this: com.newrelic.agent.Agent.LOG.finer(\"[my query handler] Adding an Attribute to transaction based on an important query parameter\"); com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic.addCustomParameter(\"ImportantParm\", (javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest)_servletrequest_0).getParameter(\"important_query_parm\")); Copy Component measurement The behavior of a specific transaction within the context of a service is a powerful way to segregate functionality and ensure a software system is operating effectively. However, another way to look at the behavior of a software system is to review the detailed component execution model of its implementation. The application framework code components are shared throughout the service, and the ongoing evaluation of component performance can provide an insight into the overall service health. Within New Relic One there are two places we can observe component execution details. The service summary dashboard in APM provides a view of the composite execution of the service broken down by its component parts (for example, garbage collection execution or database calls). This summary dashboard provides a breakdown of major component types within the application. Memcached, External Web Invocations, MySQL and Dirac are all examples of shared code frameworks that the collective transactions of the Service are using to execute their business logic. A similar breakdown is provided on a transaction by transaction basis. This single transaction summary view breaks out the contributing execution time by component. This helps you see the aggregate performance of components within a transaction. Transaction component segments will tend to demonstrate consistent performance behavior, you can use this consistency to detect a change in its fundamental behavior. This can be a good indication of an underlying issue. Resource constraints tend to manifest more obviously within component frameworks than within individual transaction details. This allows you to infer characteristics of dependencies through the common constraints being experienced by all code running within a service. Ensure your frameworks are measured Tip Consult the New Relic agent instrumentation and SDK guides under the language agent for your service runtime to find information about adding metric names to your instrumentation. The syntax for framework instrustrumentation is specific to the language your service is written in, but the general approach is consistent for all. Consider the threads of execution within your Services as an analogy for transactions within New Relic telemetry. Each method or function execution on the stack is an opportunity to add additional instrumentation. In this way New Relic maintains a time-annotated invocation stack for the transaction and uses those method/function start/stop timings to aggregate it into a series of component metrics. A simple Node.js application making a call to a MongoDB. The two major components of the application are the receipt of the request and get/put operations to the MongoDB. If a particular segment of logic is crucial to the function of your Service or transaction, consider wrapping that call with callbacks to the New Relic agent so that the agent can understand that it has entered a discrete code component and can aggregate the time consumed within that component accordingly. By passing a metric name to the callback, you will create a component segment metric for your service and transaction. The metric naming option is specific to the instrumentation language, so be sure to consult the specific language documentation. The New Relic agents allow you to specify a custom metric name for the instrumentation. The metricName will be used to determine the aggregated metric for the component. The following example demonstrates the metricName parameter being passed to a Java agent SDK @Trace annotation. @Weave public abstract class MQOutboundMessageContext implements OutboundTransportMessageContext { @Trace(dispatcher = true, metricName=\"MQTransport\") public void send(final TransportSendListener listener) throws TransportException { try { NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().setMetricName(\"Message\", \"MQ\", \"Produce\"); MQHelper.processSendMessage(this, NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod()); } catch (Exception e) { NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger().log(Level.FINE, e, \"Unable to set metadata on outgoing MQ message\"); } Weaver.callOriginal(); } } Copy Track every external service call Tip Consult the New Relic agent instrumentation and SDK guides under the language agent for your service runtime to find the details of client library instrumentation. Client instrumentation refers to encapsulating a call from your service to an external resource. Generally, New Relic agents are aware of clients popular for HTTP, gRPC, messaging, and database protocols and will apply the appropriate instrumentation pattern to aggregate calls to those clients as external services. External service dashboard details within New Relic APM. If you have written your own client handler for a protocol, or are using something very new or somewhat niche, the New Relic agent may not recognize the client and record the behavior of the client call. To this end you should verify the external services and databases within APM to represent all expected externalities for your service. Database protocol dashboard details within New Relic APM. It is important to validate that all your services' dependencies are represented here. If you do not see your service dependencies, you will need to introduce new instrumentation to intercept the external call so that your APM agent can track it accordingly. The following example demonstrates wrapping an external call in Node.js for capture by the agent. package main import ( \"net/http\" \"github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic\" ) func currentTransaction() *newrelic.Transaction { return nil } func main() { txn := currentTransaction() client := &http.Client{} request, _ := http.NewRequest(\"GET\", \"http://www.example.com\", nil) segment := newrelic.StartExternalSegment(txn, request) response, _ := client.Do(request) segment.Response = response segment.End() } Copy Examples of other agent API external call tracing: Go ExternalSegment Java ExternalParameters Python external_trace Endpoint testing Endpoint testing provides two benefits to your Service Instrumentation program. Defect detection: By encoding a test for an endpoint that produces a simple true/false result, it allows the operations team to isolate discrete failures to determine if the integrity of service delivery has been compromised. Baselining: Synthetic or machine tests provide a predictable set of conditions that allow you to evaluate the consistency of your service delivery from a control perspective. New Relic’s synthetic monitoring offers the ability to create a variety of testing types by employing an enhanced Selenium JavaScript SDK. Once a Selenium-based test script has been defined, New Relic will manage the location of the script execution as well as its frequency. New Relic synthetics launch dashboard. The synthetic test offers a variety of test options, each with its own focus. For more information see our synthetic monitoring documentation. From the perspective of a Service developer, the monitor type that is most frequently employed is Endpoint availability. This monitor type provides the ability to script http request conditions. These can be as simple as a POST or GET to an accessible API, or involve multiple steps where the Selenium monitoring script successively evaluates requests to ascertain functional integrity of a multi-step process. In practice, developers should consider implementing the simplest possible test to evaluate endpoint availability and integrity. For example, you have just created a new Service endpoint that provides the current exchange rate for a group of currencies. This is a simple GET at an endpoint that returns a JSON object array. Request example: http://example-ip:3000/exchange Response example: [ { \"status\": [ \"quote\" ], \"_id\": \"5b9bf97f61c22f4fb5beb5c9\", \"name\": \"cdn\", \"Created_date\": \"2021-07-12T18:10:07.488Z\", \"__v\": 1 }, { \"status\": [ \"quote\" ], \"_id\": \"5b9bfb2a61c22f4fb5beb5ca\", \"name\": \"usd\", \"Created_date\": \"2021-07-12T18:17:14.224Z\", \"__v\": 0.80 }, { \"status\": [ \"quote\" ], \"_id\": \"5b9bfb3261c22f4fb5beb5cb\", \"name\": \"eur\", \"Created_date\": \"2021-07-12T18:17:22.476Z\", \"__v\": 0.68 }, { \"status\": [ \"quote\" ], \"_id\": \"5b9bfb3761c22f4fb5beb5cc\", \"name\": \"mex\", \"Created_date\": \"2021-07-12T18:17:27.009Z\", \"__v\": 15.97 } ] Copy In order for this service to be considered operational, it needs to respond to requests but also provide the four currency responses. We’re not worried about the content at the moment, just the fact we get four elements back in the array one, for each CDN, USD, EUR and MEX currencies. Using New Relic synthetic monitoring, an API test script could look like the following: /** * This script checks to see if we get the currency data from the endpoint. */ var assert = require('assert'); var myQueryKey = 'secret_key'; var options = { uri: 'http://example_ip:3000/exchange', headers: { 'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey, 'Accept': 'application/json' } }; function callback (err, response, body){ var data = JSON.parse(body); var info = body; if (Array.isArray(data)) { if (data.length !== 4) { assert.fail('Unexpected results in API Call, result was ' + JSON.stringify(data)); } } } $http.get(options, callback); Copy The synthetics script can be directly configured in the New Relic interface, but we highly recommend you maintain your endpoint tests within your source repository system and employ automation. This will help ensure your endpoint testing accompanies the new endpoint dependencies that your Services introduce to production service delivery. Value realization The impact of Service Instrumentation will be directly related to the level of attention you’re willing to invest in overseeing the process. Like the process of monitoring services, your Observability program will benefit through a dedicated team function that thinks critically about its expectations of return for its investment in effort. Here is some guidance to think about the cost of investment for your organization and expectation of benefit. The following section outlines an approach for estimating the investments and returns you should expect by incorporating Service Instrumentation into your Observability practice. Investments Training Ensure all developers are familiar with New Relic agent SDKs and platform capabilities. Cost Model: Dependent on your company's developer FTE model and project estimation. Estimation: Typically a number of hours for a developer to become effective using New Relic instrumentation features. Initial: 16 HRS Training / Exploration Recurring: 4 HRS/Q Review Per developer a yearly investment of 16-40 hours training to develop core skills and maintain skills currency for New Relic platform Development and maintenance The development effort required to implement and maintain instrumentation within a Service project. Cost Model: Dependent on your company's developer FTE model and project estimation. Estimation: This tends to be dependent on the scope of the project and the amount of instrumentation work required. Initial: 8 HRS per developer per service Recurring: 4 HRS/Q Maintenance Per developer a project estimation of 16-32 hours developing and maintaining Service instrumentation Returns AQM impact Alert Quality Management delivers significant benefit to the operations team by ensuring the alert notifications from variant system performance are dealt with swiftly. This improves service delivery and resource allocation during incident remediation. An effective instrumentation practice federated into your observability program will greatly improve your team’s ability to create meaningful alerts. KPIs: Volume: Incident Count Volume: Accumulated Incident Duration Volume: Mean-Time-To-Close (MTTC) User Engagement: Mean Time to Investigate Outcomes: Less alert noise Greater alert and incident responsiveness Less unknown root cause Increased operations productivity Improved service delivery Service quality improvement Improving your service quality will have a direct impact on the key financial metrics for your Service. This will require that you have a well rationalized financial model for your application. Typically this return can be projected by associating a currency value for each percent improvement on a core service quality measure like errors or apdex attainment. As your investment in Service Instrumentation increases, you should see improved attainment on your service quality measures. KPIs: Service Quality (Business KPI) Outcomes: Decreased number of user impacting errors More performant and resilient Service components Service delivery improvement By providing better telemetry from your Service instances, your delivery organization should be able to more quickly detect volatility or downtime and remediate faster. This will lead to better overall service delivery KPIs and decrease episodes of outage or degradation. Cost can be associated with the amount of time it takes to detect, investigate and remediate an incident. This might be related to the value the Service provides your organization that will be lost during an event, or may be related to the general cost to deal with the poorly behaving Service. KPIs: Mean time to detect (MTTD) Mean time to identify (MTTI) Mean time to resolve (MTTR) Outcomes: Decreased time to detect incidents Decreased time to resolve incidents",

      "body": "Page load performance measurement continues to evolve. In order to improve the overall performance and user experience, it helps to understand the different metrics and how they relate to each other. Before following the guidance below, narrow your scope to specific pages that you are trying to improve. For maximum impact, focus on pages that are frequently accessed but have a lower than accepted score for the 75th percentile of users. Page Load KPI How to improve time to first byte (TTFB): Time to first byte measures the time from navigation start (a user clicking a link) to the browser receiving the first byte of the response from the server. If users in the 75th percentile are experiencing a TTFB of greater than 0.5s for one or more of your pages, you can break timings down further by querying the following attributes in PageView: backendDuration connectionSetupDuration dnsLookupDuration networkDuration Frequently slowness prior to rendering is caused by slowness in the backend, either from third party APIs or backend applications. Synthetics monitoring for third party APIs helps operations and development teams understand when the root cause is outside of their control. Even if you cannot control the code, you can influence the outcome by sharing synthetics results with the third party to help them understand what your customers are experiencing. If the backend applications are owned by you or your team, you can use APM agents, Pixie, or OpenTelemetry to understand and manage performance. To make cross team communication easier, we recommend implementing Service Level Management boundaries. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) Cumulative layout shift is a score that indicates how much content shifts once it has already loaded. General tips and tricks for improving CLS: Specify dimensions for stylesheets and let the browser’s default CSS control the aspect ratio. Statically reserve space for ad slots. Avoid ads near the top of the viewport. Avoid inserting new content above existing content. Precompute sufficient space for embeds. Additional resources: Google’s approach to CLS optimization Lighthouse is a tool by Google that runs a synthetic test against a specific page and provides a list of recommendations that include how to optimize CLS. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) Largest contentful paint measures the difference between the start of page render until the time to paint the largest content element. Common causes for a slow lcp, according to web.dev: Slow server response times Render-blocking JavaScript and CSS Slow resource load times Client-side rendering Use Browser session trace information to understand which of the common causes above factor into the particular page you are trying to optimize. Approaches to improve LCP: Making use of CDNs and paying attention to caching and edge server performance Establishing third party connections early Delaying non-critical Javascript and CSS Additional resources: Google’s approach to LCP optimization Lighthouse is a tool by Google that runs a synthetic test against a specific page and provides a list of recommendations that include how to optimize CLS. First Input Delay (FID) First input delay is the time between when a user first interacts with a page to the time when the browser is able to respond. It’s a field metric that varies based on real user behavior (results vary based on user impatience and action timing) but can be optimized by reducing TBT, total blocking time. To do this, you need to: Break up long blocking tasks. Optimize bloated JavaScript. Look at moving logic server side and/or use web workers to run threads in the background. Use Browser session trace information to understand where your blocking intervals are occurring and for how long they last.

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABlE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

      "body": "Access any of your New Relic One dashboards to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data. Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "Access any of your New Relic One dashboards to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data. Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "The Insights Dashboard API is deprecated, but you can use NerdGraph (our GraphQL API) to create and configure dashboards. If you're not migrating from the old Insights API, you can skip this doc and go to the new Dashboards API. Why a new dashboards API? Our Insights product, which was a way to query data and create charts and dashboards, has been deprecated and its set of features moved over to be a core part of the New Relic One platform. To learn more about this transition and new features, see the Insights to New Relic One migration guide. The Insights Dashboard API will be deprecated in July of 2021. Until then, if you're using the Insights Dashboard API, you should attempt to switch over to using NerdGraph. (The Insights query API will not be deprecated but NerdGraph is preferred.) Keep reading to learn how to get started with NerdGraph and learn about equivalent operations. Get started with NerdGraph NerdGraph is the preferred API for making NRQL queries of your New Relic data. Every user who uses NerdGraph needs their own user key. When using NerdGraph, it helps to understand that our dashboards are entities that report data from other entities, such as monitored apps, hosts and services. If you're new to NerdGraph and GraphQL, you may want to first read our Introduction to NerdGraph and some of Create dashboards with NerdGraph. The NerdGraph API explorer is located at api.newrelic.com/graphiql. Operations mapping table The table below maps every Insights API operation to the new dashboards API. Insights API operation NerdGraph API query/mutation Notes List (GET) entitySearch() View a paginated list of dashboards that match the filter. Show (GET) entity() View an existing dashboard given its entity guid. Create (POST) dashboardCreate() Create a new dashboard. Update (PUT) dashboardUpdate() Update an existing dashboard given its entity guid. Delete (DELETE) dashboardDelete() Delete an existing dashboard given its entity guid.

Visualizations mapping table We have simplified our widget visualizations by grouping the ones that were in fact the same but obtained through different types of queries.

By using the NerdGraph API explorer, you can discover GraphQL types and fields, along with a brief explanation. We want to facilitate your migration from the Insights API to the new New Relic One dashboards API. Find below some examples that illustrate how the old REST endpoints map to the new GraphQL queries or mutations. List (GET) -> entitySearch query Dashboards in New Relic One embrace the concept of entity. They are now another entity in New Relic’s entity ecosystem. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. List all dashboard entities you have access to { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by name { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {name: \"My dashboard\"}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by creator’s email { actor { entitySearch(queryBuilder: {type: DASHBOARD, tags: {key: \"createdBy\", value: \"email@domain.com\"}}) { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy List all dashboards by creator’s user id { actor { entitySearch(query: \"type ='DASHBOARD' and ownerId = '2357322'\") { results { entities { ... on DashboardEntityOutline { guid name accountId } } } } } } Copy Show (GET) -> entity query In order to get information on a dashboard, all you need is to provide its unique entity identifier or entity guid. Then you can access all the dashboard properties that you are interested in by adding them in the GraphQL query. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Get dashboard info given its entity guid { actor { entity(guid: \"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { ... on DashboardEntity { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } } Copy Create (POST) -> dashboardCreate mutation Operations that mutate the state of the system are mutations in GraphQL APIs. You can create a dashboard by providing the required input for the dashboardCreate mutation. Although GraphQL APIs aim to be self-explanatory, Nerdgraph docs can help you with some information about the fields, like the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Create dashboard with two pages and two widgets per page mutation { dashboardCreate(accountId: 1, dashboard: { name: \"My awesome dashboard\", permissions: PUBLIC_READ_WRITE, pages: [{ name: \"My first page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.markdown\" }, title: \"My markdown widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { text: \"#My markdown\" } }, { visualization: { id: \"viz.line\" }, title: \"My line widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 5, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" }] } }] }, { name: \"My second page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.billboard\" }, title: \"My billboard widget with thresholds\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction\" }], thresholds: [{ alertSeverity: WARNING, value: 650 }, { alertSeverity: CRITICAL, value: 1500 }] } }, { visualization: { id: \"viz.table\" }, title: \"My table widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 5, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\", accountId: 1 }] } }] }] }) { errors { description type } entityResult { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } Copy Update (PUT) -> dashboardUpdate mutation The dashboardUpdate mutation allows you to update an existing dashboard by providing the existing dashboard guid and the new configuration. Similarly to creating a dashboard, the mutation tries to be self-explanatory, but you can look up the doc about how to build dashboard widgets. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Update previously created dashboard to 1 page and 1 widget per page mutation { dashboardUpdate(guid: \"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\" dashboard: { name: \"My awesome dashboard\", permissions: PUBLIC_READ_WRITE, pages: [{ name: \"My first page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.line\" }, title: \"My line widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ accountId: 1, query: \"SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET appName TIMESERIES\" }] } }] }, { name: \"My second page\", widgets: [{ visualization: { id: \"viz.table\" }, title: \"My table widget\", layout: { row: 1, column: 1, width: 4, height: 3 }, rawConfiguration: { nrqlQueries: [{ query: \"SELECT * FROM Transaction\", accountId: 1 }] } }] }] }) { errors { description type } entityResult { guid accountId name createdAt updatedAt permissions description owner { email userId } pages { guid name createdAt updatedAt description owner { email userId } widgets { id visualization { id } title layout { row column height width } rawConfiguration linkedEntities { guid } } } } } } Copy Delete (DELETE) -> dashboardDelete mutation The dashboardDelete mutation allows you to delete an existing dashboard by providing its entity guid. Try it out using the NerdGraph GraphiQL explorer. Delete previously created dashboard mutation { dashboardDelete(guid:\"MY_DASHBOARD_GUID\") { status errors { type description } } } Copy",

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABlE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

      "body": "Access any of your New Relic One dashboards to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data. Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABlE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

      "body": "Access any of your New Relic One dashboards to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data. Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "Envision your data as a complex system of roads: you need to navigate the signs and signals along the way to quickly see and make meaning of the information you collect. New Relic One dashboards gather and chart the specific data you want to see, the way you want to see it, from anywhere in the New Relic platform. Why it matters With New Relic One dashboards you can customize and understand the data you collect. Explore your data and correlate connected sources with tailored, user-friendly charts, and quickly learn the state of your system and applications for faster, more efficient troubleshooting. Use dashboards to: Drive insight with custom, high-density interactive visualizations with a consistent UI. View dashboards across your organization using cross-account search. Chart all the events and attributes from everywhere across our platform. For more information, see Data collection. Add custom attributes or send custom event types to most events in order to better understand your business, and see specific details about how your customers interact with your platform, such as page views, host transactions, etc. Manage your charts and dashboards easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options. Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom-in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time. Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics. Send data to your dashboards using our APIs. Transitioning from Insights Switching to using New Relic One dashboards from our deprecated Insights dashboards? See our transition guide. If you're using the Insights Dashboard API, we have have a migration guide that will help you transition to using the new API. Get started with dashboards To access dashboards, go to one.newrelic.com and click on Dashboards on the top navigation menu. In the dashboards index, you can view all the dashboards and data apps associated with your New Relic account. From the top bar, quickly access our explorer as well as all New Relic capabilities, such as APM, Browser and Infrastructure monitoring, Logs, or Applied Intelligence. You can also use the core New Relic One features such as Search or Query your data that are available across the platform. For each dashboard, the index displays the following information: Favorite status, indicated by a star Name: The name of the dashboard Account: The account the dashboard belongs to Created by: The user who created the dashboard Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified Created on: When the dashboard was created Here you can carry out the following actions: Create a dashboard You can easily create a dashboard in New Relic One from the dashboards index by selecting the + Create a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. Tip By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By duplicating an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Import a dashboard You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the Import a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index: Paste the JSON code. By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it. By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different rights if you want to change them. Tip See how to obtain a dashboard’s JSON. Duplicate a dashboard Duplicate any dashboard by clicking the Duplicate dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can duplicate any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the duplicate will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your duplicated dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can duplicate it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. Everything but the metadata is hidden. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by duplicating another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see Build a custom visualization for dashboards and Add custom visualizations to your dashboards.",

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABlE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

      "body": "Access any of your New Relic One dashboards to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data. Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABlE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

      "body": "Envision your data as a complex system of roads: you need to navigate the signs and signals along the way to quickly see and make meaning of the information you collect. New Relic One dashboards gather and chart the specific data you want to see, the way you want to see it, from anywhere in the New Relic platform. Why it matters With New Relic One dashboards you can customize and understand the data you collect. Explore your data and correlate connected sources with tailored, user-friendly charts, and quickly learn the state of your system and applications for faster, more efficient troubleshooting. Use dashboards to: Drive insight with custom, high-density interactive visualizations with a consistent UI. View dashboards across your organization using cross-account search. Chart all the events and attributes from everywhere across our platform. For more information, see Data collection. Add custom attributes or send custom event types to most events in order to better understand your business, and see specific details about how your customers interact with your platform, such as page views, host transactions, etc. Manage your charts and dashboards easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options. Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom-in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time. Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics. Send data to your dashboards using our APIs. Transitioning from Insights Switching to using New Relic One dashboards from our deprecated Insights dashboards? See our transition guide. If you're using the Insights Dashboard API, we have have a migration guide that will help you transition to using the new API. Get started with dashboards To access dashboards, go to one.newrelic.com and click on Dashboards on the top navigation menu. In the dashboards index, you can view all the dashboards and data apps associated with your New Relic account. From the top bar, quickly access our explorer as well as all New Relic capabilities, such as APM, Browser and Infrastructure monitoring, Logs, or Applied Intelligence. You can also use the core New Relic One features such as Search or Query your data that are available across the platform. For each dashboard, the index displays the following information: Favorite status, indicated by a star Name: The name of the dashboard Account: The account the dashboard belongs to Created by: The user who created the dashboard Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified Created on: When the dashboard was created Here you can carry out the following actions: Create a dashboard You can easily create a dashboard in New Relic One from the dashboards index by selecting the + Create a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. Tip By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By duplicating an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Import a dashboard You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the Import a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index: Paste the JSON code. By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it. By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different rights if you want to change them. Tip See how to obtain a dashboard’s JSON. Duplicate a dashboard Duplicate any dashboard by clicking the Duplicate dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can duplicate any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the duplicate will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your duplicated dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can duplicate it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. Everything but the metadata is hidden. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by duplicating another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see Build a custom visualization for dashboards and Add custom visualizations to your dashboards.",

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABlE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

      "body": "Access any of your New Relic One dashboards to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data. Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "Envision your data as a complex system of roads: you need to navigate the signs and signals along the way to quickly see and make meaning of the information you collect. New Relic One dashboards gather and chart the specific data you want to see, the way you want to see it, from anywhere in the New Relic platform. Why it matters With New Relic One dashboards you can customize and understand the data you collect. Explore your data and correlate connected sources with tailored, user-friendly charts, and quickly learn the state of your system and applications for faster, more efficient troubleshooting. Use dashboards to: Drive insight with custom, high-density interactive visualizations with a consistent UI. View dashboards across your organization using cross-account search. Chart all the events and attributes from everywhere across our platform. For more information, see Data collection. Add custom attributes or send custom event types to most events in order to better understand your business, and see specific details about how your customers interact with your platform, such as page views, host transactions, etc. Manage your charts and dashboards easily using our quick-access CRUD menus and editing options. Explore and contextualize data with advanced tooltips and zoom-in functions to monitor what your systems are doing in real time. Search your dashboards for attributes and metrics. Send data to your dashboards using our APIs. Transitioning from Insights Switching to using New Relic One dashboards from our deprecated Insights dashboards? See our transition guide. If you're using the Insights Dashboard API, we have have a migration guide that will help you transition to using the new API. Get started with dashboards To access dashboards, go to one.newrelic.com and click on Dashboards on the top navigation menu. In the dashboards index, you can view all the dashboards and data apps associated with your New Relic account. From the top bar, quickly access our explorer as well as all New Relic capabilities, such as APM, Browser and Infrastructure monitoring, Logs, or Applied Intelligence. You can also use the core New Relic One features such as Search or Query your data that are available across the platform. For each dashboard, the index displays the following information: Favorite status, indicated by a star Name: The name of the dashboard Account: The account the dashboard belongs to Created by: The user who created the dashboard Last edited: When the dashboard was last modified Created on: When the dashboard was created Here you can carry out the following actions: Create a dashboard You can easily create a dashboard in New Relic One from the dashboards index by selecting the + Create a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index. Name your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name (your service or application, for instance) using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily. Select the account the dashboard belongs to. Choose carefully because this action cannot be modified. Press Create to continue, or Cancel to return to the index. Tip By default a dashboard is created with Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit them from the settings menu once you access the dashboard. Alternatively, you can also create a new dashboard: By duplicating an existing dashboard. From any chart: Copy any chart from any dashboard to a new or an existing dashboard. From the data explorer or the query builder: Add any chart you create from our querying features to a new or an existing dashboard. From the explorer: Take any custom view from the entity manager over to dashboards. To organize dashboards with multiple pages, see Add pages to a dashboard. Import a dashboard You can import a dashboard as JSON by selecting the Import a dashboard button located at the top-right corner of the dashboards index: Paste the JSON code. By default, the dashboard belongs to the same account as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select a different account if you want to change it. By default, the new dashboard has the same rights as the original dashboard you’re importing. Select different rights if you want to change them. Tip See how to obtain a dashboard’s JSON. Duplicate a dashboard Duplicate any dashboard by clicking the Duplicate dashboard button that appears when you hover over any dashboard row in the index. You can duplicate any dashboard regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. Access the new dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word \"copy\". For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named this is my dashboard, the duplicate will be created as this is my dashboard copy. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, like the permissions, at any time. Tip The index displays dashboards according to sorting. To quickly find your duplicated dashboard, sort the dashboards by creation date. The new dashboard appears on top. Delete a dashboard To delete a dashboard, hover over the dashboard row at the index until the Delete button appears. You can only delete a dashboard if you created it, or if it has Public - Read and write permissions. For more information, see the permissions information. You can also delete a dashboard from the settings panel of the dashboard. Mark a dashboard as favorite Clicking the star icon next to a dashboard toggles on or off the favorites. When you favorite a dashboard, it’s grouped with other favorite dashboards at the top of the list, and appears on the New Relic One home page. To remove a dashboard from your favorites, select the star icon again. New Relic One doesn’t retrieve favorited dashboards from Insights. Learn how to make the transition from Insights to New Relic One. Search and sort dashboards You can search dashboards by dashboard name and author using the search box above the index. You can also sort the dashboards in the index. By default, dashboards you edited recently are at the top of the index in both the favorited and non-favorited sections. To change this order, you can sort both sections by any of the columns in the index, your most recent sort is displayed next time you access New Relic One. Dashboard permissions Dashboards have three types of permissions: Public - Read and write: All users have full rights to the dashboard. Public - Read only: All users are able to see the dashboard, but only you have full rights to work with the dashboard. Other users can access the dashboard but are not able to edit or delete it, although they can duplicate it. Private: Only you can see the dashboard. Everything but the metadata is hidden. When you create a dashboard using the Create a dashboard button or by duplicating another dashboard, it will have Public - Read and write rights by default. Access the new dashboard to change this setting. Organize your dashboards with tags You can add tags using our NerdGraph, our tagging API. You can also filter your dashboards by tags, which you can use to identify users, accounts, locations, etc. Click on the tag filter to see the available tags, you can easily select one or more tags from the list to narrow down the dashboards in the index. Key visual tools Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting. Consistent chart coloring So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts. Correlated needle When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart. Data scrubber The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other. Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI. Brush to zoom Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard. The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time. Custom visualizations You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see Build a custom visualization for dashboards and Add custom visualizations to your dashboards.",

      "body": "The New Relic platform is built around the four fundamental telemetry data types we believe are necessary for complete and effective system monitoring: metrics, events, logs, and traces. Get started This doc will give you a fairly technical explanation of our core data types, their structure, and how they're used in our features. You can use most of our features without needing to understand the underlying data structure. But having a better understanding of this can help you get data into New Relic, understand the data you see in our UI, and query your data. For a simpler explanation of these data types using real-world examples, see Introduction to essential telemetry data types. Another good way to understand your data is to just start querying it. Tip Access your data easily on one.newrelic.com: Click the Browse data dropdown menu and select the data type (metrics, events, logs, and traces) you want to explore. Metrics First, we’ll explain the definition of metrics from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain how New Relic handles metrics. For a list of the metrics we collect, see our documentation on metrics. Metrics in the monitoring industry In the software monitoring industry, a metric means a numeric measurement of an application or system. Metrics are typically reported on a regular schedule. Two major types of metrics are: Aggregated data. For example: a count of events over one minute’s time, or the rate of some event per minute. A numeric status at a moment in time. For example: a CPU temperature reading, or a “CPU% used” status. Metrics are relatively easy to report and store because a single record can represent a range of time. They can also be aggregated more and more over time. For example, per-minute data may be “rolled up” to per-hour aggregations after some amount of time, and eventually may be rolled up to a per-day aggregation. This approach is efficient for long-term data storage. Metrics are a strong solution for storing data long-term, and understanding trends over time. One potential downside is that it can be difficult to do detailed analysis of older data that has been aggregated over time; when high detail is required about specific important actions, event data can be used. Metrics at New Relic Conceptually, \"metrics\" is a broad, general category. There are various ways New Relic measures and reports metrics but, in practice, when using the New Relic UI, you usually won't have to understand how exactly this happens. In our documentation, we typically will just refer to \"metrics,\" regardless of how that data is reported, unless there's a reason you need to know more (like understanding how to query your data). Here are some of the ways metrics are reported and stored across the New Relic platform: Dimensional metrics (used by Metric API and many integrations) In the monitoring industry, \"dimensional\" metrics refer to metric data that has a variety of attributes (dimensions) attached, such as duration-related attributes (start time, end time), entity ID, region, host, etc. This amount of detail allows for in-depth analysis and querying. At New Relic, this metric data is attached to the Metric data type and is sent from several sources: Some open-source integrations, like our Prometheus and OpenCensus exporters Our Telemetry SDKs Infrastructure services The Metric API (the underlying API used by the above tools) The events-to-metrics service To query this data and see its attributes (\"dimensions\"), you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Metric Copy As time passes, these metrics are increasingly aggregated into larger time buckets. This is done to optimize your ability to query data over a long period of time. For more details about the metric data type, see our docs. To learn how this data is ingested and stored, see the Metric API documentation. For tips on querying, see Metric query examples. Metric timeslice data (used by APM, browser, mobile) New Relic's APM, browser, and mobile report and display metrics in a simple data format that we refer to as metric timeslice data. A metric timeslice consists of three parts: a metric name, the segment of time the metric represents (the \"timeslice\"), and a numeric value (the measurement). For example: an APM metric timeslice for time spent in a particular transaction is named WebTransaction/URI/foo, and might have a response time of 0.793 for a one-minute time slice from 10:20am to 10:21am. These metrics usually follow a pattern like <category>/<class>/<method>. Our agents (APM, browser, and mobile) can collect thousands of metric timeslices per minute for a variety of performance metrics. For example: error rate, bandwidth usage, and garbage collection time. You also have the ability to create custom metrics. Metric timeslice data is a lightweight data type and lacks the detail that dimensional metrics have. Ways to explore and query metric timeslice data: For APM: metric timeslice data is converted to dimensional metrics and can be queried via NRQL Use the REST API If you want to learn more about the structure of metric timeslice data and see some examples, expand the collapser below. Metric timeslice examples Here are some common metric timeslice data examples, with a focus on common ones used by Ruby applications. ActiveMerchant New Relic tracks a variety of metrics on ActiveMerchant transactions which can be used for business analytics as well as performance monitoring. The metrics are summarized by operation as well as by gateway. regex sample metric legend name ActiveMerchant/. * ActiveMerchant/PayJunctionGateway ActiveMerchant/gateway/. * ActiveMerchant/gateway/PayJunctionGateway/purchase PayJunctionGateway ActiveMerchant/operation/. * ActiveMerchant/operation/purchase purchase For more information, see the ActiveMerchant website. ActiveRecord ActiveRecord is the Object-Relational Mapping API used by Ruby on Rails applications. The metrics shown here measure the performance of ActiveRecord's find and save methods. regex sample metric legend name ActiveRecord/. * /find ActiveRecord/User/find User#find ActiveRecord/. * /save ActiveRecord/Product/save Product#save For more information, see the API documentation for ActiveRecord. Apdex Apdex is a measure of user satisfaction with page load times. Controller In Ruby on Rails applications, HTTP requests are handled by Controller actions. A Rails application has many controllers, each of which has one or more actions. When your rails application receives an http request, that request is routed to the appropriate controller and action, based on the URL of that request. That action then does whatever processing is neccesary to generate an http response, which is most often a web page, but could also be a page fragment, an xml document, or any other kind of data that is requested by the client. The following metrics track the performance of controller actions, regardless of routing, and without taking into account any network or web server effects. regex sample metric legend name Controller/. * Controller/Users/show /Users/show Controller/. * /(?! \\ (other \\ )). * Controller/Users/show /Users/show Controller$ Controller All Controller Actions ControllerCPU/ ControllerCPU/Users/Show /Users/show For more information, see the API documentation for ActionController. Errors This metric tracks the number of errors or exceptions raised while processing requests. regex sample metric legend name Errors/all Errors/all External services External service instrumentation captures calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud and any other network calls. It does not include other first class back-end components such as MemCache and the database. In Ruby applications we instrument the Net::Http library to capture all HTTP services. regex sample metric legend name External/ [ ^/]+/all$ External/service.example.com/all All service.example.com calls External/ External/host.aws.com/Net::Http : :POST Net::Http : :POST [ host.aws.com] External/all$ External/all External Services External/ [ ^/]+/(?!all)/ External/service.example.com/all All service.example.com calls HTTP dispatcher This metric represents a summary of the throughput and response time of all web requests. regex sample metric legend name ^HttpDispatcher$ HttpDispatcher HttpDispatcher MemCache MemCache is a popular technology that enables applications to access shared memory provided by any number of physical machines as a global cache. Applications that heavily use the database often use MemCache for performance and scalability benefits. These metrics measure the frequency and response time of calls to MemCache to read and write data from the cache. Response times should be low (less than 5 ms) for a well performing MemCache deployment. regex sample metric legend name MemCache/. * MemCache/read MemCache read operations MemCache/read MemCache/read MemCache read operations MemCache/write MemCache/write MemCache write operations Mongrel This metric measures the length of the mongrel queue, which holds pending http requests to be processed by mongrel. The HTTP Activity graph overlays the maximimum queue length for a given period. The value is zero if mongrel is processing a request but has no other requests waiting in its queue. When looking at this value across an aggregate cluster of mongrels, the queue lengths of all mongrels is added together, showing the sum of all queue lengths. A mongrel queue length should be at or near zero; if it is consistently at a higher level, then it indicates that your rails application is having trouble keeping up with its load requirements. regex sample metric legend name Mongrel/Queue Length Mongrel/Queue Length Queue Length View ActionView is a package in Rails that is used to render the output that is the response to an http request, such as an html page or an xml document. The View is rendered by the controller that is handling the request. If View metrics represent a large portion of your controller's response time, it could mean you are doing a lot of database operations inside the view template itself. regex sample metric legend name View/. * View/Users/ _ child.html.erb/Partial Users/ _ child.html.erb View/. * /Partial View/Users/ _ child.html.erb/Partial Users/ _ child.html.erb View/. * /Rendering View/Users/show.html.erb/Rendering Users/show.html.erb For more information, see the API documentation for ActionView. Metrics attached to events (used by Infrastructure, other products) Because event-type data can have any type of key-value pair data attached to it, one way metrics can be reported is as attributes attached to an event. A couple examples of this at New Relic: Our infrastructure monitoring reports many metrics that are attached to events. For example, we report a ProcessSample event, which has various sample-based metrics attached to it, like CPU percentage. To learn more about infrastructure monitoring data, see Infrastructure data. In APM, the Transaction event has several metrics attached to it, including databaseDuration. To learn more about this data and how to query it, see Events. Metrics as a computation of events (used in some charts and queries) Metrics can be formed by counting New Relic events, or doing some other mathematical calculation on those events. For example, if you wanted to measure the total number of Transaction events over the last half hour, you might run this NRQL query: Select count(*) from Transaction since 30 minutes ago Copy Another example: if you wanted to compute the average response time for your service, you might run a query like: FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) SINCE 30 minutes ago Copy Some New Relic charts are generated with these kinds of queries. The downside of this approach is that there are limits on how many events a monitoring system (including ours) can report. This means that sometimes, for high-throughput systems, the count may not accurately represent the total activity on that system. To learn more about how this can be addressed, see Event limits and sampling. Want to report custom metrics? See Get data into New Relic. Event data First, we’ll explain the definition of events from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain some specifics about how New Relic handles event data. Events in the monitoring industry In the software industry, events can be thought of as simply “things that occur in a system.” For example, a server setting being changed would be an event. Another example: a website user clicking a mouse. Some events will generate a stored record, and that record is typically also called an event. Event data represents discrete occurrences and typically will have a high level of detail, so event data is suited for detailed analysis and querying. The downside to the use of event data is that there are typically so many events reported that it can become difficult to query that large dataset over longer time ranges. Events at New Relic At New Relic, we report events to data objects also called events. These events have multiple attributes (key-value pairs) attached. Event data is used in some UI charts and tables, and you can also query it. How long event data remains available is determined by data retention rules. One example of an event: APM reports an event type named Transaction, which represents a logical unit of work in an application. To see the attributes attached to this event, you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Transaction Copy For examples of querying event data, see Introduction to NRQL. Other details about New Relic event data: Events can have any type of attributes attached. Some events have attributes that report metric data. You can report custom events. To increase the availability of your event data for querying/charting, you can turn events into metrics. Some systems generate a large number of events that exceeds collection limits and results in incomplete query results. For more on this, see Event sampling. Because event is a general term, in some New Relic contexts it will refer to any data type that can be queried via NRQL. For example, when you run a NRQL query, it returns a count of inspected events: this is a count of all data types queried. Log data First, we’ll explain the definition of logs from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain some specifics about how New Relic handles log reporting. Logs in the monitoring industry A log is a message about a system used to understand the activity of the system and to diagnose problems. Logs at New Relic New Relic's Logs gives you a centralized log management platform that connects your log data with other New Relic-monitored data. For example, you can see logs alongside your APM data. In New Relic, log data is reported with multiple attributes (key-value data) attached. To query your log data, you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Log Copy To report custom log data, see the Log API. Trace data First, we’ll explain the definition of traces from a monitoring industry perspective, and then we’ll explain some specifics about how New Relic handles tracing. Tracing in the monitoring industry In the application/infrastructure-monitoring world, tracing is a general term used to refer to various ways to report information about how a program or system is operating. For example, a stack trace provides in-depth information about a program’s subroutines. For large modern systems, which are often distributed across many services and micro-services, “tracing” often refers to distributed tracing, which is a way to monitor requests as they propagate through a complex, distributed environment. Tracing at New Relic New Relic offers a distributed tracing feature that tracks requests across a distributed system, and provides a dedicated UI for understanding and analyzing your traces. In New Relic, trace data is reported as Span objects, with multiple attributes (key-value pairs) attached. To query your tracing data, you could use a NRQL query like: Select * from Span Copy To learn more about how distributed tracing works, see Understand distributed tracing. To report custom distributed tracing data, see the Trace API.

Metric types The metric type determines how the data is aggregated over longer time windows. It also determines which functions you can use to query the data. Metric types Description Available query functions count Measures the number of occurrences of an event. The count should be reset to 0 every time the metric is reported. Examples include cache hits per reporting interval and the number of threads created per reporting interval. You must specify a value for interval.ms when reporting the count metric type using the Metric API. The value must be a positive double. Generally, you want to take the rate of the sum: From Metric select rate(sum(myMetric), 1 minute) . . . sum distribution Tracks the statistical distribution on a numeric attribute. This metric is re-aggregatable. For example, 1-minute data points from 60 minutes can be aggregated into a 1-hour data point, without degradation on accuracy. This type: Supports statistical functions like percentile and histogram, and all functions supported by the summary type. Uses the same algorithm as the percentile function. percentile histogram min max sum count average gauge Represents a value that can increase or decrease with time. Examples of gauges include the temperature, CPU usage, and memory. For example, there is always a temperature, but you are periodically taking the temperature and reporting it. The value must fit into the range of a Java double. latest min max sum count average summary Used to report pre-aggregated data, or information on aggregated discrete events. A summary includes a count, sum value, min value, and max value. The count value must be positive. Examples include transaction count/durations and queue count/ durations.

This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABlE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABlE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select.

Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABlE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

      "body": "Access any of your New Relic One dashboards to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data. Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

      "body": "Access any of your New Relic One dashboards to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data. Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "When you connect your data to New Relic, we process what we receive and apply data dropping and transformation rules. Then we count the bytes needed to represent your data in a standard format, like JSON. If you're on our New Relic One pricing plan, you're charged by the number of bytes written to our database, above and beyond the standard amount that’s free. Important This doc is for accounts on our New Relic One pricing plan. If you're on our original product-based pricing plan, see Original data retention. Not sure which you're on? See Overview of pricing and user model. The Data ingestion page shows your ingest rates for a period you specify on the top-right of the Data management hub. Since 30 days ago is the default setting, but you can also set a custom date span. The page shows your daily average GBs, and the total for the range you set. You can toggle between an overall ingest view and an account view to identify which of your accounts are sending the most data. The page also provides the current month-to-date, and the projected end-of-month total ingest rates. With this information, you can proactively drop data or turn off agents in order to manage ingest and, therefore, costs. If you want to take a look at how we query the data, click the ellipsis icon (just above the chart) to slide out the chart query and open it in our query builder. And If you want to drill down further into your data usage, check out the sample queries in the usage docs. From the Login drop-down, select Manage your data, and then select Data ingestion. This is the Data ingestion page with data source and account views. Data ingestion sources The Data ingestion page describes which of your data sources provide the most data on average and during specific data ranges. The sources are described here. Billable data sources Description Timeslices (1-minute) and Metric:Raw Metrics are timeslices + MetricRaw Metric group: MetricsBytes Metric timeslice data averages to one-hour periods after eight days. After 90 days, the permanent metric data continues to be stored in one-hour periods. We currently store the raw metric data for 30 days. You are only billed for the initial ingest volume. You are not billed for subsequent rollups. APM (transactions and errors) APM events Metric group: ApmEventsBytes InfraSamples:Raw Includes multiple Infrastructure events Infrastructure host data Metric group:InfraHostBytes Information related to your servers and virtual machines coming from infrastructure agents, including storage and network data Infrastructure process data stored in ProcessSample. Metric group: InfraProcessBytes Data are metrics related to each process running on the hosts running the Infrastructure agent. This feature is turned off by default. Infrastructure integrations Metric group: InfraIntegrationBytes Performance data related to applications and services, typically managed by the customer, including data related to Docker containers, Windows services, Nagios checks, and cloud integrations such as managed services in AWS, Azure, and GCP. Logging Includes logs and any Log_<value> custom data partition created Metric group: LoggingBytes Log records are stored into the Log event type by default. Additional custom data partitions will create new event types, which are always prefixed with Log_ and will be counted as part of the overall set of log data stored. With LogExtendedRecord, log messages longer than 4KB are split into multiple events that, when needed, are stitched together to display the original message; this reduces the size of message data. As of September 2021, log storage as blobs replaces LogExtendedRecord. With blob storage, NRDB can store up to 128,000 bytes for any attribute, not just messages. For more information, see our blobs documentation for logs. Default Custom events Metric group: CustomEventsBytes Mobile error Mobile general Breadcrumb crash event trails Mobile session Mobile exception Mobile crash Mobile events Metric group: MobileEventsBytes Tracing Metric group: TracingBytes TracingBytes includes Span and OpenTelemetry's SpanEvent. You are not charged for DistributedTraceSummary events. Browser:EventLog Browser Browser:JSErrors PcvPerf (PageView timing) Browser events Metric group: BrowserEventsBytes Lambda Serverless Metric group: ServerlessBytes Break down data to see what's contributing to your ingest You can inspect your data ingest to gain more information about your ingest health. This way, you'll know your baselines, and can more easily spot an anomaly like an ingest spike, as well as its source. To break down your ingested data, start from the chart on the Data ingestion page. Think of the data source bands as the Y axis, and the dates as the X axis. Click on the band you want to inspect at the spot in the X axis that corresponds with the date you want to investigate. This image shows the Metrics band for June 15 right before it's clicked. A modal opens with the account, data source, and facet selected. You can do a handful of things on this page: Change the account, data source, or facet you want to drill down into. Change the date and time to investigate. Review the results of the query in chart form. The chart displays the top 15 results for the facet query. Open the NRQL query in the Query builder where you'll find additional facets that you can use. Learn more about NRQL queries here. How we break your ingest data down Some of the content in the UI is variable, depending on your account. This information is intended to help you understand how we're working with your ingest data. The chart on the Data ingestion page shows data usage for a little longer time frame than that covered by your retention settings for each data ingest source. If you choose a date outside of your designated retention period for an ingest source, you'll get the message that there's no chart data available. Select a more recent date to fix this problem. If you inspect a data source for an account that has less than a terrabyte of data, we compute the ingest volume over a 24 hour period; otherwise, we compute it for a 1 hour period. The ingest value provided on the main Data ingestion chart will be slightly different from that reflected during inspection. This is because our facet computation is an estimate. Set alerts for data use Query and alert on usage data describes how to set alerts to get notified if you're nearing data ingest limits you don't want to cross. For example, you might set an alert on logs, which can stack up quickly in an active system. Adjust your data ingest Drop data for lower retention costs and data compliance On ingest, we apply data dropping rules so you won't be charged for data that's not useful. Learn how to set additional data dropping rules yourself. Use NerdGraph to drop entire data types or drop data attributes from data types so they’re not written to NRDB. This enables you to focus on the data you want, reduces retention costs, and avoids writing sensitive data to the database. For dropping log data, see Drop data with drop filter rules. Turn off agents and integrations If you don’t need data from specific agents or integrations that you have installed, you can uninstall/delete those tools. For instructions, see the specific documentation for an agent or integration.",

      "body": "With real time streaming, your APM event data is sent to New Relic every five seconds. You can query and visualize your data for transactions, errors, and custom events in near real time. The smaller payloads result in faster chart refreshes and faster queries of data that is the most important to you. No configuration is needed to take advantage of real time streaming. All you need to do is ensure your APM agent version is up to date. Why it matters Real time streaming doesn't result in more events being sent. The combination of more frequent posts, with a smaller number of events per post, results in approximately the same number of events per minute as there would be without real time streaming. The following image shows a comparison between data sent to New Relic with and without real time streaming. Note that 10,000 is an example number of events; some agents have lower default limits. The overall limits on how many events can be sent per minute haven't changed. Also, non-event data (spans, traces, and metrics) are unaffected; they're still sent every minute. Use real time streaming to quickly understand the impact when something has changed, such as deploying a new app version. Examine key performance indicators (throughput, error rates, charting, etc.) in near real time. Respond quickly to failure conditions and anomalies. Get the most out of New Relic One dashboards. Reduce mean time to detection with APM events reporting every five seconds. Agent version to automatically enable To enable real time streaming, update to the latest APM agent. You don't need to configure anything to enable real time streaming; it will automatically report faster! Real time streaming is supported by all APM agents. Here are the minimum agent versions: C SDK: v1.3.0 or higher Go: v2.8.0 or higher Java: v5.5.0 or higher .NET: v8.23.107.0 or higher Node.js: v5.13.0 or higher PHP: v9.5.0.252 or higher Python: v5.2.0.127 or higher Ruby: v6.7.0.359 or higher Caution If Transaction event reporting is disabled, this can affect some UI elements throughout New Relic. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data. Query real time streaming data When building charts, include the following in your NRQL query: NRQL clause Comments SINCE 5 minutes ago Be sure to add a SINCE 5 minutes ago clause to your NRQL query in order to take advantage of the 5 second chart refresh interval. This is because the chart's refresh interval is based on the time window. TIMESERIES bucket To set the refresh interval for time series charts, you can also specify the bucket size as an optional argument to the TIMESERIES clause. For example, SINCE 30 minutes ago TIMESERIES 5 seconds will display a 30 minute window at a 5 second resolution. You can have a maximum of 366 buckets. Create real time streaming charts You can visualize the results of your NRQL query in New Relic One: Go to one.newrelic.com, and at the top of the page, select Query your data. Use the data explorer to start building a chart. Select the advanced (NRQL) mode to refine your query. In your NRQL query, adjust the SINCE and TIMESERIES clauses to take advantage of the 5 second refresh intervals.",

With the current implementation, a data type must have a single data source assigned. This isn't ideal, as theoretically a data type can come from multiple sources. Add a new data type To add a new data type: Make a new folder in this directory, alongside the other directories: src/data-dictionary/events Copy Duplicate a data type file (for example, this Metric data type), place it in the new folder, and fill it out with the new info. For how to add attributes on a new data type, keep reading. Add attributes To add attributes: Check if there's an existing attribute that has the same name and same general definition as the one you're trying to add. If it exists, edit that file to include the new data type (under events:). If an existing attribute is fairly close in definition but not exact, try to edit the definition so it works for all associated data types. If there is no existing attribute, create a new one. The easiest way is to copy an existing attribute file, edit all relevant fields to be accurate, and place it in the folder of the data type it's attached to (for example, Transaction). When writing an attribute, try to keep it as concise as possible, and avoid using links. For more on that, see Style. If the attribute has one of the units of measurement we use (like units: percentage (%)), add that to the front matter. For info on units, see Units. Attribute style guidelines When adding or editing attributes, some things to keep in mind: Aim for concise descriptions. Notes on this: Feel free to use sentence fragments. Feel free to edit definitions submitted from internal teams as sometimes their definitions will be overly long or have unneeded links. Some attributes are only present in some situations (for example, when a specific APM agent is used, or when a specific config option is true). We should avoid documenting most of these, with the idea that most customers will only care about the data because it's being reported for them, and won't care about the things that factor into the reasons why it wouldn't be reported. If it's thought that the addition would help customers who already have the data reporting understand the data better, you can include it. Write so it reads well as plain text. Details on this: Note that the docs site data dictionary has our usual docs styles available, but the query UI definitions have no styling available. This means that you should write definitions so that they are understandable without any styling, as plain text. You can often avoid any need for styling (for example, data types like Transaction are easy to understand as plain text, as are most phrasings that use attribute names or values. When plain text makes something too ambiguous and you need some styling, use back ticks to indicate attributes or values (for example, a definition like: Reported when ` category ` is ` http ` ). Using this also sets us up for success if we implement styling in the UI definitions in the future. We should avoid links because those aren't visible in the query UI; the query UI only displays plain text. However, every attribute entry in the query UI does display a 'See attribute in docs' link that links to the complete and normally formatted docs site entry. This means that we can use links provided that they will display in an easy to understand way in the query UI. For example, here's an example of an attribute that would read clearly in plain text despite not having a link. We should avoid using a link format like \"For more information, see Create an alert condition\", because it wouldn't read well in plain text, and would choose something like \"For more information, see our alert condition docs.\" Using units of measurement Attribute entries have an optional unit of measurement field in the front matter. For example, here the front matter for an attribute with a percent unit of measurement: --- name: cpuPercent type: attribute units: percentage (%) events: - ProcessSample --- Copy What unit of measurement to select for an attribute is sometimes obvious, like if the attribute value is measured in milliseconds (units: milliseconds (ms)) or seconds (units: seconds (s)) or a percentage (units: percentage (%)). We also have several units of measurement that are not obvious, like count, enum, rate, and ID. (Technically, these aren't actually \"units of measurement\" and are more just conceptual data types but we're doing it this way as a workaround so you can ignore the fact that units of measurement isn't actually accurate.) The main reason we want to specify this information is that this will control what kinds of queries or charts can be created or auto-suggested by New Relic. For example, the New Relic UI wouldn't want to auto-suggest a chart graphing the average of ID values because that wouldn't make any sense. So attributes with accurate units, such as data types, will help product provide more practical help/suggestions to customers in future. Here are some tips for the non-obvious unit types: count: This is a count of something, though not a count of time-based units. For a number to be a count, it must (a) only be capable of increasing during a given time/sampling period, and (b) have a theoretically uncapped range. This wouldn't be used for a count of time units; if it was a count of seconds, for example, you would just use 'seconds' as the unit of measurement. A couple of examples of a count: databaseCallCount threadConcurrency enum: enum is short for enumerated list. In other words, it is a specific range of numbers that represent other non-numeric elements. For example, an attribute that had HTTP error codes (404, 505, etc.) as possible values would be an enum. A range of numbers that represent color codes would be another example of an enum. (Theoretically, an enum can represent lists without numeric values but we have no need to categorize strings so we only care about numeric-value lists.) Example: httpResponsecode. rate: Use this for any rate (for example, count per second). These are typically for averaged rates over small units of time, like second or millisecond. We previously have used the unit of time for these attributes (for example, using seconds as the unit of measurement for a count per second rate), but now we want to use rate for these. This is necessary because the types of displays used for rates would be different than the types of displays used for a simpler duration/count measurement. Example: MySQL integration attribute db.innodb.dataReadBytesPerSecond, which has the definition \"Rate at which data is read from InnoDB tables in bytes per second.\" id: Use ID for any identification number attribute. Example: appId.",

Each lesson in the course builds upon the last, so make sure you've completed the last lesson, Custom visualizations and the New Relic One SDK, before starting this one. In the previous lesson, you built a custom visualization that shows queried data in one of two chart types: RadarChart Treemap You used a SegmentedControl to switch between the two chart types in the visualization UI. This implementation takes up space in the visualization, but it offers your users the choice to switch between two chart types even after you've created an instance of your chart. But what if you only need to be able to select an option once, when initializing the visualization? In this lesson you'll learn how to add a configuration option to your visualization which replaces the SegmentedControl. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github.

      "body": "Once you've created a chart, you can customize the appearance of it to best present the data. You can share a chart in different formats and add a chart to a new or existing dashboard. Change the appearance of your chart When you run your query in advanced (NRQL) mode or view your chart while using the data explorer to specify data, the query builder analyzes your data and applies a chart type that fits your data. For some queries, you'll have several options of chart types to choose from. To change chart type, use the Chart type menu to the right of the current chart. Each type in the list has a tooltip with information about using that type. Example of the chart type menu, showing a tooltip. Customize your charts While we try our best to optimize how we display your data, sometimes you may have other needs. To this end, you can customize charts to display information at your convenience. Tip Customizations are available depending on the chart type. Format date and time Tip For table and billboard charts. Customize the date and time format for tables and billboards: for each type of data, you can select if you want to leave it as it is, or modify the format as Numeric or Date. If data is a timestamp, you can choose how to represent the date and time: For numbers, select if you want us to auto-format them, or chose the number of decimals you want to see. Customize the Y axis Tip For line and area charts. On line charts and area charts you can adjust the Y axis to display the data within certain values by setting a minimum and maximum value for the axis. If no customization option is selected, dashboards automatically displays the full Y axis from 0 to the top value plus a margin. Enable or disable the legend Tip For line and area charts, and histograms. For line charts, area charts, and histograms, you can disable or enable the legend. Remove the other groups facet Tip For bar and pie charts, and tables. When faceting on bar charts, pie charts, or tables, and if the number of faceting on queries is larger than 2,000, the Other groups facet aggregates the rest of facets. With this customization you can select whether to see Other groups, or remove it. More chart-specific features For more chart type-specific features, see Chart types. Chart share and view options Most charts have various options, including a chart-embed option, getting a chart as an image, and adding a chart to a dashboard. To read about general chart options, see Basic UI features.",

      "body": "Course This lesson is part of a course that teaches you how to build a custom visualization in the New Relic One platform. Use New Relic One custom visualizations to display your data, whether it's from New Relic's database or an external source, in unique ways that are distinct from the charts offered by the New Relic platform. In this lesson, you build a visualization that displays your data in one of two chart types: RadarChart or Treemap. You then implement a SegmentedControl component from the New Relic One SDK, which allows you to alternate between the two chart types. Ultimately, this gives you freedom to view your data in a dynamic way that isn't possible with New Relic's base offerings. Tip If you get lost in the code project and would like to see what the files should look like when you're done with each lesson, check out the course project on Github. Before you begin Explore our custom visualization guides and build your first visualization. After you're done, you'll have a better foundation for building more complex visualizations, such as the one you'll build in this course. Finally, if you haven't already: Sign up for a New Relic account Install Node.js Complete the steps in the nr1 quick start to install and configure the CLI Create your visualization Step 1 of 2 Ensure you're working with the latest version of the New Relic One CLI: bash Copy $ nr1 update Step 2 of 2 Create a visualization, called radar-or-treemap, in a Nerdpack, called alternate-viz: bash Copy $ nr1 create --type visualization --name radar-or-treemap ✔ You’re trying to create a visualization outside of a Nerdpack. We’ll create a Nerdpack for you—what do you want to name it? … alternate-viz ✔ nerdpack created successfully! nerdpack alternate-viz is available at \"./alternate-viz\" ✔ visualization created successfully! visualization radar-or-treemap is available at \"./alternate-viz/visualizations/radar-or-treemap\" Tip If you receive a RequestError for a self-signed certificate when you run nr1 create, you may need to add a certificate to Node's certificate chain. Read more about this and other advanced configurations in Enable advanced configurations for your Nerdpack. As a result, you have a new visualizations/radar-or-treemap directory under alternate-viz: bash Copy $ cd alternate-viz $ ls visualizations/radar-or-treemap index.js nr1.json styles.scss Set up your component state Add component state to the default visualization template that nr1 created for you.

Now that you've created an object which enumerates the chart type options for your visualization, and you've initialized state.selectedChart, you're ready to implement a control UI for switching between the two chart types. Add SegmentedControl components state.selectedChart isn't useful unless your visualization's users can actually select a chart type.

Newcomers who want to get a feel for New Relic’s dashboards and data tools and view real data visualizations in order to make informed decisions about how to add their own data to New Relic. This resource provides information about the Global Performance data sets, how they work, what they do, and current options for accessing Global Performance data. Public API Performance dashboard Important Please note: Global Performance data sets are presented as-is. Global Performance data sets represent an aggregate of samples across a range of sources, and New Relic makes no effort to attempt to confirm the correctness, completeness, or veracity of the data. This data should not be relied on as the sole source of information for any purpose you may use it, and New Relic is not responsible for decisions made in reliance on this data. Global Performance data sets should not be viewed as either an endorsement or a recommendation by New Relic of the technologies represented in the data sets. Access valuable data and try out New Relic Our first Global Performance data set, Public API Performance, offers a large body of real-world, real-time data about the performance of public APIs including AWS, Google, and more as experienced by New Relic customers (as authorized). Because this data is already flowing through New Relic, you can access it within seconds of activating your account, and test drive New Relic dashboarding and querying capabilities in the process.

      "body": "You can filter your New Relic One dashboards by faceted attributes, making your dashboards more interactive and easy to use. Why use facet filtering? In New Relic One dashboards, for NRQL queries containing a FACET clause and meeting other chart-type requirements, you can set up the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or a related, linked dashboard. By letting you quickly filter your dashboards, and link to pre-filtered dashboards, your dashboards are more interactive and easy to use. This feature is available when adding a new chart to a dashboard or when editing a chart on an existing dashboard. To see this feature in action, see the example use case. Requirements Requirements to use this feature: Must be in New Relic One dashboards. Will not work on a standalone chart in the query builder. NRQL query must contain a FACET clause. Available only for bar charts, heat maps, pie charts, and tables. Example use of facet filtering Let's say you create the following facet-containing NRQL query for an existing dashboard in New Relic One: one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: For queries containing a FACET clause and meeting chart-type requirements, you can set those attributes to be used as an easy dashboard filter. You can set the attribute to filter the current dashboard you're on, or filter a related dashboard that you select. If you select Filter the current dashboard, that chart will be used to filter the current dashboard by the available userAgentName attributes. Here's a view of selecting one of those attributes to filter that dashboard. Notice that the chosen attribute appears as a filter in the search bar at the top. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: When you select an attribute you've set up for facet filtering, it filters the current dashboard. For more about this feature, see the Explorers Hub post on facet filtering. Facet linking with the FACET CASES clause FACET CASES is a NRQL function that allows to group facets based on conditions. We support multiple cases in the same facet. Let's say you want to query some data and put the responses into mnemonic categories for a dashboard or report. This syntax will allow you to query based on transaction duration and put the results into two categories: ACCEPTABlE and UNACCEPTABLE. This can be really useful for making dashboards more human readable and actionable. SELECT filter(count(*), WHERE duration > 1) as 'UNACCEPTABLE', filter(count(*), WHERE duration <=1) as 'ACCEPTABLE' FROM Transaction FACET appName LIMIT 5 since 5 minutes ago Copy By using FACET CASES, we can more efficiently use multiple complex conditions to generate a set of custom facets. Building on the previous example, let's say we want to include a compound condition which excludes errors from our duration data and adds them into a third category: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (where duration > 1 and error is NULL as 'UNACCEPTABLE', where duration <= 1 and error is NULL as 'ACCEPTABLE', where error is not NULL as 'ERROR') since 5 minutes ago Copy Then, using facet linking, you can filter your dashboards by those facets.",

      "body": "Access any of your New Relic One dashboards to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data. Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data. Customize your dashboard Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data. Tip Click the icon to access the See metadata and manage tags modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard. Dashboards features include: Edit your dashboard Use the edit button to: Copy the dashboard's permalink. Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name. Create new content by clicking the Add widget button. Add a new chart using the query builder, or add text, images, or links using our markdown editor. Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts. Settings menu Use the settings menu on the upper right corner: To change the name of the dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily. To modify the dashboard's permissions. At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values cannot be modified. TV mode You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen. There are two ways to turn on TV mode: When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the icon at the top right. Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: &platform[tvMode]=true To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the icon. Options include: Dashboard name display. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen. Page cycle. For dashboards with multiple pages, this automatically cycles from page to page. Dark mode High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the icon from the upper right menu bar. Copy your dashboard as JSON You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the < / > icon on the right corner. Export your dashboard You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the icon. Duplicate your dashboard You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the index. The duplicate has Public - Read and write permissions. Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen. The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named This is my dashboard, the duplicate is called This is my dashboard copy. You can change the name when you duplicate it. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time. Tip You can use the search feature at any time to search data across New Relic One. Add new content to your dashboard There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard: From the data explorer and query builder features. Use the + Add to your dashboard button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the query builder, or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our Markdown editor. Copy an existing chart from any dashboard. If you experience issues adding new content, check our error messages. Add custom content using the markdown editor The Markdown editor contains a Markdown pane, where you enter your content, as well as a Preview pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the Commonmark website. You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses icon on any markdown widget and selecting Edit. Organize your dashboards with pages You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions. You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject. For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries. We offer other features to connect dashboards: Create widgets containing markdown text to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards. Use facet filtering to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards. Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names. In New Relic Insights, this feature was called data apps. For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our transition guide. Add and edit pages to a dashboard To add or edit a page in a dashboard: From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the icon. Add a new page: Select Add a page to add a blank page. Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting Duplicate. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other dashboard editing tasks. When finished, select Done editing. Manage your charts and markdown content From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to: Expand your chart to full screen. Share your chart as an image or with a link. Copy the chart to any dashboard. For table charts only, export as a .csv file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis. Create an alert condition. Open the NRQL console to see or edit the query associated to the chart. Duplicate the chart. Delete the chart. Important You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have Read only permissions to the dashboard. Learn more about how to use your charts. Filter and refine your charts You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions: Use the filter bar to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts. Open the advanced filter bar to access the boolean operators (such as =, !=, CONTAINS, EXCLUDES, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data. After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time. To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it. Filter using the chart legend Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze. Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest. Filter dashboards using facets If a chart's NRQL query contains a FACET clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see Filter by facets. Use the time picker to adjust time settings By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were created in the query builder. However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period. The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see Chart refresh intervals. To change the time range: Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from Last 30 minutes to Last 7 days). Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu. Important In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your user preferences, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker. Export and share your data It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond: You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the Export dashboard as PDF button located in the upper right menu bar. You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the Get as image or Get chart link options.",

      "body": "Understanding how high cardinality works is important, because it can impact how quickly you reach your data limits. What is cardinality and why does it matter? Cardinality is generally defined as the number of elements in a set. For dimensional metrics, the set in question is the collection of unique maps of attributes observed for a given metric in a one-day period. You can query the cardinality of a metric in New Relic with the following NRQL format: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(metric.name) SINCE today RAW Copy For example, to query the cardinality of the metric memory.heap and find out how many unique key-value pairs exist for this metric, run the following query: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy Tip We recommend including the RAW clause in cardinality queries that use FROM Metric. This is because in the event your cardinality has been limited, queries like SINCE today will query rollups that are no longer reporting and so need to look at the raw data points to perform the necessary analysis. Note that because querying the raw data points over long time ranges can be slow, RAW queries spanning more than 2 days worth of data are not allowed. While the basics of what cardinality means can be simple to state, learning how to address and manage high cardinality can be a little more complicated. Cardinality limits and enforcement New Relic enforces limits on your metric cardinality both at the per-metric level and at the account level. Cardinality is evaluated over the course of a UTC day, starting at 00:00:00 UTC and ending at 23:59:59 UTC. For more information on data limits and related policies, see New Relic data usage limits and policies Cardinality and dimensional metrics The cardinality of a metric is the size of the set of unique maps of attributes observed for the given metric in a one-day period. If keys or values in that map change over time, they will add new cardinality for that metric. Let's see an example. Imagine a network of 4 hosts, each with 2 containers running on them, and each container periodically reports the gauge metric memory.heap, with the host name and container id added as attributes. When submitted to the Metric API, one of these metrics might look something like this: \"metrics\":[ { \"name\":\"memory.heap\", \"type\":\"gauge\", \"value\":5514, \"timestamp\":1234567890, \"attributes\":{ \"host\":\"W\", \"container\":\"1\" } } ] Copy This metric would then have a cardinality of 8, as that's how many unique mappings of host and container are possible. If a new measurement for this metric is taken with identical attributes as one that had previously reported, no new cardinality would be counted. Cardinality influences As shown above, any changes to the keys or values will represent new cardinality, but predicting how those changes will impact your total cardinality can get a little tricky. It's tempting to assume that the cardinality of a metric is then the product of the number of all possible values for each possible key, but this is rarely the case in practice, as the values a given key often depend on or determine the values of other keys. Using the previous example, once we had a container value of 1, the value of host was fixed to W, assuming those container IDs are globally unique. So while there are 8 containers across 4 hosts, the cardinality is still 8, not 4 * 8 = 32, since most combinations counted by the simple multiplication method are not possible and therefore don't contribute to that metric's cardinality. We will never see the combination of host = 'X', container = 1, for instance. This also means that adding more keys to an attributes map does not necessarily imply an increase to total cardinality. If the value of the new key is uniquely determined by the values of existing keys, it will not add new cardinality in the long term. For instance if you add something like region to your map in the example, it's likely the case that the container value is also fixed to a particular region value, and therefore keeps your cardinality at 8. An important caveat here is that while adding region won't increase the cardinality going forward, it will introduce new cardinality when it is first added. This is because adding keys will make those attribute maps distinct from any that came before them, temporarily increasing the total cardinality for that day. Examples and sample workflows If you hit one of your cardinality limits, there are a couple of options you can use to remedy the situation. One easy answer is increasing your limits, but if you would prefer not to do that, a good alternative is to explore which dimensions are contributing the most to your cardinality and think about removing them if they do not provide value. This can save storage and bandwidth costs and potentially prevent you needing to raise your limits. Find cardinality contributors: metrics Recall how to get the cardinality of a particular metric: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy For the total account cardinality, you can use the same basic query structure and simply omit the metric name: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW Copy The account's cardinality is essentially the sum of each metric's cardinality, so adding in a simple FACET query can help find the highest cardinality metrics: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW FACET metricName Copy Finally, if you believe you have hit one of your cardinality limits, you can confirm this by checking for a related NrIntegrationError: FROM NrIntegrationError SELECT count(*) where name = 'CardinalityViolationException' and newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' facet cardinalityLimitType, metricName, message since today Copy Finding cardinality contributors: dimensions Once you've determined a metric you want to explore, the next step is to determine which dimensions in a given metric contribute the most to its cardinality. If you are unfamiliar with the values of your dimensions, you can look at them like so: FROM Metric SELECT dimensions() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy The JSON results view will likely be advisable here. Looking through these could reveal some dimensions containing a unique ID or other highly variable value that might be worth removing. If you are already familiar with what values your attributes can take on, the keySet() results may be easier to scan: FROM Metric SELECT keySet() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy Understanding the dimensions that have the most influence on your total cardinality comes down to understanding how each key's values correlate with one another. You can experiment with what your cardinality would be without a dimension simply by adding it to the exclude list: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, exclude: {'container.id'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Likewise, there is an include list if that is more convenient to the query context: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, include: {'host.name', 'region'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Managing cardinality can be tricky to conceptualize, but the above methods will help you get answers to questions like \"What metric is contributing the most cardinality?\" and \"What impact does a given attribute(s) have to that total cardinality?\". It's often the case that cardinality tracks with the most unique value, as that value may pin down the possible values other attributes can take on. However, there are plenty of cases where the explosion of possible combinations of a handful of attributes drives the total cardinality. Things that look like unique identifiers are generally a good place to start, but sometimes it's no single key but the combination of two or more keys. The more familiar you are with your data and the systems that generate it, the easier it will be to know which attributes to include or exclude.

      "body": "NRQL is a query language you can use to query the New Relic database. This document explains NRQL syntax, clauses, components, and functions. Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute, and you can use the OR operator to facet results that don't match any of your specified cases. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy Facet non-matching data with OR This example uses the OR operator to facet results that didn't match any of your cases: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') OR name Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE r'z.*|q.*'' hostname RLIKE r'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' z-app q-app ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions In this section we explain NRQL functions, both aggregator functions and non-aggregator functions. Aggregator functions You can use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data. Some tips for using these: See New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. If you're using an aggregator function multiple times in the same query (e.g., SELECT median(one_metric</var>), median(another_metric)), it can cause problems in displaying results. To solve this, use the AS function. For example: SELECT median(one_metric) as 'med-a', median(another_metric) as 'med-b' Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. For how to display results over time, see Group results over time. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in the same unit of time as the chosen attribute. For instance, if the attribute is measured in seconds, t will be a threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy capture(attribute, regular expression) Use the capture() to extract values from an attribute using a regular expression. Uses RE2 syntax. It takes two arguments: Attribute name Regular expression with capture syntax. Regex expressions in NRQL use Python-like syntax, r'...'. When capturing, use the RE2 named-capture syntax ...(?P<name> pattern )... to capture the contained pattern, given the specified name. Currently, only 1 capture group is supported. Please see the examples below. capture() within a SELECT clause condition The following will select the domain name of the website, removing https:// and any paths following the .com SELECT capture(pageUrl, r'https://(?P<baseUrl>.*.com)/.+') FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The following will capture only the first word of the error message. SELECT capture(errorMessage, r'(?P<firstWord>\\S+)\\s.+') FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago where errorMessage is not null Copy capture() within a FACET clause condition The following will facet by the captured HTTP method. SELECT count(*) FROM Log WHERE message like '%HTTP%' FACET capture(message, r'.* \"(?P<httpMethod>[A-Z]+) .*') Copy capture() within a WHERE clause condition The following will filter the results based on Log events with message attribute that matches the regular expression where the captured job name is ExampleJob. SELECT message FROM Log WHERE capture(message, r'.*Job Failed: (?P<jobName>[A-Za-z]+),.*') = 'ExampleJob' SINCE 10 minutes ago Copy capture() with a numeric cast The following will capture sum of CPU Time from log lines. You must explicitly cast to numeric to do mathematical operations. SELECT sum(numeric(capture(message, r'.*CpuTime:\\s(?P<cpuTime>\\d+)'))) FROM Log WHERE message like '%CpuTime:%' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "Understanding how high cardinality works is important, because it can impact how quickly you reach your data limits. What is cardinality and why does it matter? Cardinality is generally defined as the number of elements in a set. For dimensional metrics, the set in question is the collection of unique maps of attributes observed for a given metric in a one-day period. You can query the cardinality of a metric in New Relic with the following NRQL format: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(metric.name) SINCE today RAW Copy For example, to query the cardinality of the metric memory.heap and find out how many unique key-value pairs exist for this metric, run the following query: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy Tip We recommend including the RAW clause in cardinality queries that use FROM Metric. This is because in the event your cardinality has been limited, queries like SINCE today will query rollups that are no longer reporting and so need to look at the raw data points to perform the necessary analysis. Note that because querying the raw data points over long time ranges can be slow, RAW queries spanning more than 2 days worth of data are not allowed. While the basics of what cardinality means can be simple to state, learning how to address and manage high cardinality can be a little more complicated. Cardinality limits and enforcement New Relic enforces limits on your metric cardinality both at the per-metric level and at the account level. Cardinality is evaluated over the course of a UTC day, starting at 00:00:00 UTC and ending at 23:59:59 UTC. For more information on data limits and related policies, see New Relic data usage limits and policies Cardinality and dimensional metrics The cardinality of a metric is the size of the set of unique maps of attributes observed for the given metric in a one-day period. If keys or values in that map change over time, they will add new cardinality for that metric. Let's see an example. Imagine a network of 4 hosts, each with 2 containers running on them, and each container periodically reports the gauge metric memory.heap, with the host name and container id added as attributes. When submitted to the Metric API, one of these metrics might look something like this: \"metrics\":[ { \"name\":\"memory.heap\", \"type\":\"gauge\", \"value\":5514, \"timestamp\":1234567890, \"attributes\":{ \"host\":\"W\", \"container\":\"1\" } } ] Copy This metric would then have a cardinality of 8, as that's how many unique mappings of host and container are possible. If a new measurement for this metric is taken with identical attributes as one that had previously reported, no new cardinality would be counted. Cardinality influences As shown above, any changes to the keys or values will represent new cardinality, but predicting how those changes will impact your total cardinality can get a little tricky. It's tempting to assume that the cardinality of a metric is then the product of the number of all possible values for each possible key, but this is rarely the case in practice, as the values a given key often depend on or determine the values of other keys. Using the previous example, once we had a container value of 1, the value of host was fixed to W, assuming those container IDs are globally unique. So while there are 8 containers across 4 hosts, the cardinality is still 8, not 4 * 8 = 32, since most combinations counted by the simple multiplication method are not possible and therefore don't contribute to that metric's cardinality. We will never see the combination of host = 'X', container = 1, for instance. This also means that adding more keys to an attributes map does not necessarily imply an increase to total cardinality. If the value of the new key is uniquely determined by the values of existing keys, it will not add new cardinality in the long term. For instance if you add something like region to your map in the example, it's likely the case that the container value is also fixed to a particular region value, and therefore keeps your cardinality at 8. An important caveat here is that while adding region won't increase the cardinality going forward, it will introduce new cardinality when it is first added. This is because adding keys will make those attribute maps distinct from any that came before them, temporarily increasing the total cardinality for that day. Examples and sample workflows If you hit one of your cardinality limits, there are a couple of options you can use to remedy the situation. One easy answer is increasing your limits, but if you would prefer not to do that, a good alternative is to explore which dimensions are contributing the most to your cardinality and think about removing them if they do not provide value. This can save storage and bandwidth costs and potentially prevent you needing to raise your limits. Find cardinality contributors: metrics Recall how to get the cardinality of a particular metric: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy For the total account cardinality, you can use the same basic query structure and simply omit the metric name: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW Copy The account's cardinality is essentially the sum of each metric's cardinality, so adding in a simple FACET query can help find the highest cardinality metrics: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW FACET metricName Copy Finally, if you believe you have hit one of your cardinality limits, you can confirm this by checking for a related NrIntegrationError: FROM NrIntegrationError SELECT count(*) where name = 'CardinalityViolationException' and newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' facet cardinalityLimitType, metricName, message since today Copy Finding cardinality contributors: dimensions Once you've determined a metric you want to explore, the next step is to determine which dimensions in a given metric contribute the most to its cardinality. If you are unfamiliar with the values of your dimensions, you can look at them like so: FROM Metric SELECT dimensions() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy The JSON results view will likely be advisable here. Looking through these could reveal some dimensions containing a unique ID or other highly variable value that might be worth removing. If you are already familiar with what values your attributes can take on, the keySet() results may be easier to scan: FROM Metric SELECT keySet() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy Understanding the dimensions that have the most influence on your total cardinality comes down to understanding how each key's values correlate with one another. You can experiment with what your cardinality would be without a dimension simply by adding it to the exclude list: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, exclude: {'container.id'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Likewise, there is an include list if that is more convenient to the query context: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, include: {'host.name', 'region'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Managing cardinality can be tricky to conceptualize, but the above methods will help you get answers to questions like \"What metric is contributing the most cardinality?\" and \"What impact does a given attribute(s) have to that total cardinality?\". It's often the case that cardinality tracks with the most unique value, as that value may pin down the possible values other attributes can take on. However, there are plenty of cases where the explosion of possible combinations of a handful of attributes drives the total cardinality. Things that look like unique identifiers are generally a good place to start, but sometimes it's no single key but the combination of two or more keys. The more familiar you are with your data and the systems that generate it, the easier it will be to know which attributes to include or exclude. Tip If you'd like to learn more about limits and troubleshooting the Metric API, here are two good resources: Metric API limits and restricted attributes Troubleshoot Metric API with NRIntegrationError events are both great resources to explore.",

Syntax This document is a reference for the functions and clauses used in a NRQL query. Other resources for understanding NRQL: Intro to NRQL: explains what NRQL is used for, what data you can query with it, and basic NRQL syntax Examine NRQL queries used to build New Relic charts Learn how to query the Metric data type Use funnels to evaluate a series of related data Format NRQL for querying with the Event API Query components Every NRQL query will begin with a SELECT statement or a FROM clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries. Required clauses Required: SELECT statement SELECT attribute ... Copy SELECT function(attribute) ... Copy The SELECT specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an attribute or a function. It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can: Get the values of all available attributes by using * as a wildcard. For example: SELECT * from Transaction. Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a comma separated list. Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an aggregator function. Label the results returned in each argument with the AS clause. You can also use SELECT with basic math functions. Avg response time since last week This query returns the average response time since last week. SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Required: FROM clause SELECT ... FROM data type ... Copy Use the FROM clause to specify the data type you wish to query. You can start your query with FROM or with SELECT. You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a comma separated list. Query one data type This query returns the count of all APM transactions over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query multiple data types This query returns the count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Optional clauses AS clause SELECT ... AS 'label' ... Copy Use the AS clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart. Query using math function and AS This query returns the number of page views per session: SELECT count(*)/uniqueCount(session) AS 'Pageviews per Session' FROM PageView Copy Query using funnel and AS This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week: SELECT funnel(SESSION, WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1', WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2') FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy COMPARE WITH clause SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO ... Copy Use the COMPARE WITH clause to compare the values for two different time ranges. COMPARE WITH requires a SINCE or UNTIL statement. The time specified by COMPARE WITH is relative to the time specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago compares yesterday with the day before. The time range for theCOMPARE WITH value is always the same as that specified by SINCE or UNTIL. For example, SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm. COMPARE WITH can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard: With TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time. Without TIMESERIES, COMPARE WITH generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the COMPARE WITH value. Example: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past hour compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart. SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO SELECT percentile(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy EXTRAPOLATE clause You can use this clause with these data types: Transaction TransactionError Custom events reported via APM agent APIs The purpose of EXTRAPOLATE is to mathematically compensate for the effects of APM agent sampling of event data so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system. This clause will be useful when a APM agent reports so many events that it often passes its harvest cycle reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events. When EXTRAPOLATE is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the reported events and the total events is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect. Important Note that EXTRAPOLATE is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like uniqueCount() or uniques()). This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following aggregator functions: apdex average count histogram sum percentage (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) rate (if function it takes as an argument supports EXTRAPOLATE) stddev Example of extrapolating throughput A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago EXTRAPOLATE Copy Example of extrapolating throughput as a time series A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named interestingApplication by transaction name, displayed as a time series. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction WHERE appName='interestingApplication' SINCE 60 minutes ago FACET name TIMESERIES 1 minute EXTRAPOLATE Copy FACET clause SELECT ... FACET attribute ... Copy Use FACET to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could FACET your PageView data by deviceType to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Use the LIMIT clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use FACET CASES. FACET clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas. The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the SELECT clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type. When selecting min(), max(), or count(), FACET uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other function, FACET uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted. Faceted query using count() This query shows cities with the highest pageview counts. This query uses the total number of pageviews per city to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Faceted query using uniqueCount() This query shows the cities that access the highest number of unique URLs. This query uses the total number of times a particular city appears in the results to determine how facets are picked and ordered. SELECT uniqueCount(pageUrl) FROM PageView FACET city Copy Grouping results across time Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data. Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times. FACET ... AS clause Use FACET ... AS to name facets using the AS keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in nested aggregation queries. FACET ... AS queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves. FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type' Copy FACET CASES clause SELECT ... FACET CASES ( WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ... ) ... Copy Use FACET CASES to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with FACET. Separate multiple conditions with a comma ,. For example, you could query your PageView data and FACET CASES into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the AS selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match. You may also use a time function with your attribute, and you can use the OR operator to facet results that don't match any of your specified cases. Basic usage with WHERE SELECT count(*) FROM PageView FACET CASES (WHERE duration < 1, WHERE duration > 1 and duration < 10, WHERE duration > 10) Copy Group based on multiple attributes This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains login, and another where the URL contains login and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') Copy Label groups with AS This example uses the AS selector to give your results a human-readable name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%' AS 'Total Logins', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid' AS 'Feature Visits from Paid Users') Copy Facet non-matching data with OR This example uses the OR operator to facet results that didn't match any of your cases: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') OR name Copy FACET ... ORDER BY clause In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the SELECT clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. FACET ... ORDER BY allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the LIMIT clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming. This example shows how to use FACET ... ORDER BY to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if FACET ... ORDER BY is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize) Copy Tip Because the operations are performed before the LIMIT clause is applied, FACET ... ORDER BY does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries. Important The ORDER BY modifier in this case works differently than the ORDER BY clause. When parsing queries that follow the format FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2, New Relic will read these as FACET ... ORDER BY queries, but only if ORDER BY appears immediately after FACET. Otherwise ORDER BY will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause. LIMIT clause SELECT ... LIMIT count ... Copy Use the LIMIT clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by FACET queries or the maximum number of items returned by SELECT * queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the LIMIT clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for FACET queries and 100 in the case of SELECT * queries. The maximum allowed value for the LIMIT clause is 2,000. Query using LIMIT This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only. SELECT uniqueCount(session), percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Windows' FACET countryCode LIMIT 20 SINCE YESTERDAY Copy OFFSET clause SELECT ... LIMIT count OFFSET count ... Copy Use the OFFSET clause with LIMIT to control the portion of rows returned by SELECT * or SELECT column queries. Like the LIMIT clause, OFFSET takes a single integer value as an argument. OFFSET sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by LIMIT. OFFSET rows are skipped starting from the most recent record. For example, the query SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1 returns the last 5 values from Minute_Report except for the most recent one. ORDER BY clause The ORDER BY clause allows you to specify how you want to sort your query results in queries that select event attributes by row. This query orders transactions by duration. FROM Transaction SELECT appName, duration ORDER BY duration Copy The default sort order is ascending, but this can be changed by adding the ASC or DESC modifiers. SHOW EVENT TYPES clause SHOW EVENT TYPES... Copy SHOW EVENT TYPES will return a list of all the data types present in your account for a specific time range. It is used as the first clause in a query instead of SELECT. Important In this context, \"event types\" refers to the data types you can access with a NRQL query. Data types in the last day This query will return all the data types present over the past day: SHOW EVENT TYPES SINCE 1 day ago Copy SINCE clause SELECT ... SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase] ... Copy The default value is 1 hour ago. Use the SINCE clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or relative time range. You can specify a timezone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time. SLIDE BY clause The SLIDE BY clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,SLIDE BY data is gathered into \"windows\" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time. To use SLIDE BY, place it in a query after the TIMESERIES clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute SLIDE BY interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute Copy To learn more about how and when you can use SLIDE BY, see Create smoother charts with sliding windows. Use SLIDE BY with MAX or AUTO interval You can use sliding windows in combination with MAX or AUTO. However, MAX or AUTO may not be placed between TIMESERIES and SLIDE BY. This query will automatically decide a SLIDE BY window interval. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO Copy This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX Copy Important The SLIDE BY value as determined by AUTO or MAX can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results. TIMESERIES clause SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer units ... Copy Use the TIMESERIES clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since TIMESERIES is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value. To indicate the time range, use integer units. For example: TIMESERIES 1 minute TIMESERIES 30 minutes TIMESERIES 1 hour TIMESERIES 30 seconds TIMESERIES can be combined with arguments such as MAX, AUTO, and SLIDE BY to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below. Important For functions such as average( ) or percentile( ), a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows. Use a set interval The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments: SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes Copy Use an automatically set interval TIMESERIES can also be set to AUTO, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals. This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours. SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO Copy Use MAX interval You can set TIMESERIES to MAX, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your TIMESERIES buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of TIMESERIES buckets that will be returned is 366. For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart. SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX Copy UNTIL clause SELECT ... UNTIL integer units AGO ... Copy The default value is NOW. Only use UNTIL to specify an end point other than the default. Use the UNTIL clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended. See Use the time picker to adjust time settings for detailed information and examples. WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause. SELECT function(attribute) ... WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value]) | IS [NOT] NULL ] [AND|OR ...] ... Copy If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators AND or OR. If you want to simulate a SQL join, use custom attributes in a WHERE or FACET clause. Operators that the WHERE clause accepts Description =, !=, <, <=, >, >= NRQL accepts standard comparison operators. Example: state = 'WA' AND Used to define an intersection of two conditions. OR Used to define a union of two conditions. IS NULL Determines if an attribute has a null value. IS NOT NULL Determines if an attribute does not have a null value. IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Example: animalType IN ('cat', 'dog', 'fish') NOT IN Determines if the string value of an attribute is not in a specified set. Using this method yields better performance than stringing together multiple WHERE clauses. Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example: SELECT * FROM PageView WHERE countryCode NOT IN ('CA', 'WA') Copy LIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string. The string argument for the LIKE operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string. Examples: userAgentName LIKE 'IE%' IE IE Mobile userAgentName LIKE 'o%a%' Opera Opera Mini userAgentName LIKE 'o%a' Opera userAgentName LIKE '%o%a%' Opera Opera Mini Mozilla Gecko NOT LIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified sub-string. RLIKE Determines if an attribute contains a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Examples: appName RLIKE r'z.*|q.*'' hostname RLIKE r'ip-10-351-[0-2]?[0-9]-.*' z-app q-app ip-10-351-19-237 ip-10-351-2-41 ip-10-351-24-238 ip-10-351-14-15 Important Regex defaults to full-string matching, therefore ^ and $ are implicit and you do not need to add them. NOT RLIKE Determines if an attribute does not contain a specified Regex sub-string. Uses RE2 syntax. Example query with three conditions This query returns the browser response time for pages with checkout in the URL for Safari users in the United States and Canada over the past 24 hours. SELECT histogram(duration, 50, 20) FROM PageView WHERE countryCode IN ('CA', 'US') AND userAgentName='Safari' AND pageUrl LIKE '%checkout%' SINCE 1 day ago Copy WITH METRIC_FORMAT clause For information on querying metric data, see Query metrics. WITH TIMEZONE clause SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone) ... Copy By default, query results are displayed in the timezone of the browser you're using. Use the WITH TIMEZONE clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it. For example, the query clause SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York' will return data recorded from Monday at midnight, Eastern Standard Time, until midnight Tuesday, Eastern Standard Time.

Query metric data Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines: Query dimensional metrics, which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our tools that use that API, like our Telemetry SDKs and our open-source telemetry integrations (OpenTelemetry, Kamon, Micrometer, more). Query metric timeslice data, which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring. For more on understanding these data types, see Metric data types. Functions In this section we explain NRQL functions, both aggregator functions and non-aggregator functions. Aggregator functions You can use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data. Some tips for using these: See New Relic University tutorials for Filter queries, Apdex queries, and Percentile queries. Or, go to the full online course Writing NRQL queries. If you're using an aggregator function multiple times in the same query (e.g., SELECT median(one_metric</var>), median(another_metric)), it can cause problems in displaying results. To solve this, use the AS function. For example: SELECT median(one_metric) as 'med-a', median(another_metric) as 'med-b' Data type \"coercion\" is not supported. Read about available type conversion functions. For how to display results over time, see Group results over time. Examples: SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy aggregationendtime() Use the aggregationendtime() function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the aggregationendtime() function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period. apdex(attribute, t: ) Use the apdex function to return an Apdex score for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The attribute can be any attribute based on response time, such as duration or backendDuration. The t: argument defines an Apdex T threshold in the same unit of time as the chosen attribute. For instance, if the attribute is measured in seconds, t will be a threshold in seconds. The Apdex score returned by the apdex( ) function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in Apdex T or less, that transaction will be rated satisfying by the apdex ( ) function. Get Apdex for specific customers If you have defined custom attributes, you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago Copy Get Apdex for specific transaction Use the name attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting name. This query returns an Apdex score for the Controller/notes/index transaction over the last hour: The apdex function returns an Apdex score that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds. SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Get overall Apdex for your app This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks: SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago Copy average(attribute) Use the average( ) function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the buckets() function to aggregate data split up by a FACET clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket. Total number of buckets For more information and examples, see Split your data into buckets. bucketPercentile(attribute) The bucketPercentile( ) function is the NRQL equivalent of the histogram_quantile function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile * 100. Use the bucketPercentile( ) function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format. It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument: SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago Copy Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated <basename>. For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the <basename> prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds using NRQL, use bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50). Note how _ bucket is added to the end of the <basename> as a suffix. See the Prometheus.io documentation for more information. cardinality(attribute) Use the cardinality( ) function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a metric. It takes three arguments, all optional: Metric name: if present, cardinality( ) only computes the metric specified. Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation. SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list}) Copy count(*) Use the count( ) function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either *, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument. Since count(*) does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default \"humanize\" format. derivative(attribute [,time interval]) derivative() finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a null value. The time interval is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, derivative(attributeName, 1 minute) will return the rate of change per minute. dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes}) Use the dimensions( ) function to return all the dimensional values on a data type. You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments: Include: if present, the include list limits dimensions( ) to those attributes. Exclude: if present, the dimensions( ) calculation ignores those attributes. FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions() Copy When used with a FACET clause, dimensions( ) produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries. latestrate(attribute, time interval) Use the latestrate( ) function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of change in attribute/time interval. This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends. Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of duration/second because of the 1 SECOND argument. SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView Copy max(attribute) Use the max( ) function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. median(attribute) Use the median( ) function to return an attribute's median, or 50th percentile. For more information about percentile queries, see percentile(). Tip The median( ) query is only available when using the query builder. Median query This query will generate a line chart for the median value. SELECT median(duration) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy min(attribute) Use the min( ) function to return the minimum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null. minuteOf(attribute) Use the minuteOf() function to extract only the minute portion (i.e. 0-59) of an attribute holding a valid timestamp value. mod(attribute, divisor) Use the mod( ) function to return the floor modulus after dividing the value of the provided numeric attribute (the first argument, or dividend) by a numeric value (the second argument, or divisor). This modulo operation can be used within a WHERE clause condition to filter to an arbitrary subset of results or within a FACET clause as a way to subdivide the result set. mod() within a WHERE clause condition FROM Transaction SELECT * WHERE mod(port, 2) = 1 Copy mod() within a FACET clause FROM NrDailyUsage SELECT uniques(hostId, 10000) SINCE 1 day AGO FACET mod(hostId, 10) Copy percentage(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the percentage( ) function to return the percentage of a target data set that matches some condition. The first argument requires an aggregator function against the desired attribute. Use exactly two arguments (arguments after the first two will be ignored). If the attribute is not numeric, this function returns a value of 100%. percentile(attribute [, percentile [, ...]]) Use the percentile( ) function to return an attribute's approximate value at a given percentile. It requires an attribute and can take any number of arguments representing percentile points. The percentile() function enables percentiles to displays with up to three digits after the decimal point, providing greater precision. Percentile thresholds may be specified as decimal values, but be aware that for most data sets, percentiles closer than 0.1 from each other will not be resolved. Percentile display examples Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with percentiles mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard and attribute sheet showing aggregate values for the percentiles. If no percentiles are listed, the default is the 95th percentile. To return only the 50th percentile value, the median, you can also use median(). Basic percentile query This query will generate a line chart with lines for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile. SELECT percentile(duration, 5, 50, 95) FROM PageView TIMESERIES AUTO Copy predictLinear(attribute, [,time interval]) predictLinear() is an extension of the derivative() function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset. The time interval is how far the query will look into the future. For example, predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour) is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window. Generally, predictLinear() is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends. Since predictLinear() is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions. Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions. New Relic recommends against using predictLinear in TIMESERIES queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward. rate(function(attribute) [,time interval]) Use the rate( ) function to visualize the frequency or rate of a given query per time interval. For example, you might want to know the number of pageviews per minute over an hour-long period or the count of unique sessions on your site per hour over a day-long period. Use TIMESERIES to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time. Omit TIMESERIES to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time. Basic rate query This query will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours. SELECT rate(count(*), 10 minute) FROM Transaction SINCE 6 hours ago TIMESERIES Copy round(attribute) Use the round( ) function to return the rounded value of an attribute. Optionally round( ) can take a second argument, to_nearest, to round the first argument to the closest multiple of the second one. to_nearest can be fractional. SELECT round(n [, to_nearest]) Copy stddev(attribute) Use the stddev( ) function to return one standard deviation for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. stdvar(attribute) Use the stdvar( ) function to return the standard variance for a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. sum(attribute) Use the sum( ) function to return the sum recorded values of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If the attribute is not numeric, it will return a value of zero. uniqueCount(attribute) Use the uniqueCount( ) function to return the number of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. Tip To optimize query performance, this function returns approximate results for queries that inspect more than 256 unique values. uniques(attribute [,limit]) Use the uniques( ) function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the facet clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value. The limit parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different limit value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The uniques( ) function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency. The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the uniques( ) limit times the facet limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000). Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed. From Transaction SELECT uniques(host,5000) FACET appName LIMIT 1000 Copy Using tuple If you'd like to know the unique combinations of a handful of attributes, you can structure a query in the format SELECT uniques(tuple(x, y, ... z)) ...` to get all the unique tuples of values, to maintain their relationship. In the following query, tuple is used on index and cellName together to find uniques where those two values occur in combination. FROM NodeStatus SELECT uniques(tuple(index, cellName), 5) Copy capture(attribute, regular expression) Use the capture() to extract values from an attribute using a regular expression. Uses RE2 syntax. It takes two arguments: Attribute name Regular expression with capture syntax. Regex expressions in NRQL use Python-like syntax, r'...'. When capturing, use the RE2 named-capture syntax ...(?P<name> pattern )... to capture the contained pattern, given the specified name. Currently, only 1 capture group is supported. Please see the examples below. capture() within a SELECT clause condition The following will select the domain name of the website, removing https:// and any paths following the .com SELECT capture(pageUrl, r'https://(?P<baseUrl>.*.com)/.+') FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy The following will capture only the first word of the error message. SELECT capture(errorMessage, r'(?P<firstWord>\\S+)\\s.+') FROM Transaction SINCE 1 hour ago where errorMessage is not null Copy capture() within a FACET clause condition The following will facet by the captured HTTP method. SELECT count(*) FROM Log WHERE message like '%HTTP%' FACET capture(message, r'.* \"(?P<httpMethod>[A-Z]+) .*') Copy capture() within a WHERE clause condition The following will filter the results based on Log events with message attribute that matches the regular expression where the captured job name is ExampleJob. SELECT message FROM Log WHERE capture(message, r'.*Job Failed: (?P<jobName>[A-Za-z]+),.*') = 'ExampleJob' SINCE 10 minutes ago Copy capture() with a numeric cast The following will capture sum of CPU Time from log lines. You must explicitly cast to numeric to do mathematical operations. SELECT sum(numeric(capture(message, r'.*CpuTime:\\s(?P<cpuTime>\\d+)'))) FROM Log WHERE message like '%CpuTime:%' SINCE 1 hour ago Copy Non-aggregator functions Use non-aggregator functions for non-numerical data in NRQL queries. earliest(attribute) Use the earliest( ) function to return the earliest value for an attribute over the specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get earliest country per user agent from PageView This query returns the earliest country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT earliest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy eventType() ...WHERE eventType() = 'EventNameHere'... ...FACET eventType()... Copy Use the eventType() function in a FACET clause to break out results by the selected data type or in a WHERE clause to filter results to a specific data type. This is particularly useful for targeting specific data types with the filter() and percentage() functions. Important In this context, \"event type\" refers to the types of data you can access with a NRQL query. Use eventType() in filter() function This query returns the percentage of total TransactionError results out of the total Transaction results. You can use the eventType() function to target specific types of data with the filter() function. SELECT 100 * filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'TransactionError') / filter(count(*), where eventType() = 'Transaction') FROM Transaction, TransactionError WHERE appName = 'App.Prod' TIMESERIES 2 Minutes SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Use eventType() with FACET This query displays a count of how many records each data type (Transaction and TransactionError) returns. SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, TransactionError FACET eventType() TIMESERIES Copy filter(function(attribute), WHERE condition) Use the filter() function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. You can use filter() in conjunction with FACET or TIMESERIES. Filter is only useful when selecting multiple different aggregations such as SELECT filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='a') AS 'A', filter(sum(x), WHERE attribute='b') AS 'B' .... Otherwise, it's better to just use the standard WHERE clause. Analyze purchases that used offer codes You could use filter() to compare the items bought in a set of transactions for those using an offer code versus those who aren't: Use the filter( ) function to limit the results for one of the aggregator functions in your SELECT statement. funnel(attribute, steps) Use the funnel() function to generate a funnel chart. It takes an attribute as its first argument. You then specify steps as WHERE clauses (with optional AS clauses for labels) separated by commas. For details and examples, see the funnels documentation. getField(attribute, field) Use the getField() function to extract a field from compound data types, such as metric data. It takes the following arguments: Metric type Supported fields summary count, total, max, min, type gauge count, total, max, min, latest, type distribution count, total, max, min, type counter count, type timeslice count, total, totalExclusive, min, and max Examples: SELECT max(getField(mySummary, count)) from Metric Copy SELECT sum(mySummary) from Metric where getField(mySummary, count) > 10 Copy histogram(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets]) Use the histogram( ) function to generate histograms. It takes three arguments: Attribute name Maximum value of the sample range Total number of buckets (between 1 and 500, inclusive) Histogram of response times from PageView events This query results in a histogram of response times ranging up to 10 seconds over 20 buckets. SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy Prometheus histogram buckets histogram( ) accepts Prometheus histogram buckets: SELECT histogram(duration_bucket, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy New Relic distribution metric histogram( ) accepts Distribution metric as an input: SELECT histogram(myDistributionMetric, 10, 20) FROM Metric SINCE 1 week ago Copy Histogram with a FACET clause Use histogram( ) with a FACET clause to generate a heatmap chart: SELECT histogram(duration) FROM PageView FACET appName SINCE 1 week ago Copy keyset() Using keyset() will allow you to see all of the attributes for a given data type over a given time range. It takes no arguments. It returns a JSON structure containing groups of string-typed keys, numeric-typed keys, boolean-typed keys, and all keys. See all attributes for a data type This query returns the attributes found for PageView events from the last day: SELECT keyset() FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago Copy latest(attribute) Use the latest( ) function to return the most recent value for an attribute over a specified time range. It takes a single argument. Arguments after the first will be ignored. If used in conjunction with a FACET it will return the most recent value for an attribute for each of the resulting facets. Get most recent country per user agent from PageView This query returns the most recent country code per each user agent from the PageView event. SELECT latest(countryCode) FROM PageView FACET userAgentName Copy Type conversion NRQL does not support \"coercion.\" This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values. You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean types with these functions: Use the numeric() function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric function. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as average(). Use the boolean() function to convert a string value of \"true\" or \"false\" to the corresponding boolean value.",

      "body": "One way to query your New Relic data is with the New Relic Query Language (NRQL). This resource explains what NRQL is, when and how you can use it, and basic syntax rules. For more detailed information on querying, including a listing of clauses and functions and example queries, see NRQL syntax, clauses, and functions. What is NRQL? NRQL is New Relic's SQL-like query language. You can use NRQL to retrieve detailed New Relic data and get insight into your applications, hosts, and business-important activity. Reasons to use NRQL include: To answer a question for the purpose of troubleshooting or business analysis To create a new chart To make API queries of New Relic data (for example, using our NerdGraph API) NRQL is used behind the scenes to generate some New Relic charts: Some New Relic charts are built using NRQL. One way to start using NRQL is to view a chart's query and then edit it to make your own custom chart. Where can you use NRQL? You can use NRQL in these places: New Relic One query builder NerdGraph: our GraphQL-format API, which includes options for making NRQL queries one.newrelic.com > Query your data: You can run a NRQL query in New Relic One. This NRQL query shows a count of distributed tracing spans faceted by their entity names. NRQL is one of several ways to query New Relic data. For more on all query options, see Query your data. What data can you query with NRQL? NRQL allows you to query these New Relic data types: Event data from all New Relic products, including: APM events, like Transaction Browser monitoring events, like PageView Mobile monitoring events, like Mobile Infrastructure events, like ProcessSample Synthetics events, like SyntheticCheck Custom events, like those reported by the Event API Metric timeslice data (metrics reported by APM, browser, and mobile) The Metric data type (metrics reported by the Metric API and data sources that use that API) The Span data type (distributed tracing data) The Log data type (data from New Relic Logs) Tip Some data, like relationships between monitored entities, is not available via NRQL but is available using our NerdGraph API. Start using NRQL One way to start using NRQL and to understand what data you have available is to go to a NRQL interface (for example, the New Relic One query builder), type FROM, and press space. The interface will suggest available types of data: To see the attributes available for a specific data type, type FROM DATA_TYPE SELECT and press space. The interface will suggest available attributes. For example: To see the complete JSON associated with a data type, including all of its attributes, use the keyset() attribute. For example: FROM Transaction SELECT keyset() Copy NRQL is used behind the scenes to build some New Relic charts and dashboards. One way to learn NRQL is to find one of these NRQL-generated charts and start playing with the NRQL to create new, customized queries and charts: Charts built with NRQL will have View query as an option. You can then edit and customize that query to see how your changes affect the resulting visualization. Important To explore your data without having to use NRQL, use the data explorer. Learn more about querying data in New Relic. NRQL query examples Here's an example NRQL query of Transaction data, which is reported by APM. FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) FACET appName TIMESERIES auto Copy This would generate a chart that looks like: Here are some more query examples: Basic NRQL query of browser data Here's a NRQL query of PageView data from browser monitoring. SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView WHERE userAgentOS = 'Mac' FACET countryCode SINCE 1 day ago LIMIT 20 Copy Attribute name with a space in it If a custom attribute name has a space in it, use backticks around the attribute name: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Querying multiple data sources To return data from two data sources, separate their data types with a comma. For example, this query returns a count of all APM transactions and browser events over the last three days: SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago Copy Query returning multiple columns To return multiple columns from a dataset, separate the aggregator arguments with a comma: SELECT function(attribute), function(attribute) ... FROM ... Copy This query returns the minimum, average, and maximum duration for browser monitoring PageView events over the last week: SELECT min(duration), max(duration), average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago Copy See more NRQL query examples. NRQL syntax The syntax of a NRQL query is similar to standard SQL queries. Here is a breakdown of the structure of a NRQL query: SELECT function(attribute) [AS 'label'][, ...] FROM data type [WHERE attribute [comparison] [AND|OR ...]][AS 'label'][, ...] [FACET attribute | function(attribute)] [LIMIT number] [SINCE time] [UNTIL time] [WITH TIMEZONE timezone] [COMPARE WITH time] [TIMESERIES time] Copy Basic rules include: NRQL condition Details Required values The SELECT statement and FROM clause are required. All other clauses are optional. You can start your query with either SELECT or FROM. Query string size The query string must be less than 4 KB. Case sensitivity The data type names and attribute names are case sensitive. NRQL clauses and functions are not case sensitive. Syntax for strings NRQL uses single quotes to designate strings. For example: ... where traceId = '030a573f0df02c57' Copy Attribute names with spaces Use backticks `` to quote a custom attribute name that has a space in it. For example: ... FACET `Logged-in user` Copy Data type coercion Insights does not support data type \"coercion.\" For more information, see Data type conversion. Use of math functions Basic and advanced math functions are supported in the SELECT statement.

      "body": "Understanding how high cardinality works is important, because it can impact how quickly you reach your data limits. What is cardinality and why does it matter? Cardinality is generally defined as the number of elements in a set. For dimensional metrics, the set in question is the collection of unique maps of attributes observed for a given metric in a one-day period. You can query the cardinality of a metric in New Relic with the following NRQL format: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(metric.name) SINCE today RAW Copy For example, to query the cardinality of the metric memory.heap and find out how many unique key-value pairs exist for this metric, run the following query: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy Tip We recommend including the RAW clause in cardinality queries that use FROM Metric. This is because in the event your cardinality has been limited, queries like SINCE today will query rollups that are no longer reporting and so need to look at the raw data points to perform the necessary analysis. Note that because querying the raw data points over long time ranges can be slow, RAW queries spanning more than 2 days worth of data are not allowed. While the basics of what cardinality means can be simple to state, learning how to address and manage high cardinality can be a little more complicated. Cardinality limits and enforcement New Relic enforces limits on your metric cardinality both at the per-metric level and at the account level. Cardinality is evaluated over the course of a UTC day, starting at 00:00:00 UTC and ending at 23:59:59 UTC. For more information on data limits and related policies, see New Relic data usage limits and policies Cardinality and dimensional metrics The cardinality of a metric is the size of the set of unique maps of attributes observed for the given metric in a one-day period. If keys or values in that map change over time, they will add new cardinality for that metric. Let's see an example. Imagine a network of 4 hosts, each with 2 containers running on them, and each container periodically reports the gauge metric memory.heap, with the host name and container id added as attributes. When submitted to the Metric API, one of these metrics might look something like this: \"metrics\":[ { \"name\":\"memory.heap\", \"type\":\"gauge\", \"value\":5514, \"timestamp\":1234567890, \"attributes\":{ \"host\":\"W\", \"container\":\"1\" } } ] Copy This metric would then have a cardinality of 8, as that's how many unique mappings of host and container are possible. If a new measurement for this metric is taken with identical attributes as one that had previously reported, no new cardinality would be counted. Cardinality influences As shown above, any changes to the keys or values will represent new cardinality, but predicting how those changes will impact your total cardinality can get a little tricky. It's tempting to assume that the cardinality of a metric is then the product of the number of all possible values for each possible key, but this is rarely the case in practice, as the values a given key often depend on or determine the values of other keys. Using the previous example, once we had a container value of 1, the value of host was fixed to W, assuming those container IDs are globally unique. So while there are 8 containers across 4 hosts, the cardinality is still 8, not 4 * 8 = 32, since most combinations counted by the simple multiplication method are not possible and therefore don't contribute to that metric's cardinality. We will never see the combination of host = 'X', container = 1, for instance. This also means that adding more keys to an attributes map does not necessarily imply an increase to total cardinality. If the value of the new key is uniquely determined by the values of existing keys, it will not add new cardinality in the long term. For instance if you add something like region to your map in the example, it's likely the case that the container value is also fixed to a particular region value, and therefore keeps your cardinality at 8. An important caveat here is that while adding region won't increase the cardinality going forward, it will introduce new cardinality when it is first added. This is because adding keys will make those attribute maps distinct from any that came before them, temporarily increasing the total cardinality for that day. Examples and sample workflows If you hit one of your cardinality limits, there are a couple of options you can use to remedy the situation. One easy answer is increasing your limits, but if you would prefer not to do that, a good alternative is to explore which dimensions are contributing the most to your cardinality and think about removing them if they do not provide value. This can save storage and bandwidth costs and potentially prevent you needing to raise your limits. Find cardinality contributors: metrics Recall how to get the cardinality of a particular metric: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy For the total account cardinality, you can use the same basic query structure and simply omit the metric name: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW Copy The account's cardinality is essentially the sum of each metric's cardinality, so adding in a simple FACET query can help find the highest cardinality metrics: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW FACET metricName Copy Finally, if you believe you have hit one of your cardinality limits, you can confirm this by checking for a related NrIntegrationError: FROM NrIntegrationError SELECT count(*) where name = 'CardinalityViolationException' and newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' facet cardinalityLimitType, metricName, message since today Copy Finding cardinality contributors: dimensions Once you've determined a metric you want to explore, the next step is to determine which dimensions in a given metric contribute the most to its cardinality. If you are unfamiliar with the values of your dimensions, you can look at them like so: FROM Metric SELECT dimensions() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy The JSON results view will likely be advisable here. Looking through these could reveal some dimensions containing a unique ID or other highly variable value that might be worth removing. If you are already familiar with what values your attributes can take on, the keySet() results may be easier to scan: FROM Metric SELECT keySet() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy Understanding the dimensions that have the most influence on your total cardinality comes down to understanding how each key's values correlate with one another. You can experiment with what your cardinality would be without a dimension simply by adding it to the exclude list: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, exclude: {'container.id'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Likewise, there is an include list if that is more convenient to the query context: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, include: {'host.name', 'region'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Managing cardinality can be tricky to conceptualize, but the above methods will help you get answers to questions like \"What metric is contributing the most cardinality?\" and \"What impact does a given attribute(s) have to that total cardinality?\". It's often the case that cardinality tracks with the most unique value, as that value may pin down the possible values other attributes can take on. However, there are plenty of cases where the explosion of possible combinations of a handful of attributes drives the total cardinality. Things that look like unique identifiers are generally a good place to start, but sometimes it's no single key but the combination of two or more keys. The more familiar you are with your data and the systems that generate it, the easier it will be to know which attributes to include or exclude. Tip If you'd like to learn more about limits and troubleshooting the Metric API, here are two good resources: Metric API limits and restricted attributes Troubleshoot Metric API with NRIntegrationError events are both great resources to explore.",

      "body": "New Relic has resource limits in place to protect your experience, our systems, and our other customers. These limits range from the maximum number of characters you can have in a query, to API request rates, to how many events your queries inspect, and more. This page describes the limit metrics and NrIntegrationError events that enable you to view your limits, your current data usage and overall resource consumption as compared to those limits, and the impact of experiencing a limit event. We also provide a handful of queries that, when compiled into a dashboard, can give you consistent insight into your limits status. Important While NrIntegrationError events provide data on many limits types, resource limit metrics currently only cover request rate ingestion and API query rate limits. What happens when you reach a limit Our response to reaching a limit depends on a handful of factors: the type of limit that’s reached, as well as the duration, frequency, and amount at which you exceed the limit. Exceeding a limit doesn’t always mean you experience a limit event, such as dropped data, rejected traffic, or having your data turned off for the rest of the day. We sometimes allow a small buffer before enforcing a limit. That said, any resource consumed above 100% is at risk for limit impact at any time. Many of our rate limits apply proportionally. That means if you’re barely exceeding the limit, we will take less action than if you're exceeding by 200%. Limit metrics are only visible if you're sending data in to a corresponding dataType or limitName API. For example, if you send in data via the Metric API, you’ll see the Metric API resource metrics, but if you don't send any APM data in, you won't see APM resource metrics. Tip Impact metrics will be generated regardless of impact; if there's no impact, you’ll see a 0. An NrIntegrationError event is generated when you experience impact and is a good way to quickly see if you’re experiencing any limit events. See View System Limits for more information. Create a dashboard to view your limit status Using three limit metrics together on a dashboard, you can quickly see detailed visuals of your Ingest Resource Request Per Minute limits, and with NrIntegrationError get a view into more limits. Dashboard displaying limits status using a handful of queries. We used the following queries to create this dashboard. To make a dashboard like this in New Relic One, select Dashboards, and then Create a dashboard. Then, add a new chart for each query you want to regularly monitor. The three limits metrics included in these queries are described in a separate section, below. From left to right, top to bottom: Resource Consumption Limits as a % FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) /latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 facet limitName where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' timeseries limit max Copy Max % Consumption in an hour SELECT max(`usage`) FROM (FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) / latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 as 'usage' facet limitName timeseries ) facet limitName limit max Copy APM Agent API transaction events request per minute FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) where limitName = 'APM Agent API transaction events requests per minute' TIMESERIES Copy Trace API With limit line FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) as 'usage', latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) as 'limit' where limitName = 'Trace API requests per minute' TIMESERIES Copy Impact FACET From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, impact, resource TIMESERIES 1 minute limit max Copy NrIntegrationError by limit FROM NrIntegrationError select count(*) facet limitName TIMESERIES MAX since 1 day ago limit max Copy Multi-Account limits (on time series charts only) If you want to see limits for multiple accounts on one chart: run this query from one of the accounts: FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) / latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 facet limitName, consumingAccountId where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' timeseries limit max Copy Click Add another query. Select a different account. Then run this query again: FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) / latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) * 100 facet limitName, consumingAccountId where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' timeseries limit max Copy Finally, save it. Limit list and NrIntegrationError FROM Metric, NrIntegrationError select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute) as 'Per Minute Count',latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) as ' limit Value',(rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute)/latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue)*100)as 'Percent Used', filter (count(*), where NrIntegrationError.limitValue is not null) as 'limit reached count' facet limitName limit 1000 Copy Limit metrics These metrics, used in the dashboard queries above, can hone in on a single limit or resource. Or, with the help of FACET limitName or resource provide a view across all your limits. newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue limitValue allows you to see the setting for a limit by limitName and understand more about what resource is linked to this limit. The following examples use the limit value metric in the query: Example for Metric API requests per minute. FROM Metric select latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) where limitName = 'Metric API requests per minute' Copy To show all limits, add FACET limitName and consider grouping by limitTimeInterval. FROM Metric select latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue) WHERE limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' FACET limitName limit max Copy newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue currentValue shows you how much of a given resource you’re currently consuming. To get a better glimpse into how our systems are viewing your consumption, use a rate() function with the time period that aligns with the limitTimeInterval. Limit 200. Example for Metric API request per minute: FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue),1 minute) where limitName = 'Metric API requests per minute' Copy To show all limits, add FACET limitName and consider grouping by limitTimeInterval. FROM Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue),1 minute) where limitTimeInterval = '1 minute' FACET limitName limit max Copy newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact impact lets you know for any given resource what impact limit events are having. Zeros mean you are not currently impacted. The most granular we have is dataType. It is possible for multiple instances of limitName to impact a single type, such as Metric RPM and DPM. If we know, we will display limitName. From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, resource, impact, limitName TIMESERIES limit max Copy Metric attributes Attributes on newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue and newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue: limitName - The Name of the limit for the metric data, i.e RPM Metric API. dataType - What kind of data the metric is tracking, i.e Metric, Log, or APM. Resource - What resource is being consumed, i.e. Requests, or DPM. limitTimeInterval - What time window this resource is evaluated for limiting. consumingAccountId - The New Relic account where the resource is being consumed. Attributes on newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact dataType - The kind of data that is being impacted, i.e Metric, Log, APM. Resource - What resource is being impacted, i.e Request Rate. Impact - A count of what is happening when resource has exceeded set limit, i.e dropped requests. consumingAccountId - The New Relic account where the resource is being consumed. Set alerts on resource metrics While building a dashboard to see all your limits is handy, being able to automate it is even better. You can set alerts on your limit metrics to provide updates on limits changes. Tip Because we currently only have metrics on 1 minute time windows, setting TimeWindow = 1 minute, will cover them all. Eventually, we make more metrics available, you might want to set separate alerts for limits that are enforced by different time windows. You can use the following NRQL queries to create alerts. Learn about creating alerts with NRQL queries here. Limits faceted by LimitName and scoped by Timewindow From Metric select (rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute)/latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue))*100 facet limitName Copy Alert on a single limit From Metric select (rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.currentValue), 1 minute)/latest(newrelic.resourceConsumption.limitValue))*100 where limitName = 'my limit' Copy Alert on limit impact faceted by dataType, impact, resource, and reason From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, impact, resource, reason Copy Alert on impact of a single dataType From Metric select rate(sum(newrelic.resourceConsumption.impact), 1 minute) facet dataType, impact, resource, reason WHERE dataType = 'important things' Copy",

      "body": "To ensure our systems are always up and ready to support you, and to keep you from unintended use, we place limits on the amount of data you can send, query, and store. Responses to limit violations Limits are enforced per child account, and across our APIs. You might reach a limit if you start monitoring a new high-traffic application, or have a sudden data spike. When you do reach a limit, New Relic responds according to the type of data and the limit that’s reached. For example: We place a limit on the number of ingested requests per minute (RPM) per data type. When this limit is reached, we stop accepting data and return a 429 status code for the duration of the minute. For queries, we place limits on the number of queries per minute and the number of records inspected (see query limits). When the number of queries per minute limit is reached, New Relic will begin rejecting queries until the number of queries is below the limit. When the records inspected limit is reached, New Relic will reject traffic from the source scanning the largest number of records and attempt to allow traffic from other sources. For metrics, we place a limit on the number of unique timeseries (cardinality) per account and per metric. When this limit is reached, aggregated data is turned off for the rest of the UTC day. For every major limit violation, New Relic creates an NrIntegrationError event for that account, which has these limit-related attributes: Attribute Description category RateLimit or ApiLimit. The RateLimit category is used for limits based on a unit of time such as the number of requests ingested per minute. The ApiLimit is used for constant limits, such as the number of attributes on a record. limitName The name of the limit. message Describes the limit and the impact. limitValue The limit reached. System limits UI The system Limits page (from the account dropdown, click Manage your data and click Limits on the left) displays when your account has encountered a rate limit in the specified time period. The page displays a default period of 24 hours; you can set a custom range from the top-right of the page. Non-limit-related NrIntegrationError events are not displayed here. In addition, this page does not display information about limits you have not hit, or how close you are to reaching a limit.

To add more detail, or build a dashboard, click the View NRQL button on the chart to see the NRQL powering this view. The graph displays each unique limit type that was reached during the selected time-period. This can help you find any trends based on time. The Limits page also provides a table where you can find the limit name, the limit event message associated with it, and last occurrence time and date. If you click a limit in the table, you see more about what happened, and when. one.newrelic.com > account dropdown > Manage your data > Limits: An example of a limit events table on the Limits UI page. Troubleshooting system limits To troubleshoot limits when you reach them, click the limit info in the table, and then follow the docs link that's provided. Different limits have different solutions. Account-level limits The following table includes general max limits that apply across all New Relic accounts. Specific New Relic tools, like agents and integrations, have their own limits and configurations, and might be lower than these theoretical maximum limits. Limited condition Limit Rate of NRDB record * ingest 55 million per account per minute Max NRDB records * ingested per API call 1MB (10^6 bytes) Max attribute value size 1KB (10^3 bytes) Max payload size 1MB (10^6 bytes) Max total attributes per data type (including default attributes) 254 (less for some tools; for example, 64 for agents) Number of unique custom data types 250 per account per day (applies to custom events because that's source of new data types) APM limits Agent instances: 50K per account Agent instances per app: 10K APM apps/services: 10K per second Browser: number of page views 1M per minute per app Distributed tracing: Max age of span timestamp values 20 minutes. Timestamp must be within 20 minutes of current time at ingest or within 20 minutes from the time the last span with the same trace.id was received by New Relic.

Timeseries received above this limit are dropped. This limit is enforced prior to and in addition to standard Metric limits. Additional account conditions Metric API limits apply at the individual account level. Trial and paid accounts receive a 1M DPM and 1M cardinality limit for trial purposes, but you can request up to 15M DPM and 15M cardinality for your account. To request changes to your metric rate limits, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Rate limit violations This section describes how the Metric API behaves when you exceed the rate limits, and how to respond if limits are exceeded. Max data points per minute (DPM) Data points per minute refers to the per minute rate at which individual metric values are sent to the Metric API. When the maximum DPM limit is exceeded for an account, the New Relic Metric API returns a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. To resolve this issue, either reduce the number of data points you are sending, or request a rate limit change. Subsequent subscription changes do not impact modified rate limits. If an account change impacts your rate limit, you must notify us to adjust your rate limit. To request rate limit changes, contact your New Relic account representative, or visit our Support portal. Max unique timeseries per account per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-account, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max unique timeseries per metric name per day A timeseries is a single, unique combination of a metric name and any attributes assigned to that metric. For example, if a CPU utilization metric with a single attribute hostname is sent from ten different hosts, this equals ten distinct values for the hostname attribute and ten unique metric timeseries. If the per-metric name, per-day unique metric timeseries (cardinality) limit is exceeded during a 24 hour period, the endpoint will continue to receive and store raw metric data. However, New Relic will stop creating additional aggregate rollups (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for the remainder of the 24 hour period. (These rollups are used used by default to query time windows longer than 60 minutes.) You can continue to query your data when such a violation occurs by specifying a 60 minute or shorter time window or specifying the RAW keyword as described in view and query your metrics. This can be helpful in identifying potential causes for the violation. Max payloads per minute If you make more than 100k POST requests to the Metric API endpoint within a minute, the endpoint will return a 429 response for the remainder of the minute. The response will include a Retry-After header indicating how long to wait in seconds before resubmitting or sending new data. In general, if you reach this limit, consider creating larger payloads. To do this, combine more data points into each request to reduce the number of POSTs that are necessary. If this is not an option, you can request a rate limit increase by contacting your New Relic account representative or visiting our Support portal. Restricted attributes These attributes are restricted by the New Relic platform. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point will cause the data point to be dropped, or the value to be omitted or overwritten: Attribute Description newrelic.source This resets to the value metricAPI. metricName This resets to the name value passed into each data point. This allows name to be an attribute key. endTimestamp timestamp and interval.ms will be converted to an endTimestamp for the data point. These attributes are used internally to identify entities. Any values submitted with these keys in the attributes section of a metric data point may cause undefined behavior such as missing entities in the UI or telemetry not associating with the expected entities. For more information please refer to Entity synthesis: Attribute Description entity.guid Unique identifier assigned to an entity by New Relic. entity.name Human-readable name of an entity, often used to identify an entity in the UI. entity.type Used to differentiate between different types of entities, like hosts, applications, etc. Additional restrictions include: Restriction Comments Metric and attribute names You cannot pass the same value for metric name and attribute name. In the following example, the metric is invalid because the metric is named service.errors.all and there is an attribute service.errors.all. Example: Metric value used as an attribute (invalid) [ { \"metrics\": [ { \"name\": \"service.errors.all\" , \"type\": \"count\", \"value\": 15, \"timestamp\": 1531414060739, \"interval.ms\": 10000, \"attributes\": { \"service.response.statuscode\": \"400\", \"service.errors.all\" : \"test\", \"service.name\": \"foo\" } } ] } ] Copy Reserved words The Metric API inherits some reserved words from New Relic Insights, including accountID, appId, and eventType. Additionally, the syntax terms for NRQL are restricted unless you backtick (``) them. For a full list, see Reserved words: NRQL syntax terms. Keys within metric JSON All keys used within the metric JSON cannot be attribute keys. This includes interval.ms, timestamp, value, common, min, max, count, sum, and metrics.

      "body": "Understanding how high cardinality works is important, because it can impact how quickly you reach your data limits. What is cardinality and why does it matter? Cardinality is generally defined as the number of elements in a set. For dimensional metrics, the set in question is the collection of unique maps of attributes observed for a given metric in a one-day period. You can query the cardinality of a metric in New Relic with the following NRQL format: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(metric.name) SINCE today RAW Copy For example, to query the cardinality of the metric memory.heap and find out how many unique key-value pairs exist for this metric, run the following query: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy Tip We recommend including the RAW clause in cardinality queries that use FROM Metric. This is because in the event your cardinality has been limited, queries like SINCE today will query rollups that are no longer reporting and so need to look at the raw data points to perform the necessary analysis. Note that because querying the raw data points over long time ranges can be slow, RAW queries spanning more than 2 days worth of data are not allowed. While the basics of what cardinality means can be simple to state, learning how to address and manage high cardinality can be a little more complicated. Cardinality limits and enforcement New Relic enforces limits on your metric cardinality both at the per-metric level and at the account level. Cardinality is evaluated over the course of a UTC day, starting at 00:00:00 UTC and ending at 23:59:59 UTC. For more information on data limits and related policies, see New Relic data usage limits and policies Cardinality and dimensional metrics The cardinality of a metric is the size of the set of unique maps of attributes observed for the given metric in a one-day period. If keys or values in that map change over time, they will add new cardinality for that metric. Let's see an example. Imagine a network of 4 hosts, each with 2 containers running on them, and each container periodically reports the gauge metric memory.heap, with the host name and container id added as attributes. When submitted to the Metric API, one of these metrics might look something like this: \"metrics\":[ { \"name\":\"memory.heap\", \"type\":\"gauge\", \"value\":5514, \"timestamp\":1234567890, \"attributes\":{ \"host\":\"W\", \"container\":\"1\" } } ] Copy This metric would then have a cardinality of 8, as that's how many unique mappings of host and container are possible. If a new measurement for this metric is taken with identical attributes as one that had previously reported, no new cardinality would be counted. Cardinality influences As shown above, any changes to the keys or values will represent new cardinality, but predicting how those changes will impact your total cardinality can get a little tricky. It's tempting to assume that the cardinality of a metric is then the product of the number of all possible values for each possible key, but this is rarely the case in practice, as the values a given key often depend on or determine the values of other keys. Using the previous example, once we had a container value of 1, the value of host was fixed to W, assuming those container IDs are globally unique. So while there are 8 containers across 4 hosts, the cardinality is still 8, not 4 * 8 = 32, since most combinations counted by the simple multiplication method are not possible and therefore don't contribute to that metric's cardinality. We will never see the combination of host = 'X', container = 1, for instance. This also means that adding more keys to an attributes map does not necessarily imply an increase to total cardinality. If the value of the new key is uniquely determined by the values of existing keys, it will not add new cardinality in the long term. For instance if you add something like region to your map in the example, it's likely the case that the container value is also fixed to a particular region value, and therefore keeps your cardinality at 8. An important caveat here is that while adding region won't increase the cardinality going forward, it will introduce new cardinality when it is first added. This is because adding keys will make those attribute maps distinct from any that came before them, temporarily increasing the total cardinality for that day. Examples and sample workflows If you hit one of your cardinality limits, there are a couple of options you can use to remedy the situation. One easy answer is increasing your limits, but if you would prefer not to do that, a good alternative is to explore which dimensions are contributing the most to your cardinality and think about removing them if they do not provide value. This can save storage and bandwidth costs and potentially prevent you needing to raise your limits. Find cardinality contributors: metrics Recall how to get the cardinality of a particular metric: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy For the total account cardinality, you can use the same basic query structure and simply omit the metric name: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW Copy The account's cardinality is essentially the sum of each metric's cardinality, so adding in a simple FACET query can help find the highest cardinality metrics: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW FACET metricName Copy Finally, if you believe you have hit one of your cardinality limits, you can confirm this by checking for a related NrIntegrationError: FROM NrIntegrationError SELECT count(*) where name = 'CardinalityViolationException' and newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' facet cardinalityLimitType, metricName, message since today Copy Finding cardinality contributors: dimensions Once you've determined a metric you want to explore, the next step is to determine which dimensions in a given metric contribute the most to its cardinality. If you are unfamiliar with the values of your dimensions, you can look at them like so: FROM Metric SELECT dimensions() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy The JSON results view will likely be advisable here. Looking through these could reveal some dimensions containing a unique ID or other highly variable value that might be worth removing. If you are already familiar with what values your attributes can take on, the keySet() results may be easier to scan: FROM Metric SELECT keySet() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy Understanding the dimensions that have the most influence on your total cardinality comes down to understanding how each key's values correlate with one another. You can experiment with what your cardinality would be without a dimension simply by adding it to the exclude list: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, exclude: {'container.id'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Likewise, there is an include list if that is more convenient to the query context: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, include: {'host.name', 'region'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Managing cardinality can be tricky to conceptualize, but the above methods will help you get answers to questions like \"What metric is contributing the most cardinality?\" and \"What impact does a given attribute(s) have to that total cardinality?\". It's often the case that cardinality tracks with the most unique value, as that value may pin down the possible values other attributes can take on. However, there are plenty of cases where the explosion of possible combinations of a handful of attributes drives the total cardinality. Things that look like unique identifiers are generally a good place to start, but sometimes it's no single key but the combination of two or more keys. The more familiar you are with your data and the systems that generate it, the easier it will be to know which attributes to include or exclude.

All infrastructure metrics are stored as event data in New Relic, but you can also query them through dimensional metrics. In this page you can learn: The benefits of dimensional metrics. A few examples on how and where to use them. Known issues. Why it matters At New Relic we report metrics in several ways, including dimensional metrics, which are used by our metric API, Telemetry SDK, some open-source integrations, and our infrastructure services. This type of metric enables you to: Enjoy an improved query experience for Infrastructure data. Discover all your metrics in one place. Tap into more metric sources, such as Prometheus. For example, the query to get the maximum duration of your Lambda functions is simplified: Query with samples FROM ServerlessSample SELECT max(provider.duration.Maximum) WHERE provider = 'LambdaFunction' Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(aws.lambda.function.duration) Copy Get started No agent or integration updates are required to use these metrics. NRQL alerting based on dimensional metrics is also supported, except for data coming from cloud integrations (that is metrics from AWS polling integrations, GCP, and Azure). AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams metrics are ingested as dimensional metrics and NRQL alerts are recommended. Where and how to query dimensional metrics All current NRQL query features are supported. Queries can use WHERE, FACET, and time selection functions such as SINCE, UNTIL, and COMPARE WITH. The query builder in New Relic One supports metrics in both simple and advanced (NRQL) mode. Naming conventions for metrics and attributes All metric names and attributes for dimensional metrics follow the same naming convention in order to make them easy to find and use. Metric and attribute names are namespaced with dots: for example, the host. prefix is used for host metrics, the k8s. prefix is used for Kubernetes metrics, and aws. is used for AWS metrics. The graphic below shows how a ProcessSample that contains three metrics (cpuPercent, ioTotalReadBytes, and ioTotalWriteBytes) is split into three separate metrics. Note the updated naming of the metrics and the attributes. Dimensional metrics naming convention Examples Here are some examples of NQRL queries with and without dimensional metrics: AWS EBS query example Get the total write time by EBS Volume. Query with samples FROM BlockDeviceSample SELECT sum('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' FACET entityName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(aws.ebs.volume.TotalWriteTime) FACET entity.name Copy Azure Service bus query example Maximum number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic by resource group. Query with samples FROM AzureServiceBusTopicSample SELECT max(activeMessages.Maximum) FACET resourceGroupName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(azure.servicebus.topic.activeMessages) FACET azure.resourceGroup Copy Azure functions query example Number of function executions Azure Functions over the past 6 hours by region over time.

For example, SELECT uniques(tags.environment) FROM Metric WHERE metricName='aws.lambda.function.duration' does not work without the WHERE clause. Results may not be complete if the selection criteria matches too many samples.

      "body": "Understanding how high cardinality works is important, because it can impact how quickly you reach your data limits. What is cardinality and why does it matter? Cardinality is generally defined as the number of elements in a set. For dimensional metrics, the set in question is the collection of unique maps of attributes observed for a given metric in a one-day period. You can query the cardinality of a metric in New Relic with the following NRQL format: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(metric.name) SINCE today RAW Copy For example, to query the cardinality of the metric memory.heap and find out how many unique key-value pairs exist for this metric, run the following query: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy Tip We recommend including the RAW clause in cardinality queries that use FROM Metric. This is because in the event your cardinality has been limited, queries like SINCE today will query rollups that are no longer reporting and so need to look at the raw data points to perform the necessary analysis. Note that because querying the raw data points over long time ranges can be slow, RAW queries spanning more than 2 days worth of data are not allowed. While the basics of what cardinality means can be simple to state, learning how to address and manage high cardinality can be a little more complicated. Cardinality limits and enforcement New Relic enforces limits on your metric cardinality both at the per-metric level and at the account level. Cardinality is evaluated over the course of a UTC day, starting at 00:00:00 UTC and ending at 23:59:59 UTC. For more information on data limits and related policies, see New Relic data usage limits and policies Cardinality and dimensional metrics The cardinality of a metric is the size of the set of unique maps of attributes observed for the given metric in a one-day period. If keys or values in that map change over time, they will add new cardinality for that metric. Let's see an example. Imagine a network of 4 hosts, each with 2 containers running on them, and each container periodically reports the gauge metric memory.heap, with the host name and container id added as attributes. When submitted to the Metric API, one of these metrics might look something like this: \"metrics\":[ { \"name\":\"memory.heap\", \"type\":\"gauge\", \"value\":5514, \"timestamp\":1234567890, \"attributes\":{ \"host\":\"W\", \"container\":\"1\" } } ] Copy This metric would then have a cardinality of 8, as that's how many unique mappings of host and container are possible. If a new measurement for this metric is taken with identical attributes as one that had previously reported, no new cardinality would be counted. Cardinality influences As shown above, any changes to the keys or values will represent new cardinality, but predicting how those changes will impact your total cardinality can get a little tricky. It's tempting to assume that the cardinality of a metric is then the product of the number of all possible values for each possible key, but this is rarely the case in practice, as the values a given key often depend on or determine the values of other keys. Using the previous example, once we had a container value of 1, the value of host was fixed to W, assuming those container IDs are globally unique. So while there are 8 containers across 4 hosts, the cardinality is still 8, not 4 * 8 = 32, since most combinations counted by the simple multiplication method are not possible and therefore don't contribute to that metric's cardinality. We will never see the combination of host = 'X', container = 1, for instance. This also means that adding more keys to an attributes map does not necessarily imply an increase to total cardinality. If the value of the new key is uniquely determined by the values of existing keys, it will not add new cardinality in the long term. For instance if you add something like region to your map in the example, it's likely the case that the container value is also fixed to a particular region value, and therefore keeps your cardinality at 8. An important caveat here is that while adding region won't increase the cardinality going forward, it will introduce new cardinality when it is first added. This is because adding keys will make those attribute maps distinct from any that came before them, temporarily increasing the total cardinality for that day. Examples and sample workflows If you hit one of your cardinality limits, there are a couple of options you can use to remedy the situation. One easy answer is increasing your limits, but if you would prefer not to do that, a good alternative is to explore which dimensions are contributing the most to your cardinality and think about removing them if they do not provide value. This can save storage and bandwidth costs and potentially prevent you needing to raise your limits. Find cardinality contributors: metrics Recall how to get the cardinality of a particular metric: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy For the total account cardinality, you can use the same basic query structure and simply omit the metric name: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW Copy The account's cardinality is essentially the sum of each metric's cardinality, so adding in a simple FACET query can help find the highest cardinality metrics: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW FACET metricName Copy Finally, if you believe you have hit one of your cardinality limits, you can confirm this by checking for a related NrIntegrationError: FROM NrIntegrationError SELECT count(*) where name = 'CardinalityViolationException' and newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' facet cardinalityLimitType, metricName, message since today Copy Finding cardinality contributors: dimensions Once you've determined a metric you want to explore, the next step is to determine which dimensions in a given metric contribute the most to its cardinality. If you are unfamiliar with the values of your dimensions, you can look at them like so: FROM Metric SELECT dimensions() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy The JSON results view will likely be advisable here. Looking through these could reveal some dimensions containing a unique ID or other highly variable value that might be worth removing. If you are already familiar with what values your attributes can take on, the keySet() results may be easier to scan: FROM Metric SELECT keySet() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy Understanding the dimensions that have the most influence on your total cardinality comes down to understanding how each key's values correlate with one another. You can experiment with what your cardinality would be without a dimension simply by adding it to the exclude list: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, exclude: {'container.id'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Likewise, there is an include list if that is more convenient to the query context: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, include: {'host.name', 'region'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Managing cardinality can be tricky to conceptualize, but the above methods will help you get answers to questions like \"What metric is contributing the most cardinality?\" and \"What impact does a given attribute(s) have to that total cardinality?\". It's often the case that cardinality tracks with the most unique value, as that value may pin down the possible values other attributes can take on. However, there are plenty of cases where the explosion of possible combinations of a handful of attributes drives the total cardinality. Things that look like unique identifiers are generally a good place to start, but sometimes it's no single key but the combination of two or more keys. The more familiar you are with your data and the systems that generate it, the easier it will be to know which attributes to include or exclude. Tip If you'd like to learn more about limits and troubleshooting the Metric API, here are two good resources: Metric API limits and restricted attributes Troubleshoot Metric API with NRIntegrationError events are both great resources to explore.",

All infrastructure metrics are stored as event data in New Relic, but you can also query them through dimensional metrics. In this page you can learn: The benefits of dimensional metrics. A few examples on how and where to use them. Known issues. Why it matters At New Relic we report metrics in several ways, including dimensional metrics, which are used by our metric API, Telemetry SDK, some open-source integrations, and our infrastructure services. This type of metric enables you to: Enjoy an improved query experience for Infrastructure data. Discover all your metrics in one place. Tap into more metric sources, such as Prometheus. For example, the query to get the maximum duration of your Lambda functions is simplified: Query with samples FROM ServerlessSample SELECT max(provider.duration.Maximum) WHERE provider = 'LambdaFunction' Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(aws.lambda.function.duration) Copy Get started No agent or integration updates are required to use these metrics. NRQL alerting based on dimensional metrics is also supported, except for data coming from cloud integrations (that is metrics from AWS polling integrations, GCP, and Azure). AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams metrics are ingested as dimensional metrics and NRQL alerts are recommended. Where and how to query dimensional metrics All current NRQL query features are supported. Queries can use WHERE, FACET, and time selection functions such as SINCE, UNTIL, and COMPARE WITH. The query builder in New Relic One supports metrics in both simple and advanced (NRQL) mode. Naming conventions for metrics and attributes All metric names and attributes for dimensional metrics follow the same naming convention in order to make them easy to find and use. Metric and attribute names are namespaced with dots: for example, the host. prefix is used for host metrics, the k8s. prefix is used for Kubernetes metrics, and aws. is used for AWS metrics. The graphic below shows how a ProcessSample that contains three metrics (cpuPercent, ioTotalReadBytes, and ioTotalWriteBytes) is split into three separate metrics. Note the updated naming of the metrics and the attributes. Dimensional metrics naming convention Examples Here are some examples of NQRL queries with and without dimensional metrics: AWS EBS query example Get the total write time by EBS Volume. Query with samples FROM BlockDeviceSample SELECT sum('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' FACET entityName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(aws.ebs.volume.TotalWriteTime) FACET entity.name Copy Azure Service bus query example Maximum number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic by resource group. Query with samples FROM AzureServiceBusTopicSample SELECT max(activeMessages.Maximum) FACET resourceGroupName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(azure.servicebus.topic.activeMessages) FACET azure.resourceGroup Copy Azure functions query example Number of function executions Azure Functions over the past 6 hours by region over time.

Query with samples FROM NginxSample SELECT average(net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy MySQL query example The maximum number of used MySQL connections. Query with samples FROM MysqlSample SELECT max(net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(mysql.node.net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Known limitations Metric queries with * do not return Infrastructure sample data (for example, SELECT * FROM Metric). In order to select attributes starting with tags. a metric name has to be provided. For example, SELECT uniques(tags.environment) FROM Metric WHERE metricName='aws.lambda.function.duration' does not work without the WHERE clause. Results may not be complete if the selection criteria matches too many samples. For example, SELECT uniqueCount(entity.guid) FROM Metric maps to all Infrastructure samples, and may return incomplete results.

      "body": "Understanding how high cardinality works is important, because it can impact how quickly you reach your data limits. What is cardinality and why does it matter? Cardinality is generally defined as the number of elements in a set. For dimensional metrics, the set in question is the collection of unique maps of attributes observed for a given metric in a one-day period. You can query the cardinality of a metric in New Relic with the following NRQL format: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(metric.name) SINCE today RAW Copy For example, to query the cardinality of the metric memory.heap and find out how many unique key-value pairs exist for this metric, run the following query: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy Tip We recommend including the RAW clause in cardinality queries that use FROM Metric. This is because in the event your cardinality has been limited, queries like SINCE today will query rollups that are no longer reporting and so need to look at the raw data points to perform the necessary analysis. Note that because querying the raw data points over long time ranges can be slow, RAW queries spanning more than 2 days worth of data are not allowed. While the basics of what cardinality means can be simple to state, learning how to address and manage high cardinality can be a little more complicated. Cardinality limits and enforcement New Relic enforces limits on your metric cardinality both at the per-metric level and at the account level. Cardinality is evaluated over the course of a UTC day, starting at 00:00:00 UTC and ending at 23:59:59 UTC. For more information on data limits and related policies, see New Relic data usage limits and policies Cardinality and dimensional metrics The cardinality of a metric is the size of the set of unique maps of attributes observed for the given metric in a one-day period. If keys or values in that map change over time, they will add new cardinality for that metric. Let's see an example. Imagine a network of 4 hosts, each with 2 containers running on them, and each container periodically reports the gauge metric memory.heap, with the host name and container id added as attributes. When submitted to the Metric API, one of these metrics might look something like this: \"metrics\":[ { \"name\":\"memory.heap\", \"type\":\"gauge\", \"value\":5514, \"timestamp\":1234567890, \"attributes\":{ \"host\":\"W\", \"container\":\"1\" } } ] Copy This metric would then have a cardinality of 8, as that's how many unique mappings of host and container are possible. If a new measurement for this metric is taken with identical attributes as one that had previously reported, no new cardinality would be counted. Cardinality influences As shown above, any changes to the keys or values will represent new cardinality, but predicting how those changes will impact your total cardinality can get a little tricky. It's tempting to assume that the cardinality of a metric is then the product of the number of all possible values for each possible key, but this is rarely the case in practice, as the values a given key often depend on or determine the values of other keys. Using the previous example, once we had a container value of 1, the value of host was fixed to W, assuming those container IDs are globally unique. So while there are 8 containers across 4 hosts, the cardinality is still 8, not 4 * 8 = 32, since most combinations counted by the simple multiplication method are not possible and therefore don't contribute to that metric's cardinality. We will never see the combination of host = 'X', container = 1, for instance. This also means that adding more keys to an attributes map does not necessarily imply an increase to total cardinality. If the value of the new key is uniquely determined by the values of existing keys, it will not add new cardinality in the long term. For instance if you add something like region to your map in the example, it's likely the case that the container value is also fixed to a particular region value, and therefore keeps your cardinality at 8. An important caveat here is that while adding region won't increase the cardinality going forward, it will introduce new cardinality when it is first added. This is because adding keys will make those attribute maps distinct from any that came before them, temporarily increasing the total cardinality for that day. Examples and sample workflows If you hit one of your cardinality limits, there are a couple of options you can use to remedy the situation. One easy answer is increasing your limits, but if you would prefer not to do that, a good alternative is to explore which dimensions are contributing the most to your cardinality and think about removing them if they do not provide value. This can save storage and bandwidth costs and potentially prevent you needing to raise your limits. Find cardinality contributors: metrics Recall how to get the cardinality of a particular metric: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap) SINCE today RAW Copy For the total account cardinality, you can use the same basic query structure and simply omit the metric name: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW Copy The account's cardinality is essentially the sum of each metric's cardinality, so adding in a simple FACET query can help find the highest cardinality metrics: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality() SINCE today RAW FACET metricName Copy Finally, if you believe you have hit one of your cardinality limits, you can confirm this by checking for a related NrIntegrationError: FROM NrIntegrationError SELECT count(*) where name = 'CardinalityViolationException' and newRelicFeature = 'Metrics' facet cardinalityLimitType, metricName, message since today Copy Finding cardinality contributors: dimensions Once you've determined a metric you want to explore, the next step is to determine which dimensions in a given metric contribute the most to its cardinality. If you are unfamiliar with the values of your dimensions, you can look at them like so: FROM Metric SELECT dimensions() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy The JSON results view will likely be advisable here. Looking through these could reveal some dimensions containing a unique ID or other highly variable value that might be worth removing. If you are already familiar with what values your attributes can take on, the keySet() results may be easier to scan: FROM Metric SELECT keySet() WHERE metricName = 'memory.heap' SINCE today RAW Copy Understanding the dimensions that have the most influence on your total cardinality comes down to understanding how each key's values correlate with one another. You can experiment with what your cardinality would be without a dimension simply by adding it to the exclude list: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, exclude: {'container.id'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Likewise, there is an include list if that is more convenient to the query context: FROM Metric SELECT cardinality(memory.heap, include: {'host.name', 'region'}) SINCE today RAW Copy Managing cardinality can be tricky to conceptualize, but the above methods will help you get answers to questions like \"What metric is contributing the most cardinality?\" and \"What impact does a given attribute(s) have to that total cardinality?\". It's often the case that cardinality tracks with the most unique value, as that value may pin down the possible values other attributes can take on. However, there are plenty of cases where the explosion of possible combinations of a handful of attributes drives the total cardinality. Things that look like unique identifiers are generally a good place to start, but sometimes it's no single key but the combination of two or more keys. The more familiar you are with your data and the systems that generate it, the easier it will be to know which attributes to include or exclude. Tip If you'd like to learn more about limits and troubleshooting the Metric API, here are two good resources: Metric API limits and restricted attributes Troubleshoot Metric API with NRIntegrationError events are both great resources to explore.",

All infrastructure metrics are stored as event data in New Relic, but you can also query them through dimensional metrics. In this page you can learn: The benefits of dimensional metrics. A few examples on how and where to use them. Known issues. Why it matters At New Relic we report metrics in several ways, including dimensional metrics, which are used by our metric API, Telemetry SDK, some open-source integrations, and our infrastructure services. This type of metric enables you to: Enjoy an improved query experience for Infrastructure data. Discover all your metrics in one place. Tap into more metric sources, such as Prometheus. For example, the query to get the maximum duration of your Lambda functions is simplified: Query with samples FROM ServerlessSample SELECT max(provider.duration.Maximum) WHERE provider = 'LambdaFunction' Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(aws.lambda.function.duration) Copy Get started No agent or integration updates are required to use these metrics. NRQL alerting based on dimensional metrics is also supported, except for data coming from cloud integrations (that is metrics from AWS polling integrations, GCP, and Azure). AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams metrics are ingested as dimensional metrics and NRQL alerts are recommended. Where and how to query dimensional metrics All current NRQL query features are supported. Queries can use WHERE, FACET, and time selection functions such as SINCE, UNTIL, and COMPARE WITH. The query builder in New Relic One supports metrics in both simple and advanced (NRQL) mode. Naming conventions for metrics and attributes All metric names and attributes for dimensional metrics follow the same naming convention in order to make them easy to find and use. Metric and attribute names are namespaced with dots: for example, the host. prefix is used for host metrics, the k8s. prefix is used for Kubernetes metrics, and aws. is used for AWS metrics. The graphic below shows how a ProcessSample that contains three metrics (cpuPercent, ioTotalReadBytes, and ioTotalWriteBytes) is split into three separate metrics. Note the updated naming of the metrics and the attributes. Dimensional metrics naming convention Examples Here are some examples of NQRL queries with and without dimensional metrics: AWS EBS query example Get the total write time by EBS Volume. Query with samples FROM BlockDeviceSample SELECT sum('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' FACET entityName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT sum(aws.ebs.volume.TotalWriteTime) FACET entity.name Copy Azure Service bus query example Maximum number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic by resource group. Query with samples FROM AzureServiceBusTopicSample SELECT max(activeMessages.Maximum) FACET resourceGroupName Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(azure.servicebus.topic.activeMessages) FACET azure.resourceGroup Copy Azure functions query example Number of function executions Azure Functions over the past 6 hours by region over time.

Query with samples FROM NginxSample SELECT average(net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT average(nginx.server.net.requestsPerSecond) TIMESERIES Copy MySQL query example The maximum number of used MySQL connections. Query with samples FROM MysqlSample SELECT max(net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Query with metrics FROM Metric SELECT max(mysql.node.net.maxUsedConnections) Copy Known limitations Metric queries with * do not return Infrastructure sample data (for example, SELECT * FROM Metric). In order to select attributes starting with tags. a metric name has to be provided. For example, SELECT uniques(tags.environment) FROM Metric WHERE metricName='aws.lambda.function.duration' does not work without the WHERE clause. Results may not be complete if the selection criteria matches too many samples. For example, SELECT uniqueCount(entity.guid) FROM Metric maps to all Infrastructure samples, and may return incomplete results.
