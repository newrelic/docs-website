      "body": "Problem You've followed the steps to link your AWS account, configured the AWS CloudWatch metrics stream and AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, and you still don't see the expected metrics in New Relic. Solutions No metrics or errors appear on New Relic If you are not seeing data in New Relic once the AWS CloudWatch Metric Stream has been connected to AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, then follow the steps below to troubleshoot your configuration: Check that the Metric Stream is in a state of Running via the AWS console or API. Please refer to AWS Troubleshooting docs for additional details. Check the Metric Stream metrics under AWS/CloudWatch/MetricStreams namespace. You will see a count of metric updates and errors per Metric Streams. This indicates that the Metric Stream is successfully emitting data. If you see errors, confirm the IAM role specified in the Metric Streams configuration grants the CloudWatch service principal permissions to write. Check the Monitoring tab of the Kinesis Data Firehose in the Kinesis console to see if the Firehose is successfully receiving data. You can enable CloudWatch error logging on your Kinesis Data Firehose to get more detailed information for debugging issues. Refer to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose official documentation for more details. Confirm that you have configured your Kinesis Data Firehose with the correct destination details: Ensure the New Relic API Key/License Key contains your 40 hexadecimal character license key. Ensure the right data center US or EU has been selected for your New Relic account. Tip: If the license_key starts with “eu” then you need to select the EU data center. Check that your Kinesis Data Firehose has permissions to write to the configured destination. For example, the S3 bucket policy allows to write. Missing metrics for certain AWS namespaces New Relic doesn't apply any filter on the metrics received from the AWS CloudWatch metric stream. If you're expecting certain metrics to be ingested and they aren't, verify the following: Make sure there’s no Inclusion or Exclusion filter in your CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure metrics are available in AWS CloudWatch and can be queried in the AWS CloudWatch interface. For some specific AWS services, such as ECS/ EKS container insights, enhanced monitoring needs to be explicitly enabled in AWS-sdide before getting access to the metrics. Important AWS CloudWatch doesn't include metrics that are not available in less than 2 hours. For example, some S3 metrics are aggregated on a daily basis. We plan to make some of these special metrics available in New Relic. Metric values discrepancies between AWS CloudWatch and New Relic Metrics are processed, mapped, and stored as received from AWS CloudWatch metric stream. Some discrepancies might be observed when comparing AWS CloudWatch and New Relic dashboards. On limited scenarios, AWS CloudWatch applies specific functions and logic before rendering the metrics. These guidelines should help understand the root cause of the discrepancy: Check that the same function is used on the metrics (for example average, min, max). On the New Relic side, make sure you filter the same timestamp or timeframe (considering the timezone) to show the exact same time as in AWS CloudWatch. When using timeseries, the New Relic user interface might perform some rounding based on intervals. You can get a list of the raw metric received by time using a query like this one (note that no function is applied to the selected metric): FROM Metric SELECT aws.outposts.InstanceTypeCapacityUtilization WHERE collector.name = 'cloudwatch-metric-streams' Copy Remember that AWS fixes the maximum resolution (1 minute, 5 minutes, etc.) for every metric reported in AWS CloudWatch. AWS Metric Streams Operation You can see the state of the Metric Stream(s) in the Streams tab in the CloudWatch console. In particular, a Metric Stream can be in one of two states: running or stopped. Running: The stream is running correctly. Even if it's running, there may not be any metric data being streamed due to the configured filters. Stopped: The stream has been explicitly set to the halted state (not because of an error). This state is useful to temporarily stop the streaming of data without deleting the configuration. Errors in the Status Dashboard New Relic relies on the AWS Config service to collect additional metadata from resources in order to enrich metrics received via CloudWatch Metric Stream. Make sure AWS Config is enabled in your AWS Account, and ensure the linked Role has the following permission or inline policy created: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"config:BatchGetResourceConfig\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy",

Solution Verify your Infrastructure account's ARN Ensure that you are not collecting inventory information for the wrong ARN account. Verify that the ARN associated with your Infrastructure account is correct. Change the polling frequency The polling frequency determines how often New Relic gathers data from your cloud provider. By default, the polling frequency is set to the maximum frequency that is available for each service. If you reach your API rate limit, you may want to decrease the polling frequency. Filter your data You can set filters for each integration in order to specify which information you want captured. If you reach your API rate limit, you may want to filter your data. Review API usage To review the API usage for New Relic Infrastructure integrations with Amazon AWS: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS > Account status dashboard. Review the New Relic Insights dashboard, which appears automatically. The Insights dashboard includes a chart with your account's Amazon AWS API call count for the last month as well as the CloudWatch API calls (per AWS resource) for the last day. This information is the API usage for New Relic only. It does not include other AWS API or CloudWatch usage that may occur. For assistance determining which services may cause an increase in billing, get support at support.newrelic.com, or contact your New Relic account representative. Cause Infrastructure Amazon integrations leverage the AWS monitoring APIs to gather inventory data. AWS imposes hard rate limits on many of the AWS service-specific APIs consumed by New Relic Infrastructure integrations. Adding New Relic Amazon integrations will increase usage of the service-specific APIs and could impact how quickly you reach your rate limit. This may be caused by either of the following: Enabling Amazon integrations on several plugins for the same service Adding the incorrect Role ARN to your AWS integrations",

      "body": "New Relic's ECS integration reports and displays performance data from your Amazon ECS environment. Install overview Before you install our ECS integration, we recommend reviewing the requirements. During the install process: For EC2 launch type: The infrastructure agent (newrelic-infra) gets deployed onto an ECS cluster as a service using the daemon scheduling strategy. This deployment installs the infrastructure agent in all the container instances of the cluster. The infrastructure agent then monitors ECS and Docker containers. For Fargate launch type: The infrastructure agent (newrelic-infra) gets deployed as a sidecar in every task to monitor. The Amazon ECS Fargate documentation defines a sidecar as a way to move part of a service's core responsibility into a containerized module that is deployed alongside the core application. Install options: Install using AWS CloudFormation Install using automatic script Install manually Install using CloudFormation One install option is using AWS CloudFormation. We provide some CloudFormation templates that install the ECS integration onto your AWS account for both EC2 and Fargate launch types: To register the New Relic's ECS integration task, deploy this stack. Ensure you’re deploying the stack to your desired region(s). This stack creates the following resources: A secret that stores the license key. A policy to access the license key. An instance role to be used as an ECS task ExecutionRole, with access to the license key. For EC2 launch type: Registers the New Relic Infrastructure ECS integration task. Follow the additional instructions for your launch type: EC2 launch type Additional steps for EC2 launch type: To create a service that runs the task on every container instance, deploy this stack. Fargate launch type Additional steps for Fargate launch type: Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json Copy Add the newrelic-infra container in this task definition as a sidecar to the task definitions you want to monitor. In this example task, your application's containers replace the placeholder busybox container. Next steps: Wait a few minutes and then look for your data in the UI. Recommended: Install our ECS cloud integration, which gets you other ECS data, including information about clusters and services. See recommended alert conditions. Understand the AWS resources created by this process. Install with automatic script One install option is using our install script. To use the automatic install script: Download the ECS integration installer: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh Copy Add execute permissions to the installer: chmod +x newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh Copy Execute it with -h to see the documentation and requirements: ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -h Copy Check that your AWS profile points to the same region where your ECS cluster was created: $ aws configure get region us-east-1 $ aws ecs list-clusters YOUR_CLUSTER_ARNS arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:cluster/YOUR_CLUSTER Copy Execute the installer, specifying your license key and cluster name.

Important We have two ECS integrations: a cloud-based integration and an on-host integration. This document is about the on-host integration. Solution If your New Relic account had previously installed the infrastructure agent or an infrastructure on-host integration, your data should appear in the UI within a few minutes. If your account had not previously done either of those things before installing the on-host ECS integration, it may take tens of minutes for data to appear in the UI. In that case, we recommend waiting up to an hour before doing the following troubleshooting steps or contacting support. There are several options for troubleshooting no data appearing: Troubleshoot via the awscli tool (recommended when talking to New Relic technical support) Troubleshoot via the UI For information about stopped tasks, see Stopped tasks reasons. Troubleshoot via awscli When interacting with New Relic support, use this method and send the generated files with your support request: Retrieve the information related to the newrelic-infra service or the Fargate service that contains a task with a newrelic-infra sidecar: aws ecs describe-services --cluster YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME --service newrelic-infra > newrelic-infra-service.json Copy aws ecs describe-services --cluster YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME --service YOUR_FARGATE_SERVICE_WITH_NEW_RELIC_SIDECAR > newrelic-infra-sidecar-service.json Copy The failures attribute details any errors for the services. Under services is the status attribute. It says ACTIVE if the service has no issues. The desiredCount should match the runningCount. This is the number of tasks the service is handling. Because we use the daemon service type, there should be one task per container instance in your cluster. The pendingCount attribute should be zero, because all tasks should be running. Inspect the events attribute of services to check for issues with scheduling or starting the tasks. For example: if the service is unable to start tasks successfully, it will display a message like: { \"id\": \"5295a13c-34e6-41e1-96dd-8364c42cc7a9\", \"createdAt\": \"2020-04-06T15:28:18.298000+02:00\", \"message\": \"(service newrelic-ifnra) is unable to consistently start tasks successfully. For more information, see the Troubleshooting section of the Amazon ECS Developer Guide.\" } Copy In the same section, you can also see which tasks were started by the service from the events: { \"id\": \"1c0a6ce2-de2e-49b2-b0ac-6458a804d0f0\", \"createdAt\": \"2020-04-06T15:27:49.614000+02:00\", \"message\": \"(service fargate-fail) has started 1 tasks: (task YOUR_TASK_ID).\" } Copy Retrieve the information related to the task with this command: aws ecs describe-tasks --tasks YOUR_TASK_ID --cluster YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME > newrelic-infra-task.json Copy The desiredStatus and lastStatus should be RUNNING. If the task couldn't start normally, it will have a STOPPED status. Inspect the stopCode and stoppedReason. One reason example: a task that couldn't be started because the task execution role doesn't have the appropriate permissions to download the license-key-containing secret would have the following output: \"stopCode\": \"TaskFailedToStart\", \"stoppedAt\": \"2020-04-06T15:28:54.725000+02:00\", \"stoppedReason\": \"Fetching secret data from AWS Secrets Manager in region YOUR_AWS_REGION: secret arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:NewRelicLicenseKeySecret-Dh2dLkgV8VyJ-80RAHS-fail: AccessDeniedException: User: arn:aws:sts::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:assumed-role/NewRelicECSIntegration-Ne-NewRelicECSTaskExecution-1C0ODHVT4HDNT/8637b461f0f94d649e9247e2f14c3803 is not authorized to perform: secretsmanager:GetSecretValue on resource: arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:NewRelicLicenseKeySecret-Dh2dLkgV8VyJ-80RAHS-fail-DmLHfs status code: 400, request id: 9cf1881e-14d7-4257-b4a8-be9b56e09e3c\", \"stoppingAt\": \"2020-04-06T15:28:10.953000+02:00\", Copy If the task is running but you’re still not seeing data, generate verbose logs and examine them for errors. For details about reasons for stopped tasks, see Stopped tasks. Troubleshoot in the UI To use the UI to troubleshoot: Log in to your AWS Console and navigate to the EC2 Container Service section. Click on the cluster where you installed the New Relic ECS integration. On the Services tab, use the filter to search for the integration service. If you used the automatic install script, the name of the service will be newrelic-infra. If you are using Fargate, it will be the name of your monitored service. Once found, click on the name. The service page shows the Status of the service. It says ACTIVE if the service has no issues. On the same page, the Desired count should match the Running count. This is the number of tasks the service is handling. Because we use the daemon service type, there should be one task per container instance in your cluster. Pending count should be zero, because all tasks should be running. Inspect the Events tab to check for issues with scheduling or starting the tasks. In the Tasks tab of your service, you can inspect the running tasks and the stopped tasks by clicking on the Task status selector. Containers that failed to start are shown when you select the Stopped status. Click on a task to go to the task details page. Under Stopped reason, it displays a message explaining why the task was stopped. If the task is running but you’re still not seeing data, generate verbose logs and examine them for errors. For details about reasons for stopped tasks, see Stopped tasks. Reasons for stopped tasks In the AWS ECS troubleshooting documentation you can find information on common causes of errors related to running tasks and services. See below for details about some reasons for stopped tasks. Task stopped with reason: Fetching secret data from AWS Secrets Manager in region YOUR_AWS_REGION: secret arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:YOUR_SECRET_NAME: AccessDeniedException: User: arn:aws:sts::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:assumed-role/YOUR_ROLE_NAME is not authorized to perform: secretsmanager:GetSecretValue on resource: arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:YOUR_SECRET_NAME status code: 400, request id: 9cf1881e-14d7-4257-b4a8-be9b56e09e3c\" Copy This means that the IAM role specified using executionRoleArn in the task definition doesn't have access to the secret used for the NRIA_LICENSE_KEY. The execution role should have a policy attached that grants it access to read the secret. Get the execution role of your task: aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition newrelic-infra --output text --query taskDefinition.executionRoleArn Copy You can replace the --task-definition newrelic-infra with the name of your fargate task that includes the sidecar container. aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition YOUR_FARGATE_TASK_NAME --output text --query taskDefinition.executionRoleArn Copy List the policies attached to role: aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name YOUR_EXECUTION_ROLE_NAME Copy This should return 3 policies AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy, AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role and a third one that should grant read access to the license key. In the following example the policy it's named NewRelicLicenseKeySecretReadAccess. { \"AttachedPolicies\": [ { \"PolicyName\": \"AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy\", \"PolicyArn\": \"arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy\" }, { \"PolicyName\": \"AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role\", \"PolicyArn\": \"arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role\" }, { \"PolicyName\": \"YOUR_POLICY_NAME\", \"PolicyArn\": \"arn:aws:iam::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:policy/YOUR_POLICY_NAME\" } ] } Copy Retrieve the default policy version: aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:policy/YOUR_POLICY_NAME --version-id $(aws iam get-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:policy/YOUR_POLICY_NAME --output text --query Policy.DefaultVersionId) Copy This retrieves the policy permissions. There should be an entry for Actionsecretsmanager:GetSecretValue if you used AWS Secrets Manager to store your license key, or an entry for ssm:GetParametersif you used AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store: AWS Secrets Manager { \"PolicyVersion\": { \"Document\": { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Action\": \"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue\", \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:YOUR_SECRET_NAME\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\" } ] }, \"VersionId\": \"v1\", \"IsDefaultVersion\": true, \"CreateDate\": \"2020-03-31T13:47:07+00:00\" } } Copy AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Action\": \"ssm:GetParameters\", \"Resource\": [ \"arn:aws:ssm:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:parameter/YOUR_SECRET_NAME\" ], \"Effect\": \"Allow\" } ] } Copy",

Uninstall There are several uninstall options, depending on how you installed: Uninstall with CloudFormation Use automatic installer script Manual uninstall CloudFormation uninstall To uninstall the ECS integration using the CloudFormation templates: Go to the list of stacks in your AWS console. For each New Relic stack: Select the stack Click the delete button Click the delete stack button on the confirmation pop-up. Automatic uninstall To uninstall the ECS integration using the installer script: For EC2 launch type: run $ ./newrelic-infrastructure-ecs-installer.sh -u -c YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy For Fargate launch type: $ ./newrelic-infrastructure-ecs-installer.sh -f -u -c YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy You only need to execute the command once, regardless of the number of nodes in your cluster. The command will delete the AWS resources created during the install procedure. The installer provides a dry run mode that shows you the awscli commands that are going to be executed.

      "body": "New Relic's ECS integration reports and displays performance data from your Amazon ECS environment. Install overview Before you install our ECS integration, we recommend reviewing the requirements. During the install process: For EC2 launch type: The infrastructure agent (newrelic-infra) gets deployed onto an ECS cluster as a service using the daemon scheduling strategy. This deployment installs the infrastructure agent in all the container instances of the cluster. The infrastructure agent then monitors ECS and Docker containers. For Fargate launch type: The infrastructure agent (newrelic-infra) gets deployed as a sidecar in every task to monitor. The Amazon ECS Fargate documentation defines a sidecar as a way to move part of a service's core responsibility into a containerized module that is deployed alongside the core application. Install options: Install using AWS CloudFormation Install using automatic script Install manually Install using CloudFormation One install option is using AWS CloudFormation. We provide some CloudFormation templates that install the ECS integration onto your AWS account for both EC2 and Fargate launch types: To register the New Relic's ECS integration task, deploy this stack. Ensure you’re deploying the stack to your desired region(s). This stack creates the following resources: A secret that stores the license key. A policy to access the license key. An instance role to be used as an ECS task ExecutionRole, with access to the license key. For EC2 launch type: Registers the New Relic Infrastructure ECS integration task. Follow the additional instructions for your launch type: EC2 launch type Additional steps for EC2 launch type: To create a service that runs the task on every container instance, deploy this stack. Fargate launch type Additional steps for Fargate launch type: Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json Copy Add the newrelic-infra container in this task definition as a sidecar to the task definitions you want to monitor. In this example task, your application's containers replace the placeholder busybox container. Next steps: Wait a few minutes and then look for your data in the UI. Recommended: Install our ECS cloud integration, which gets you other ECS data, including information about clusters and services. See recommended alert conditions. Understand the AWS resources created by this process. Install with automatic script One install option is using our install script. To use the automatic install script: Download the ECS integration installer: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh Copy Add execute permissions to the installer: chmod +x newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh Copy Execute it with -h to see the documentation and requirements: ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -h Copy Check that your AWS profile points to the same region where your ECS cluster was created: $ aws configure get region us-east-1 $ aws ecs list-clusters YOUR_CLUSTER_ARNS arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:cluster/YOUR_CLUSTER Copy Execute the installer, specifying your license key and cluster name. EC2 launch type: ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -c YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME -l YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Fargate launch type: ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -fargate -c YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME -l YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Additional steps for Fargate launch type (not EC2 launch type): Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json Copy Add the single container in this task definition as a sidecar to the task definitions you want monitored.

      "body": "New Relic's ECS integration reports and displays performance data from your Amazon ECS environment. Install overview Before you install our ECS integration, we recommend reviewing the requirements. During the install process: For EC2 launch type: The infrastructure agent (newrelic-infra) gets deployed onto an ECS cluster as a service using the daemon scheduling strategy. This deployment installs the infrastructure agent in all the container instances of the cluster. The infrastructure agent then monitors ECS and Docker containers. For Fargate launch type: The infrastructure agent (newrelic-infra) gets deployed as a sidecar in every task to monitor. The Amazon ECS Fargate documentation defines a sidecar as a way to move part of a service's core responsibility into a containerized module that is deployed alongside the core application. Install options: Install using AWS CloudFormation Install using automatic script Install manually Install using CloudFormation One install option is using AWS CloudFormation. We provide some CloudFormation templates that install the ECS integration onto your AWS account for both EC2 and Fargate launch types: To register the New Relic's ECS integration task, deploy this stack. Ensure you’re deploying the stack to your desired region(s). This stack creates the following resources: A secret that stores the license key. A policy to access the license key. An instance role to be used as an ECS task ExecutionRole, with access to the license key. For EC2 launch type: Registers the New Relic Infrastructure ECS integration task. Follow the additional instructions for your launch type: EC2 launch type Additional steps for EC2 launch type: To create a service that runs the task on every container instance, deploy this stack. Fargate launch type Additional steps for Fargate launch type: Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json Copy Add the newrelic-infra container in this task definition as a sidecar to the task definitions you want to monitor.

      "body": "Problem You installed our on-host ECS integration and waited a few minutes, but your cluster is not showing in the explorer. Important We have two ECS integrations: a cloud-based integration and an on-host integration. This document is about the on-host integration. Solution If your New Relic account had previously installed the infrastructure agent or an infrastructure on-host integration, your data should appear in the UI within a few minutes. If your account had not previously done either of those things before installing the on-host ECS integration, it may take tens of minutes for data to appear in the UI. In that case, we recommend waiting up to an hour before doing the following troubleshooting steps or contacting support. There are several options for troubleshooting no data appearing: Troubleshoot via the awscli tool (recommended when talking to New Relic technical support) Troubleshoot via the UI For information about stopped tasks, see Stopped tasks reasons. Troubleshoot via awscli When interacting with New Relic support, use this method and send the generated files with your support request: Retrieve the information related to the newrelic-infra service or the Fargate service that contains a task with a newrelic-infra sidecar: aws ecs describe-services --cluster YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME --service newrelic-infra > newrelic-infra-service.json Copy aws ecs describe-services --cluster YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME --service YOUR_FARGATE_SERVICE_WITH_NEW_RELIC_SIDECAR > newrelic-infra-sidecar-service.json Copy The failures attribute details any errors for the services. Under services is the status attribute. It says ACTIVE if the service has no issues. The desiredCount should match the runningCount. This is the number of tasks the service is handling. Because we use the daemon service type, there should be one task per container instance in your cluster. The pendingCount attribute should be zero, because all tasks should be running. Inspect the events attribute of services to check for issues with scheduling or starting the tasks. For example: if the service is unable to start tasks successfully, it will display a message like: { \"id\": \"5295a13c-34e6-41e1-96dd-8364c42cc7a9\", \"createdAt\": \"2020-04-06T15:28:18.298000+02:00\", \"message\": \"(service newrelic-ifnra) is unable to consistently start tasks successfully. For more information, see the Troubleshooting section of the Amazon ECS Developer Guide.\" } Copy In the same section, you can also see which tasks were started by the service from the events: { \"id\": \"1c0a6ce2-de2e-49b2-b0ac-6458a804d0f0\", \"createdAt\": \"2020-04-06T15:27:49.614000+02:00\", \"message\": \"(service fargate-fail) has started 1 tasks: (task YOUR_TASK_ID).\" } Copy Retrieve the information related to the task with this command: aws ecs describe-tasks --tasks YOUR_TASK_ID --cluster YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME > newrelic-infra-task.json Copy The desiredStatus and lastStatus should be RUNNING. If the task couldn't start normally, it will have a STOPPED status. Inspect the stopCode and stoppedReason. One reason example: a task that couldn't be started because the task execution role doesn't have the appropriate permissions to download the license-key-containing secret would have the following output: \"stopCode\": \"TaskFailedToStart\", \"stoppedAt\": \"2020-04-06T15:28:54.725000+02:00\", \"stoppedReason\": \"Fetching secret data from AWS Secrets Manager in region YOUR_AWS_REGION: secret arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:NewRelicLicenseKeySecret-Dh2dLkgV8VyJ-80RAHS-fail: AccessDeniedException: User: arn:aws:sts::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:assumed-role/NewRelicECSIntegration-Ne-NewRelicECSTaskExecution-1C0ODHVT4HDNT/8637b461f0f94d649e9247e2f14c3803 is not authorized to perform: secretsmanager:GetSecretValue on resource: arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:NewRelicLicenseKeySecret-Dh2dLkgV8VyJ-80RAHS-fail-DmLHfs status code: 400, request id: 9cf1881e-14d7-4257-b4a8-be9b56e09e3c\", \"stoppingAt\": \"2020-04-06T15:28:10.953000+02:00\", Copy If the task is running but you’re still not seeing data, generate verbose logs and examine them for errors. For details about reasons for stopped tasks, see Stopped tasks. Troubleshoot in the UI To use the UI to troubleshoot: Log in to your AWS Console and navigate to the EC2 Container Service section. Click on the cluster where you installed the New Relic ECS integration. On the Services tab, use the filter to search for the integration service. If you used the automatic install script, the name of the service will be newrelic-infra. If you are using Fargate, it will be the name of your monitored service. Once found, click on the name. The service page shows the Status of the service. It says ACTIVE if the service has no issues. On the same page, the Desired count should match the Running count. This is the number of tasks the service is handling. Because we use the daemon service type, there should be one task per container instance in your cluster. Pending count should be zero, because all tasks should be running. Inspect the Events tab to check for issues with scheduling or starting the tasks. In the Tasks tab of your service, you can inspect the running tasks and the stopped tasks by clicking on the Task status selector. Containers that failed to start are shown when you select the Stopped status. Click on a task to go to the task details page. Under Stopped reason, it displays a message explaining why the task was stopped. If the task is running but you’re still not seeing data, generate verbose logs and examine them for errors. For details about reasons for stopped tasks, see Stopped tasks. Reasons for stopped tasks In the AWS ECS troubleshooting documentation you can find information on common causes of errors related to running tasks and services. See below for details about some reasons for stopped tasks. Task stopped with reason: Fetching secret data from AWS Secrets Manager in region YOUR_AWS_REGION: secret arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:YOUR_SECRET_NAME: AccessDeniedException: User: arn:aws:sts::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:assumed-role/YOUR_ROLE_NAME is not authorized to perform: secretsmanager:GetSecretValue on resource: arn:aws:secretsmanager:YOUR_AWS_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:YOUR_SECRET_NAME status code: 400, request id: 9cf1881e-14d7-4257-b4a8-be9b56e09e3c\" Copy This means that the IAM role specified using executionRoleArn in the task definition doesn't have access to the secret used for the NRIA_LICENSE_KEY. The execution role should have a policy attached that grants it access to read the secret. Get the execution role of your task: aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition newrelic-infra --output text --query taskDefinition.executionRoleArn Copy You can replace the --task-definition newrelic-infra with the name of your fargate task that includes the sidecar container. aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition YOUR_FARGATE_TASK_NAME --output text --query taskDefinition.executionRoleArn Copy List the policies attached to role: aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name YOUR_EXECUTION_ROLE_NAME Copy This should return 3 policies AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy, AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role and a third one that should grant read access to the license key. In the following example the policy it's named NewRelicLicenseKeySecretReadAccess. { \"AttachedPolicies\": [ { \"PolicyName\": \"AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy\", \"PolicyArn\": \"arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy\" }, { \"PolicyName\": \"AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role\", \"PolicyArn\": \"arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role\" }, { \"PolicyName\": \"YOUR_POLICY_NAME\", \"PolicyArn\": \"arn:aws:iam::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:policy/YOUR_POLICY_NAME\" } ] } Copy Retrieve the default policy version: aws iam get-policy-version --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:policy/YOUR_POLICY_NAME --version-id $(aws iam get-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:policy/YOUR_POLICY_NAME --output text --query Policy.DefaultVersionId) Copy This retrieves the policy permissions.

      "body": "New Relic's ECS integration reports and displays performance data from your Amazon ECS environment. Install overview Before you install our ECS integration, we recommend reviewing the requirements. During the install process: For EC2 launch type: The infrastructure agent (newrelic-infra) gets deployed onto an ECS cluster as a service using the daemon scheduling strategy. This deployment installs the infrastructure agent in all the container instances of the cluster. The infrastructure agent then monitors ECS and Docker containers. For Fargate launch type: The infrastructure agent (newrelic-infra) gets deployed as a sidecar in every task to monitor. The Amazon ECS Fargate documentation defines a sidecar as a way to move part of a service's core responsibility into a containerized module that is deployed alongside the core application. Install options: Install using AWS CloudFormation Install using automatic script Install manually Install using CloudFormation One install option is using AWS CloudFormation. We provide some CloudFormation templates that install the ECS integration onto your AWS account for both EC2 and Fargate launch types: To register the New Relic's ECS integration task, deploy this stack. Ensure you’re deploying the stack to your desired region(s). This stack creates the following resources: A secret that stores the license key. A policy to access the license key. An instance role to be used as an ECS task ExecutionRole, with access to the license key. For EC2 launch type: Registers the New Relic Infrastructure ECS integration task. Follow the additional instructions for your launch type: EC2 launch type Additional steps for EC2 launch type: To create a service that runs the task on every container instance, deploy this stack. Fargate launch type Additional steps for Fargate launch type: Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json Copy Add the newrelic-infra container in this task definition as a sidecar to the task definitions you want to monitor. In this example task, your application's containers replace the placeholder busybox container. Next steps: Wait a few minutes and then look for your data in the UI. Recommended: Install our ECS cloud integration, which gets you other ECS data, including information about clusters and services. See recommended alert conditions. Understand the AWS resources created by this process. Install with automatic script One install option is using our install script. To use the automatic install script: Download the ECS integration installer: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh Copy Add execute permissions to the installer: chmod +x newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh Copy Execute it with -h to see the documentation and requirements: ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -h Copy Check that your AWS profile points to the same region where your ECS cluster was created: $ aws configure get region us-east-1 $ aws ecs list-clusters YOUR_CLUSTER_ARNS arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:cluster/YOUR_CLUSTER Copy Execute the installer, specifying your license key and cluster name. EC2 launch type: ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -c YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME -l YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Fargate launch type: ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -fargate -c YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME -l YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Additional steps for Fargate launch type (not EC2 launch type): Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json Copy Add the single container in this task definition as a sidecar to the task definitions you want monitored. Next steps: Wait a few minutes and then look for your data in the UI. Recommended: Install our ECS cloud integration, which gets you other ECS data, including information about clusters and services. See recommended alert conditions. Understand the AWS resources created by this process. Manual install One install option is to manually do the steps that are done by the automatic installer script.

Understand the AWS resources created by this process. AWS resources created When you install the ECS integration using default/recommended values, it does the following in AWS: Creates Systems Manager (SSM) parameter /newrelic-infra/ecs/license-key. This system parameter contains the New Relic license key. Creates IAM policy NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess, which enables access to the SSM parameter with the license key. Creates IAM role NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole used as the task execution role. Policies attached to the role: NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess (created by the installer).

      "body": "Problem When troubleshooting the on-host ECS integration, you can generate verbose logs for a few minutes to find and investigate errors. This can be useful for conducting your own troubleshooting or when providing information to New Relic support. Verbose logging generates a lot of data very quickly. When finished generating logs, be sure to set verbose: 0 to reduce disk space consumption. You can automate this process by using the newrelic-infra-ctl command. For more information, see Troubleshooting a running agent. Solution Generating verbose log files requires editing your task definition file. For a sample config file that includes all applicable settings, see Infrastructure configuration settings. You have several options for implementing verbose logs: Change the task definition environment variable and do a task restart For EC2 launch type: Retrieve logs via SSH Forward to CloudWatch and download with awscli Run a command from the running container Using task definition environment variable To enable verbose logs by changing the environment variable and doing a task restart: Edit your task definition. Change the value of NRIA_VERBOSE from 0 to: 1 for always-on verbose logs 2 for smart logging 3 for sending to New Relic Read more about these options. Save your task definition. Update your service to use the newly registered task definition. If you chose NRIA_VERBOSE=3 and you're not sending the logs directly to New Relic, you have two options for viewing and downloading the logs: For EC2 launch type: you can retrieve the logs via SSH, or Forward logs to CloudWatch Return your settings to default: Disable verbose logging by editing your task definition and setting NRIA_VERBOSE to 0. Save your task definition. Update your service to the latest version of your task. Examine the log file for errors. If you need to send your log file to New Relic support: Include the line in your log file that contains the ECS integration version: New Relic ECS integration version X.YY.ZZZ Copy Attach the log file to your support ticket, along with your task definition .yml file. Retrieve logs via SSH (EC2 launch type only) To get logs via SSH: Edit your task definition. Change the value of NRIA_VERBOSE from 0 to: 1 for always-on verbose logs 2 for smart logging 3 for sending to New Relic Read more about these options. SSH into one of your container instances. Find the container ID of the New Relic integration container, by running the command docker ps -a. The name of the container should be nri-ecs. Save the logs from the container with the command docker logs NRI_ECS_CONTAINER_ID > logs.txt. Leave the command running for about three minutes to generate sufficient logging data. Continue with the instructions in the enable verbose logs section. Forward logs to CloudWatch and download them with awscli To get logs via CloudWatch: Edit your task definition. Change the value of NRIA_VERBOSE from 0 to: 1 for always-on verbose logs 2 for smart logging 3 for sending to New Relic Read more about these options. We use a CloudWatch log group called /newrelic-infra/ecs to forward the logs to. To see if it already exists, run: aws logs describe-log-groups --log-group-name-prefix /newrelic-infra/ecs Copy If a log group exists with that prefix, you'll get this output: { \"logGroups\": [ { \"logGroupName\": \"/newrelic-infra/ecs\", \"creationTime\": 1585828615225, \"metricFilterCount\": 0, \"arn\": \"arn:aws:logs:YOUR_REGION:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:log-group:/newrelic-infra/ecs:*\", \"storedBytes\": 122539356 } ] } Copy Because this command matches log groups with prefixes, ensure the log group name returned is exactly /newrelic-infra/ecs. If the log group doesn't exist, the output will be: { \"logGroups\": [] } Copy If the log group doesn't exist, create it by running: aws logs create-log-group --log-group-name /newrelic-infra/ecs Copy Edit your task definition. In the container definition for the newrelic-infra container, add the following logConfiguration: \"logConfiguration\": { \"logDriver\": \"awslogs\", \"options\": { \"awslogs-group\": \"/newrelic-infra/ecs\", \"awslogs-region\": \"AWS_REGION_OF_YOUR_CLUSTER\", \"awslogs-stream-prefix\": \"verbose\" } } Copy Register the new task version and update your service. Next you'll look for the relevant log stream. If you have multiple instances of the task running, they'll all send their logs to the same log group but each will have its own log stream. Log streams names follow the structure AWSLOGS_STREAM_PREFIX/TASK_FAMILY_NAME/TASK_ID. In this case, it will be verbose/newrelic-infra/TASK_ID. To get all the log streams for a given log group, run this command: aws logs describe-log-streams --log-group-name /newrelic-infra/ecs Copy The following is an example output of a log group with two streams: { \"logStreams\": [ { \"logStreamName\": \"verbose/newrelic-infra/9dfb28114e40415ebc399ec1e53a21b7\", \"creationTime\": 1586166741197, \"firstEventTimestamp\": 1586166742030, \"lastEventTimestamp\": 1586173933472, \"lastIngestionTime\": 1586175101220, \"uploadSequenceToken\": \"49599989655680038369205623273330095416487086853777112338\", \"arn\": \"arn:aws:logs:AWS_REGION_OF_YOUR_CLUSTER:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:log-group:/newrelic-infra/ecs:log-stream:verbose/newrelic-infra/9dfb28114e40415ebc399ec1e53a21b7\", \"storedBytes\": 0 }, { \"logStreamName\": \"verbose/newrelic-infra/f6ce0be416804bc4bfa658da5514eb00\", \"creationTime\": 1586166745643, \"firstEventTimestamp\": 1586166746491, \"lastEventTimestamp\": 1586173037927, \"lastIngestionTime\": 1586175100660, \"uploadSequenceToken\": \"49605664273821671319096446647846424799651902350804230514\", \"arn\": \"arn:aws:logs:AWS_REGION_OF_YOUR_CLUSTER:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:log-group:/newrelic-infra/ecs:log-stream:verbose/newrelic-infra/f6ce0be416804bc4bfa658da5514eb00\", \"storedBytes\": 0 } ] } Copy From the previous list of log streams, identify the one with the task ID for which you want to retrieve the logs and use the logStreamName in this command: aws logs get-log-events --log-group-name /newrelic-infra/ecs --log-stream-name \"LOG_STREAM_NAME\" --output text > logs.txt Copy Continue with the enable verbose logs instructions. From running container To enable verbose logs by running a command from the running container: SSH into one of your container instances. Find the container ID of the New Relic integration container by running the command docker ps -a. The name of the container should be nri-ecs. Enable verbose logs for a limited period of time by using newrelic-infra-ctl. Run the command: docker exec INTEGRATION_CONTAINER_ID /usr/bin/newrelic-infra-ctl Copy For more details, see Troubleshoot the agent. Save the logs from the container with the command docker logs INTEGRATION_CONTAINER_ID > logs.txt Copy Leave the command running for about three minutes to generate sufficient logging data. Examine the log file for errors. If you need to send your log file to New Relic support: Include the line in your log file that contains the ECS integration version: New Relic ECS integration version X.YY.ZZZ Copy Attach the log file to your support ticket, along with your task definition .yml file.",

      "body": "New Relic's ECS integration reports and displays performance data from your Amazon ECS environment. Install overview Before you install our ECS integration, we recommend reviewing the requirements. During the install process: For EC2 launch type: The infrastructure agent (newrelic-infra) gets deployed onto an ECS cluster as a service using the daemon scheduling strategy. This deployment installs the infrastructure agent in all the container instances of the cluster. The infrastructure agent then monitors ECS and Docker containers. For Fargate launch type: The infrastructure agent (newrelic-infra) gets deployed as a sidecar in every task to monitor. The Amazon ECS Fargate documentation defines a sidecar as a way to move part of a service's core responsibility into a containerized module that is deployed alongside the core application. Install options: Install using AWS CloudFormation Install using automatic script Install manually Install using CloudFormation One install option is using AWS CloudFormation. We provide some CloudFormation templates that install the ECS integration onto your AWS account for both EC2 and Fargate launch types: To register the New Relic's ECS integration task, deploy this stack. Ensure you’re deploying the stack to your desired region(s). This stack creates the following resources: A secret that stores the license key. A policy to access the license key. An instance role to be used as an ECS task ExecutionRole, with access to the license key. For EC2 launch type: Registers the New Relic Infrastructure ECS integration task. Follow the additional instructions for your launch type: EC2 launch type Additional steps for EC2 launch type: To create a service that runs the task on every container instance, deploy this stack. Fargate launch type Additional steps for Fargate launch type: Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json Copy Add the newrelic-infra container in this task definition as a sidecar to the task definitions you want to monitor. In this example task, your application's containers replace the placeholder busybox container. Next steps: Wait a few minutes and then look for your data in the UI. Recommended: Install our ECS cloud integration, which gets you other ECS data, including information about clusters and services. See recommended alert conditions. Understand the AWS resources created by this process. Install with automatic script One install option is using our install script. To use the automatic install script: Download the ECS integration installer: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh Copy Add execute permissions to the installer: chmod +x newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh Copy Execute it with -h to see the documentation and requirements: ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -h Copy Check that your AWS profile points to the same region where your ECS cluster was created: $ aws configure get region us-east-1 $ aws ecs list-clusters YOUR_CLUSTER_ARNS arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:cluster/YOUR_CLUSTER Copy Execute the installer, specifying your license key and cluster name. EC2 launch type: ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -c YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME -l YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Fargate launch type: ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -fargate -c YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME -l YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Additional steps for Fargate launch type (not EC2 launch type): Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json Copy Add the single container in this task definition as a sidecar to the task definitions you want monitored. Next steps: Wait a few minutes and then look for your data in the UI. Recommended: Install our ECS cloud integration, which gets you other ECS data, including information about clusters and services. See recommended alert conditions. Understand the AWS resources created by this process. Manual install One install option is to manually do the steps that are done by the automatic installer script. We will describe how this is done using the awscli tool: Check that your AWS profile points to the same region where your ECS cluster was created: $ aws configure get region us-east-1 $ aws ecs list-clusters YOUR_CLUSTER_ARNS arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:cluster/YOUR_CLUSTER Copy Save your New Relic license key as a Systems Manager (SSM) parameter: aws ssm put-parameter \\ --name \"/newrelic-infra/ecs/license-key\" \\ --type SecureString \\ --description 'New Relic license key for ECS monitoring' \\ --value \"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Create an IAM policy to access the license key parameter: aws iam create-policy \\ --policy-name \"NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess\" \\ --policy-document \"{\"Version\"\\\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Action\":[\"ssm:GetParameters\"],\"Resource\":[\"ARN_OF_LICENSE_KEY_PARAMETER\"]}]}\" --description \"Provides read access to the New Relic SSM license key parameter\" Copy Create an IAM role to be used as the task execution role: aws iam create-role \\ --role-name \"NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole\" \\ --assume-role-policy-document '{\"Version\":\"2008-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Sid\":\"\",\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":{\"Service\":\"ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com\"},\"Action\":\"sts:AssumeRole\"}]}' \\ --description \"ECS task execution role for New Relic infrastructure\" Copy Attach the policies NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess, AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role, and AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy to the role: aws iam attach-role-policy \\ --role-name \"NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole\" \\ --policy-arn \"POLICY_ARN\" Copy Choose your launch type for more instructions: EC2 launch type Additional steps for EC2 launch type: Download the New Relic ECS integration task definition template file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-ec2-latest.json Copy Replace the task execution role in the template file with the newly created role: \"executionRoleArn\": \"NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole\", Copy Replace the valueFrom attribute of the secret with the name of the Systems Manager parameter: secrets\": [ { \"valueFrom\": \"/newrelic-infra/ecs/license-key\", \"name\": \"NRIA_LICENSE_KEY\" } ], Copy Register the task definition file: aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://newrelic-infra-ecs-ec2-latest.json Copy Create a service with the daemon scheduling strategy for the registered task: aws ecs create-service --cluster \"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" --service-name \"newrelic-infra\" --task-definition \"newrelic-infra\" --scheduling-strategy DAEMON Copy Fargate launch type Additional steps for the Fargate launch type: Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json Copy Add the newrelic-infra container in this task definition as a sidecar to the task definitions you want to monitor. In this example task, your application's containers replace the placeholder busybox container. Next steps: Wait a few minutes and then look for your data in the UI. Recommended: Install our ECS cloud integration, a separate integration which gets you supplementary ECS data, including information about clusters and services. See recommended alert conditions. Understand the AWS resources created by this process. AWS resources created When you install the ECS integration using default/recommended values, it does the following in AWS: Creates Systems Manager (SSM) parameter /newrelic-infra/ecs/license-key. This system parameter contains the New Relic license key. Creates IAM policy NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess, which enables access to the SSM parameter with the license key. Creates IAM role NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole used as the task execution role. Policies attached to the role: NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess (created by the installer). AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy For EC2 launch type, this is also done: Registers the newrelic-infra ECS task definition. Creates the service newrelic-infra for the registered task using a daemon scheduling strategy.",

In this example task, your application's containers replace the placeholder busybox container. Next steps: Wait a few minutes and then look for your data in the UI. Recommended: Install our ECS cloud integration, which gets you other ECS data, including information about clusters and services. See recommended alert conditions. Understand the AWS resources created by this process. Install with automatic script One install option is using our install script. To use the automatic install script: Download the ECS integration installer: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh Copy Add execute permissions to the installer: chmod +x newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh Copy Execute it with -h to see the documentation and requirements: ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -h Copy Check that your AWS profile points to the same region where your ECS cluster was created: $ aws configure get region us-east-1 $ aws ecs list-clusters YOUR_CLUSTER_ARNS arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:cluster/YOUR_CLUSTER Copy Execute the installer, specifying your license key and cluster name. EC2 launch type: ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -c YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME -l YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Fargate launch type: ./newrelic-infra-ecs-installer.sh -fargate -c YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME -l YOUR_LICENSE_KEY Copy Additional steps for Fargate launch type (not EC2 launch type): Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json Copy Add the single container in this task definition as a sidecar to the task definitions you want monitored. Next steps: Wait a few minutes and then look for your data in the UI. Recommended: Install our ECS cloud integration, which gets you other ECS data, including information about clusters and services. See recommended alert conditions. Understand the AWS resources created by this process. Manual install One install option is to manually do the steps that are done by the automatic installer script. We will describe how this is done using the awscli tool: Check that your AWS profile points to the same region where your ECS cluster was created: $ aws configure get region us-east-1 $ aws ecs list-clusters YOUR_CLUSTER_ARNS arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT:cluster/YOUR_CLUSTER Copy Save your New Relic license key as a Systems Manager (SSM) parameter: aws ssm put-parameter \\ --name \"/newrelic-infra/ecs/license-key\" \\ --type SecureString \\ --description 'New Relic license key for ECS monitoring' \\ --value \"NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY\" Copy Create an IAM policy to access the license key parameter: aws iam create-policy \\ --policy-name \"NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess\" \\ --policy-document \"{\"Version\"\\\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Action\":[\"ssm:GetParameters\"],\"Resource\":[\"ARN_OF_LICENSE_KEY_PARAMETER\"]}]}\" --description \"Provides read access to the New Relic SSM license key parameter\" Copy Create an IAM role to be used as the task execution role: aws iam create-role \\ --role-name \"NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole\" \\ --assume-role-policy-document '{\"Version\":\"2008-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Sid\":\"\",\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Principal\":{\"Service\":\"ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com\"},\"Action\":\"sts:AssumeRole\"}]}' \\ --description \"ECS task execution role for New Relic infrastructure\" Copy Attach the policies NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess, AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role, and AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy to the role: aws iam attach-role-policy \\ --role-name \"NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole\" \\ --policy-arn \"POLICY_ARN\" Copy Choose your launch type for more instructions: EC2 launch type Additional steps for EC2 launch type: Download the New Relic ECS integration task definition template file: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-ec2-latest.json Copy Replace the task execution role in the template file with the newly created role: \"executionRoleArn\": \"NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole\", Copy Replace the valueFrom attribute of the secret with the name of the Systems Manager parameter: secrets\": [ { \"valueFrom\": \"/newrelic-infra/ecs/license-key\", \"name\": \"NRIA_LICENSE_KEY\" } ], Copy Register the task definition file: aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://newrelic-infra-ecs-ec2-latest.json Copy Create a service with the daemon scheduling strategy for the registered task: aws ecs create-service --cluster \"YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME\" --service-name \"newrelic-infra\" --task-definition \"newrelic-infra\" --scheduling-strategy DAEMON Copy Fargate launch type Additional steps for the Fargate launch type: Download the task definition example with the sidecar container to be deployed: curl -O https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/integrations/ecs/newrelic-infra-ecs-fargate-example-latest.json Copy Add the newrelic-infra container in this task definition as a sidecar to the task definitions you want to monitor. In this example task, your application's containers replace the placeholder busybox container. Next steps: Wait a few minutes and then look for your data in the UI. Recommended: Install our ECS cloud integration, a separate integration which gets you supplementary ECS data, including information about clusters and services. See recommended alert conditions. Understand the AWS resources created by this process. AWS resources created When you install the ECS integration using default/recommended values, it does the following in AWS: Creates Systems Manager (SSM) parameter /newrelic-infra/ecs/license-key. This system parameter contains the New Relic license key. Creates IAM policy NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess, which enables access to the SSM parameter with the license key. Creates IAM role NewRelicECSTaskExecutionRole used as the task execution role. Policies attached to the role: NewRelicSSMLicenseKeyReadAccess (created by the installer). AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy For EC2 launch type, this is also done: Registers the newrelic-infra ECS task definition. Creates the service newrelic-infra for the registered task using a daemon scheduling strategy.",

Default polling information for the GCP Bigtable integration: New Relic polling interval: 5 minutes Find and use data To find your integration data, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select the integration. Data is attached to the following event types: Entity Event Type Provider Cluster GcpBigtableClusterSample GcpBigtableCluster Table GcpBigtableTableSample GcpBigtableTable For more on how to use your data, see Understand and use integration data. Metric data This integration collects GCP Bigtable data for Cluster and Table. Bigtable Cluster data Metric Unit Description cluster.CpuLoad Count CPU load of a cluster. cluster.CpuLoadHottestNode Count CPU load of the busiest node in a cluster. cluster.DiskLoad Count Utilization of HDD disks in a cluster. cluster.Node Count Number of nodes in a cluster. cluster.StorageUtilization Count Storage used as a fraction of total storage capacity. disk.BytesUsed Bytes Amount of compressed data for tables stored in a cluster. disk.StorageCapacity Bytes Capacity of compressed data for tables that can be stored in a cluster. Bigtable Table data Metric Unit Description replication.Latency Milliseconds Distribution of replication request latencies for a table. Includes only requests that have been received by the destination cluster. replication.MaxDelay Seconds Upper bound for replication delay between clusters of a table. Indicates the time frame during which latency information may not be accurate. server.Error Count Number of server requests for a table that failed with an error. server.Latencies Milliseconds Distribution of server request latencies for a table, measured when calls reach Cloud Bigtable. server.ModifiedRows Count Number of rows modified by server requests for a table. server.MultiClusterFailovers Count Number of failovers during multi-cluster requests. server.ReceivedBytes Bytes Number of uncompressed bytes of request data received by servers for a table. server.Request Count Number of server requests for a table. server.ReturnedRows Count Number of rows returned by server requests for a table. server.SentBytes Bytes Number of uncompressed bytes of response data sent by servers for a table. table.BytesUsed Bytes Amount of compressed data stored in a table.",

      "body": "To start receiving Google Cloud Platform (GCP) data with New Relic GCP integrations, connect your Google project to New Relic infrastructure monitoring. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Requirements These are the requirements for the authorization: GCP integration requirements Comments Monitoring In the GCP project API & Services Library settings, you must enable Google Stackdriver Monitoring API. Authorization For service account authorization (recommended): A user with Project IAM Admin role is needed to add the service account ID as a member in your GCP project. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the service account must have the Project Viewer role and the Service Usage Consumer role or, alternatively, a custom role. For user account authorization: The New Relic user that will integrate the GCP project must have a Google account and must be able to view the GCP project that New Relic will monitor. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the user must have the Project Viewer role. Please note that this authorization method will not allow New Relic to collect labels and other inventory attributes that can be useful for narrowing down your NRQL queries, dashboards and alerts. You can migrate the authorization method from user account to service account from the Manage services link in New Relic's user interface. Project name As part of the online setup process, you must identify Project name of the projects you want to monitor with New Relic. The UI workflow automatically lists active projects you can select. Permissions (only for user account authorization) New Relic requires a specific set of read-only permissions exclusively; this means that, for certain integrations, only partial inventory data will be available. Keep in mind that New Relic doesn't inherit your Google account's permissions and therefore is not authorized to perform any changes in the project. For more information about the API permissions that New Relic uses, see the Google documentation about scopes. Authorization options Integrating your GCP project with New Relic requires you to authorize New Relic to fetch monitoring data from your GCP project. You can choose between two authorization methods: Service accounts or User accounts. Service account (recommended) The service account authorization is recommended. If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a service account, we will call your GCP project APIs using a service account ID and its associated public/private key pair. New Relic manages a specific Google service account for your New Relic account; you do not need to create it or manage the associated private key. Just add the service account ID as a member with viewing permissions in your project. If your organization uses a domain restriction constraint, you will have to update the policy to allow the New Relic domain, C02x1gp26. This authorization method is recommended, especially if your GCP project is managed by a team. It also guarantees that New Relic will collect labels and inventory attributes whenever possible. User account If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a user account, New Relic will access your GCP project monitoring data on behalf of a particular Google user. The authorization process is achieved through an OAuth workflow, which redirects you from the New Relic UI to a Google authorization interface. However, since the authorization is linked to a particular Google user, this method is not recommended for GCP projects that are managed by large teams. Connect GCP to New Relic infrastructure monitoring To connect your Google account to New Relic with user account authorization: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. At the top of Infrastructure's Google Cloud Services integrations page, select Add a GCP account. Choose Authorization Method: Select either Authorize a Service Account or Authorize a User Account, and follow the instructions in the UI to authorize New Relic. Add projects: Select the projects that you want New Relic to receive data from. Select services: From the list of available services for your GCP account, select the individual services you want New Relic to receive data from, or select all of the services. Tip These services will be enabled for all of the projects that you selected in the previous step. Once the setup process is finished, you can fine-tune the services that you want monitored for each project individually. To complete the setup process, select Finish. If you see API authentication errors, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Explore app data in New Relic After you authorize New Relic to integrate one or more of your Google project's services, New Relic starts monitoring your GCP data at regular polling intervals. After a few minutes, data will appear in the New Relic UI. To find and use your data, including links to dashboards and alert settings, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. Link multiple Google projects For your convenience, the setup process allows you to select more than one project at a time. After the first setup, if you need to monitor additional GCP projects with New Relic, you can repeat the procedure to connect your GCP services as many times as you need. Unlink your GCP integrations You can disable any of your GCP integrations any time and still keep your Google project connected to New Relic. If you want to... Do this Disable a GCP service monitoring To disconnect individual GCP services but keep the integration with New Relic for other GCP services in your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, make changes to the checkbox options for available services and select Save changes. Unlink your project monitoring To uninstall all of your GCP services completely from New Relic Integrations, unlink your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, select Unlink account and select Save changes. Clean your GCP Projects after unlinking New Relic To clean your GCP project after unlinking, follow these steps if you were using a service account: Open the GCP IAM Console. Select the project you want to unlink from New Relic and click Open. Select the service account that is used by New Relic. Click the Remove icon. Or follow these steps if you were using a user account: Open your Google user account settings. Open the Apps with access to your account section. Choose New Relic application. Choose Remove Access.",

      "body": "To start receiving Google Cloud Platform (GCP) data with New Relic GCP integrations, connect your Google project to New Relic infrastructure monitoring. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Requirements These are the requirements for the authorization: GCP integration requirements Comments Monitoring In the GCP project API & Services Library settings, you must enable Google Stackdriver Monitoring API. Authorization For service account authorization (recommended): A user with Project IAM Admin role is needed to add the service account ID as a member in your GCP project. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the service account must have the Project Viewer role and the Service Usage Consumer role or, alternatively, a custom role. For user account authorization: The New Relic user that will integrate the GCP project must have a Google account and must be able to view the GCP project that New Relic will monitor. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the user must have the Project Viewer role. Please note that this authorization method will not allow New Relic to collect labels and other inventory attributes that can be useful for narrowing down your NRQL queries, dashboards and alerts. You can migrate the authorization method from user account to service account from the Manage services link in New Relic's user interface. Project name As part of the online setup process, you must identify Project name of the projects you want to monitor with New Relic. The UI workflow automatically lists active projects you can select. Permissions (only for user account authorization) New Relic requires a specific set of read-only permissions exclusively; this means that, for certain integrations, only partial inventory data will be available. Keep in mind that New Relic doesn't inherit your Google account's permissions and therefore is not authorized to perform any changes in the project. For more information about the API permissions that New Relic uses, see the Google documentation about scopes. Authorization options Integrating your GCP project with New Relic requires you to authorize New Relic to fetch monitoring data from your GCP project. You can choose between two authorization methods: Service accounts or User accounts. Service account (recommended) The service account authorization is recommended. If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a service account, we will call your GCP project APIs using a service account ID and its associated public/private key pair. New Relic manages a specific Google service account for your New Relic account; you do not need to create it or manage the associated private key. Just add the service account ID as a member with viewing permissions in your project. If your organization uses a domain restriction constraint, you will have to update the policy to allow the New Relic domain, C02x1gp26. This authorization method is recommended, especially if your GCP project is managed by a team. It also guarantees that New Relic will collect labels and inventory attributes whenever possible. User account If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a user account, New Relic will access your GCP project monitoring data on behalf of a particular Google user. The authorization process is achieved through an OAuth workflow, which redirects you from the New Relic UI to a Google authorization interface. However, since the authorization is linked to a particular Google user, this method is not recommended for GCP projects that are managed by large teams. Connect GCP to New Relic infrastructure monitoring To connect your Google account to New Relic with user account authorization: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. At the top of Infrastructure's Google Cloud Services integrations page, select Add a GCP account. Choose Authorization Method: Select either Authorize a Service Account or Authorize a User Account, and follow the instructions in the UI to authorize New Relic. Add projects: Select the projects that you want New Relic to receive data from. Select services: From the list of available services for your GCP account, select the individual services you want New Relic to receive data from, or select all of the services. Tip These services will be enabled for all of the projects that you selected in the previous step. Once the setup process is finished, you can fine-tune the services that you want monitored for each project individually. To complete the setup process, select Finish. If you see API authentication errors, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Explore app data in New Relic After you authorize New Relic to integrate one or more of your Google project's services, New Relic starts monitoring your GCP data at regular polling intervals. After a few minutes, data will appear in the New Relic UI. To find and use your data, including links to dashboards and alert settings, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. Link multiple Google projects For your convenience, the setup process allows you to select more than one project at a time. After the first setup, if you need to monitor additional GCP projects with New Relic, you can repeat the procedure to connect your GCP services as many times as you need. Unlink your GCP integrations You can disable any of your GCP integrations any time and still keep your Google project connected to New Relic. If you want to... Do this Disable a GCP service monitoring To disconnect individual GCP services but keep the integration with New Relic for other GCP services in your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, make changes to the checkbox options for available services and select Save changes. Unlink your project monitoring To uninstall all of your GCP services completely from New Relic Integrations, unlink your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, select Unlink account and select Save changes. Clean your GCP Projects after unlinking New Relic To clean your GCP project after unlinking, follow these steps if you were using a service account: Open the GCP IAM Console. Select the project you want to unlink from New Relic and click Open. Select the service account that is used by New Relic. Click the Remove icon. Or follow these steps if you were using a user account: Open your Google user account settings. Open the Apps with access to your account section. Choose New Relic application. Choose Remove Access.",

      "body": "To start receiving Google Cloud Platform (GCP) data with New Relic GCP integrations, connect your Google project to New Relic infrastructure monitoring. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Requirements These are the requirements for the authorization: GCP integration requirements Comments Monitoring In the GCP project API & Services Library settings, you must enable Google Stackdriver Monitoring API. Authorization For service account authorization (recommended): A user with Project IAM Admin role is needed to add the service account ID as a member in your GCP project. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the service account must have the Project Viewer role and the Service Usage Consumer role or, alternatively, a custom role. For user account authorization: The New Relic user that will integrate the GCP project must have a Google account and must be able to view the GCP project that New Relic will monitor. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the user must have the Project Viewer role. Please note that this authorization method will not allow New Relic to collect labels and other inventory attributes that can be useful for narrowing down your NRQL queries, dashboards and alerts. You can migrate the authorization method from user account to service account from the Manage services link in New Relic's user interface. Project name As part of the online setup process, you must identify Project name of the projects you want to monitor with New Relic. The UI workflow automatically lists active projects you can select. Permissions (only for user account authorization) New Relic requires a specific set of read-only permissions exclusively; this means that, for certain integrations, only partial inventory data will be available. Keep in mind that New Relic doesn't inherit your Google account's permissions and therefore is not authorized to perform any changes in the project. For more information about the API permissions that New Relic uses, see the Google documentation about scopes. Authorization options Integrating your GCP project with New Relic requires you to authorize New Relic to fetch monitoring data from your GCP project. You can choose between two authorization methods: Service accounts or User accounts. Service account (recommended) The service account authorization is recommended. If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a service account, we will call your GCP project APIs using a service account ID and its associated public/private key pair. New Relic manages a specific Google service account for your New Relic account; you do not need to create it or manage the associated private key. Just add the service account ID as a member with viewing permissions in your project. If your organization uses a domain restriction constraint, you will have to update the policy to allow the New Relic domain, C02x1gp26. This authorization method is recommended, especially if your GCP project is managed by a team. It also guarantees that New Relic will collect labels and inventory attributes whenever possible. User account If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a user account, New Relic will access your GCP project monitoring data on behalf of a particular Google user. The authorization process is achieved through an OAuth workflow, which redirects you from the New Relic UI to a Google authorization interface. However, since the authorization is linked to a particular Google user, this method is not recommended for GCP projects that are managed by large teams. Connect GCP to New Relic infrastructure monitoring To connect your Google account to New Relic with user account authorization: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. At the top of Infrastructure's Google Cloud Services integrations page, select Add a GCP account. Choose Authorization Method: Select either Authorize a Service Account or Authorize a User Account, and follow the instructions in the UI to authorize New Relic. Add projects: Select the projects that you want New Relic to receive data from. Select services: From the list of available services for your GCP account, select the individual services you want New Relic to receive data from, or select all of the services. Tip These services will be enabled for all of the projects that you selected in the previous step. Once the setup process is finished, you can fine-tune the services that you want monitored for each project individually. To complete the setup process, select Finish. If you see API authentication errors, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Explore app data in New Relic After you authorize New Relic to integrate one or more of your Google project's services, New Relic starts monitoring your GCP data at regular polling intervals. After a few minutes, data will appear in the New Relic UI. To find and use your data, including links to dashboards and alert settings, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. Link multiple Google projects For your convenience, the setup process allows you to select more than one project at a time. After the first setup, if you need to monitor additional GCP projects with New Relic, you can repeat the procedure to connect your GCP services as many times as you need. Unlink your GCP integrations You can disable any of your GCP integrations any time and still keep your Google project connected to New Relic. If you want to... Do this Disable a GCP service monitoring To disconnect individual GCP services but keep the integration with New Relic for other GCP services in your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, make changes to the checkbox options for available services and select Save changes. Unlink your project monitoring To uninstall all of your GCP services completely from New Relic Integrations, unlink your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, select Unlink account and select Save changes. Clean your GCP Projects after unlinking New Relic To clean your GCP project after unlinking, follow these steps if you were using a service account: Open the GCP IAM Console. Select the project you want to unlink from New Relic and click Open. Select the service account that is used by New Relic. Click the Remove icon. Or follow these steps if you were using a user account: Open your Google user account settings. Open the Apps with access to your account section. Choose New Relic application. Choose Remove Access.",

To access these APIs in your Google Cloud project, the New Relic authorized account needs to be granted a certain set of permissions; GCP uses roles to grant these permissions. Recommended role By default we highly recommend using the GCP primitive role Role Viewer, which grants \"permissions for read-only actions that do not affect your cloud infrastructure state, such as viewing (but not modifying) existing resources or data.\" This role is automatically managed by Google and updated when new Google Cloud services are released or modified. Optional role Alternatively, you can create your own custom role based on the list of permissions, which specifies the minimum set of permissions required to fetch data from each GCP integration. This will allow you to have more control over the permissions set for the New Relic authorized account. Important New Relic has no way of identifying problems related to custom permissions. If you choose to create a custom role, it is your responsibility to maintain it and ensure proper data is being collected. To customize your role you need to: Create a Google Cloud IAM Custom Role in each one of the GCP projects you want to monitor with New Relic. In each custom role, add the permissions that are specifically required for the cloud services you want to monitor according to the following list. Assign the custom role(s) to the New Relic authorized account. List of permissions Common permissions All integrations need the following permission: monitoring.timeSeries.list serviceusage.services.use Service-specific permissions For some GCP integrations, New Relic will also need the following permissions, mainly to collect labels and inventory attributes.

After the projects are linked, assign a Google Cloud custom role to the authorized account. Use New Relic NerdGraph to link Google Cloud projects to New Relic.

      "body": "To start receiving Google Cloud Platform (GCP) data with New Relic GCP integrations, connect your Google project to New Relic infrastructure monitoring. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Requirements These are the requirements for the authorization: GCP integration requirements Comments Monitoring In the GCP project API & Services Library settings, you must enable Google Stackdriver Monitoring API. Authorization For service account authorization (recommended): A user with Project IAM Admin role is needed to add the service account ID as a member in your GCP project. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the service account must have the Project Viewer role and the Service Usage Consumer role or, alternatively, a custom role. For user account authorization: The New Relic user that will integrate the GCP project must have a Google account and must be able to view the GCP project that New Relic will monitor. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the user must have the Project Viewer role. Please note that this authorization method will not allow New Relic to collect labels and other inventory attributes that can be useful for narrowing down your NRQL queries, dashboards and alerts. You can migrate the authorization method from user account to service account from the Manage services link in New Relic's user interface. Project name As part of the online setup process, you must identify Project name of the projects you want to monitor with New Relic. The UI workflow automatically lists active projects you can select. Permissions (only for user account authorization) New Relic requires a specific set of read-only permissions exclusively; this means that, for certain integrations, only partial inventory data will be available. Keep in mind that New Relic doesn't inherit your Google account's permissions and therefore is not authorized to perform any changes in the project. For more information about the API permissions that New Relic uses, see the Google documentation about scopes. Authorization options Integrating your GCP project with New Relic requires you to authorize New Relic to fetch monitoring data from your GCP project. You can choose between two authorization methods: Service accounts or User accounts. Service account (recommended) The service account authorization is recommended. If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a service account, we will call your GCP project APIs using a service account ID and its associated public/private key pair. New Relic manages a specific Google service account for your New Relic account; you do not need to create it or manage the associated private key. Just add the service account ID as a member with viewing permissions in your project. If your organization uses a domain restriction constraint, you will have to update the policy to allow the New Relic domain, C02x1gp26. This authorization method is recommended, especially if your GCP project is managed by a team. It also guarantees that New Relic will collect labels and inventory attributes whenever possible. User account If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a user account, New Relic will access your GCP project monitoring data on behalf of a particular Google user. The authorization process is achieved through an OAuth workflow, which redirects you from the New Relic UI to a Google authorization interface. However, since the authorization is linked to a particular Google user, this method is not recommended for GCP projects that are managed by large teams. Connect GCP to New Relic infrastructure monitoring To connect your Google account to New Relic with user account authorization: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. At the top of Infrastructure's Google Cloud Services integrations page, select Add a GCP account. Choose Authorization Method: Select either Authorize a Service Account or Authorize a User Account, and follow the instructions in the UI to authorize New Relic. Add projects: Select the projects that you want New Relic to receive data from. Select services: From the list of available services for your GCP account, select the individual services you want New Relic to receive data from, or select all of the services. Tip These services will be enabled for all of the projects that you selected in the previous step. Once the setup process is finished, you can fine-tune the services that you want monitored for each project individually. To complete the setup process, select Finish. If you see API authentication errors, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Explore app data in New Relic After you authorize New Relic to integrate one or more of your Google project's services, New Relic starts monitoring your GCP data at regular polling intervals. After a few minutes, data will appear in the New Relic UI. To find and use your data, including links to dashboards and alert settings, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. Link multiple Google projects For your convenience, the setup process allows you to select more than one project at a time. After the first setup, if you need to monitor additional GCP projects with New Relic, you can repeat the procedure to connect your GCP services as many times as you need. Unlink your GCP integrations You can disable any of your GCP integrations any time and still keep your Google project connected to New Relic. If you want to... Do this Disable a GCP service monitoring To disconnect individual GCP services but keep the integration with New Relic for other GCP services in your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, make changes to the checkbox options for available services and select Save changes. Unlink your project monitoring To uninstall all of your GCP services completely from New Relic Integrations, unlink your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, select Unlink account and select Save changes. Clean your GCP Projects after unlinking New Relic To clean your GCP project after unlinking, follow these steps if you were using a service account: Open the GCP IAM Console. Select the project you want to unlink from New Relic and click Open. Select the service account that is used by New Relic. Click the Remove icon.

      "body": "To start receiving Google Cloud Platform (GCP) data with New Relic GCP integrations, connect your Google project to New Relic infrastructure monitoring. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Requirements These are the requirements for the authorization: GCP integration requirements Comments Monitoring In the GCP project API & Services Library settings, you must enable Google Stackdriver Monitoring API. Authorization For service account authorization (recommended): A user with Project IAM Admin role is needed to add the service account ID as a member in your GCP project. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the service account must have the Project Viewer role and the Service Usage Consumer role or, alternatively, a custom role. For user account authorization: The New Relic user that will integrate the GCP project must have a Google account and must be able to view the GCP project that New Relic will monitor. In the GCP project IAM & admin, the user must have the Project Viewer role. Please note that this authorization method will not allow New Relic to collect labels and other inventory attributes that can be useful for narrowing down your NRQL queries, dashboards and alerts. You can migrate the authorization method from user account to service account from the Manage services link in New Relic's user interface. Project name As part of the online setup process, you must identify Project name of the projects you want to monitor with New Relic. The UI workflow automatically lists active projects you can select. Permissions (only for user account authorization) New Relic requires a specific set of read-only permissions exclusively; this means that, for certain integrations, only partial inventory data will be available. Keep in mind that New Relic doesn't inherit your Google account's permissions and therefore is not authorized to perform any changes in the project. For more information about the API permissions that New Relic uses, see the Google documentation about scopes. Authorization options Integrating your GCP project with New Relic requires you to authorize New Relic to fetch monitoring data from your GCP project. You can choose between two authorization methods: Service accounts or User accounts. Service account (recommended) The service account authorization is recommended. If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a service account, we will call your GCP project APIs using a service account ID and its associated public/private key pair. New Relic manages a specific Google service account for your New Relic account; you do not need to create it or manage the associated private key. Just add the service account ID as a member with viewing permissions in your project. If your organization uses a domain restriction constraint, you will have to update the policy to allow the New Relic domain, C02x1gp26. This authorization method is recommended, especially if your GCP project is managed by a team. It also guarantees that New Relic will collect labels and inventory attributes whenever possible. User account If you authorize New Relic to fetch data through a user account, New Relic will access your GCP project monitoring data on behalf of a particular Google user. The authorization process is achieved through an OAuth workflow, which redirects you from the New Relic UI to a Google authorization interface. However, since the authorization is linked to a particular Google user, this method is not recommended for GCP projects that are managed by large teams. Connect GCP to New Relic infrastructure monitoring To connect your Google account to New Relic with user account authorization: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. At the top of Infrastructure's Google Cloud Services integrations page, select Add a GCP account. Choose Authorization Method: Select either Authorize a Service Account or Authorize a User Account, and follow the instructions in the UI to authorize New Relic. Add projects: Select the projects that you want New Relic to receive data from. Select services: From the list of available services for your GCP account, select the individual services you want New Relic to receive data from, or select all of the services. Tip These services will be enabled for all of the projects that you selected in the previous step. Once the setup process is finished, you can fine-tune the services that you want monitored for each project individually. To complete the setup process, select Finish. If you see API authentication errors, follow the troubleshooting procedures. Explore app data in New Relic After you authorize New Relic to integrate one or more of your Google project's services, New Relic starts monitoring your GCP data at regular polling intervals. After a few minutes, data will appear in the New Relic UI. To find and use your data, including links to dashboards and alert settings, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP. Link multiple Google projects For your convenience, the setup process allows you to select more than one project at a time. After the first setup, if you need to monitor additional GCP projects with New Relic, you can repeat the procedure to connect your GCP services as many times as you need. Unlink your GCP integrations You can disable any of your GCP integrations any time and still keep your Google project connected to New Relic. If you want to... Do this Disable a GCP service monitoring To disconnect individual GCP services but keep the integration with New Relic for other GCP services in your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, make changes to the checkbox options for available services and select Save changes. Unlink your project monitoring To uninstall all of your GCP services completely from New Relic Integrations, unlink your Google account: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > GCP and select Manage services. From your GCP account page, select Unlink account and select Save changes. Clean your GCP Projects after unlinking New Relic To clean your GCP project after unlinking, follow these steps if you were using a service account: Open the GCP IAM Console. Select the project you want to unlink from New Relic and click Open. Select the service account that is used by New Relic. Click the Remove icon. Or follow these steps if you were using a user account: Open your Google user account settings. Open the Apps with access to your account section. Choose New Relic application. Choose Remove Access.",

Enabling the AWS CloudWatch Metric Streams integration is the recommended solution to monitor all CloudWatch metrics from all AWS services (including custom namespaces). On top of this, additional integrations are available to get extended visibility on key AWS services beyond the available CloudWatch metrics. For a full reference of the supported metrics, please check the available CloudWatch metrics for each service in the AWS documentation pages. Connect AWS and New Relic In order to obtain AWS data, follow the procedure to connect AWS to New Relic. Additional API Polling integrations can be enabled on top of the AWS CloudWatch metric streams in order to pull data that's not available as CloudWatch metrics. The following integrations are not replaced by the metric streams: AWS Billing AWS CloudTrail AWS Health AWS Trusted Advisor AWS VPC Finally, other integrations may require additional configurations in your AWS account: AWS VPC Flow Logs AWS CloudFormation Integrations and AWS costs Keep in mind the following items: AWS CloudWatch metric streams pricing is defined based on the number of metric updates. For up-to-date pricing information check AWS CloudWatch Pricing. AWS Kinesis Data Firehose is used as the delivery method. For details, see the AWS Firehose pricing page. AWS Config can be optionally enabled in your AWS account, and used to enrich CloudWatch metrics with custom tags and resource metadata. With AWS Config, you are charged based on the number of configuration items recorded. See the AWS Config pricing page for details. If polling integrations are enabled (instead of metric streams), New Relic uses the Amazon CloudWatch API to obtain metrics from the AWS services you monitor. The number of calls to the CloudWatch API increases as you enable more integrations. Add AWS resources to those integrations, or scale those integrations across more regions. This can cause requests to the CloudWatch API to exceed the 1 million free limits granted by AWS and increase your CloudWatch bill. AWS offers enhanced monitoring for some of their services which allows for more metrics, more often. For example, see RDS enhanced monitoring costs. View your AWS data Once you follow the configuration process, data from your Amazon Web Services report directly to New Relic. AWS entities for most used services will be listed in the New Relic Explorer. Metrics and events will appear in the Data Explorer. AWS data will also be visible in the Infrastructure UI. To view your AWS data: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS. For any of the AWS integrations listed: For active streams, select the Explore your data link. OR For other integrations, browse the available dashboard or click on the Explore Data link. You can view and reuse NRQL queries both in the pre-configured dashboards and in the Events explorer dashboards. This allows you to tailor queries to your specific needs. Region availability Most AWS services offer regional endpoints to reduce data latency between cloud resources and applications. New Relic can obtain monitoring data from services and endpoints that are located in all AWS regions, except China.",

Connect AWS to New Relic Important AWS CloudWatch metric streams is now the recommended solution to monitor AWS services. Learn more in New Relic's CloudWatch solution and AWS CloudWatch blog posts. Follow the steps documented in the AWS CloudWatch metric stream integration to ingest all available CloudWatch metrics. To connect additional API Polling integrations: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS. Click on one of the available service tiles. From the IAM console, click Create role, then click Another AWS account. For Account ID, use 754728514883. Check the Require external ID box. For External ID, enter your New Relic account ID. Do not enable the setting to Require MFA (multi-factor authentication). Attach the Policy: Search for ReadOnlyAccess, select the checkbox for the policy named ReadOnlyAccess, then click Next: Review. Alternatively, you can create your own managed policy and limit the permissions you grant New Relic according to the AWS services you want to monitor. For the Role name, enter NewRelicInfrastructure-Integrations, then click Create role. Select the newly created role from the listed roles. On the Role summary page, select and copy the entire Role ARN (required later in this procedure). Configure a Budgets policy: While viewing the Role summary for your new role, select Add inline policy. Create a Custom policy: Enter a policy name (for example, NewRelicBudget), add the following permission statement, and then select Apply policy. { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"budgets:ViewBudget\" ], \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy Return to the New Relic UI to enter your AWS account name and the ARN for the new role. Select the Amazon Web Services to be monitored with New Relic infrastructure integrations, then Save. Connect multiple AWS integrations To connect multiple AWS integrations to a single New Relic account: If you previously set up an ARN with the more restrictive AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess policy, first unlink your existing integration, then create a new one with a broader policy. Follow the instructions to connect your Amazon account to New Relic . Provide the ARN that contains the ReadOnlyAccess policy. Once setup is complete, select the integrations you want to monitor: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS. Select the edit icon. Select the checkbox for each integration you want to monitor. Connect multiple AWS accounts By default, the Amazon EC2 AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess permission grants New Relic access to all EC2 instances in the individual Amazon account you specify during the setup steps. If you have multiple AWS accounts, follow the steps to connect an AWS account for each AWS account you want to associate with New Relic. Add or edit custom tags New Relic automatically imports custom tags you have added or edited for your AWS resources. Most metrics received via CloudWatch metric streams will have custom tags as dimensions. For API Polling integrations, if you don't see any tags in the Add filter menu of the Filter sets sidebar within a few minutes, delete the integration and try again: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS. Select the edit icon. Remove individual integrations or the entire account linkage as needed. Note that not all integrations support tags collection. You can enable (and disable) tags collection in the integration settings. Disconnect your AWS integrations You can disable one or more integrations anytime and still keep your AWS account connected to New Relic. However, New Relic recommends that you do not disable EC2 or EBS monitoring. These two integrations add important metadata to your EC2 instances and EBS volumes in New Relic. To uninstall your services completely from New Relic infrastructure Integrations, unlink your AWS account. Regional support China regions are not supported.",

      "body": "In Grafana, you can configure New Relic as a Prometheus data source. Not only that, within Grafana you can query metrics stored in New Relic using the PromQL query language. Use existing Grafana dashboards with New Relic When you integrate Prometheus metrics with New Relic via Remote Write or the OpenMetrics Integration (2.0+) and configure New Relic as a Prometheus data source in Grafana, you can use existing Grafana dashboards and seamlessly tap into the additional monitoring, reliability, and scale we provide. Compatibility and requirements Before you begin, make sure you’ve finished integrating Prometheus metrics and are running a recent enough version of Grafana. You should have either the Remote Write or the OpenMetrics Integration ( v2.0+) set up before you can configure New Relic Prometheus data sources in Grafana. You can only configure New Relic Prometheus data sources using this method in Grafana versions 6.7.0 or newer. You will need to configure custom headers in the UI, and this isn’t possible with earlier versions. For details, see Configure New Relic as a Prometheus data source for Grafana. Support for PromQL Our Prometheus API emulates Prometheus' query APIs. We support the Prometheus query language (PromQL) through our PromQL-style query mode. We do our best to automatically translate PromQL syntax queries into the closest NRQL approximation. For more information on how this works and differences you may observe between Prometheus and New Relic, see Supported PromQL features. Get data flowing in Grafana To make your New Relic data available in Grafana, you can configure a new or existing Prometheus data source in just a couple of simple steps: In the Grafana UI, add and configure a new data source. Save the new data source and start viewing your data. What’s next? Ready to configure a Grafana data source?

      "body": "What is MLOps? MLOps stands for machine-learning operations. As more companies invest in artificial intelligence and machine learning, there's a gap in understanding between the data science teams developing machine-learning models and the DevOps teams operating the applications that power those models. MLOps provides a tool for monitoring and observing the performance and effectiveness of machine-learning models in a production environment. This increases the possibilities for collaboration between data science and DevOps teams, feeding into a continuous process of development, testing, and operational monitoring. The Aporia integration Aporia is a fast, easy, and secure way for data science teams to monitor their machine learning models in production. With Aporia, teams can build their own customizable monitors in minutes to receive live alerts for early detection of issues like data drift, unexpected bias, data integrity issues, and performance degradation. Aporia also has an investigation toolbox to enable further investigation and root cause analysis. Learn more about Aporia. Aporia now offers an integration with New Relic to provide full model management of the MLOps infrastructure, with customized dashboards within New Relic that show inferences investigation. Integrate Aporia with New Relic Aporia allows you to connect alerts generated by Aporia’s monitors to New Relic’s Incident Intelligence engine and the predictions data in order to create a comprehensive monitoring dashboard in New Relic for your models.

Superwise now offers an integration with New Relic to help users add the state of their AI as monitored by Superwise to their centralized operational view on New Relic. Migrate Data from Superwise with New Relic Superwise’s KPI and incidents integration streamlines results of our out-of-the-box model KPIs, including drift, activity, incidents, and any custom KPI you configure, directly into New Relic One. You’ll get an immediate overview of which models are misbehaving that can be tailored to any use case, logic, segmentation, threshold, and sensitivity. In order to receive data from Superwise into New Relic, you’ll need to do the following: Login into your New Relic account: Log into one.newrelic.com and click on Explorer. On the upper hand corner, on the main navigation menu, click on + Add more data. Click on Superwise: In the search bar, type Superwise or scroll down to the MLOps Integration section, then click on the Superwise icon. Select an account ID: Select the account ID you want Superwise to integrate with. Create two access tokens: Once you select an Account ID, under Prediction data + Generate Dashboard, click Create a key. This is your new telemetry API key. In addition, under Model quality metric, click Create a Key. This is your Incident Insights key. Keep the New Relic page open for future steps. Log into the Superwise portal: Log into the Superwise portal and go to Notification channel settings. Select New Relic and create a channel name. Copy and paste the token in Superwise: Go back to the New Relic integration dashboard and copy the two tokens you created by clicking on the copy icon next to the API key and Insight key. On Superwise’s portal, on the New Relic channel, paste the API key under Incident Intelligence API, and the Insight key under Telemetry Key. Finish by clicking Save. Verify the Token: Click on the Test button in the Superwise channel portal, to verify both tokens are working properly. A green or red status box should appear to indicate the verification. View and explore your Superwise models in New Relic dashboards Once a user configures the New Relic integration in Superwise, standard model metrics are sent to New Relic and users get model observability dashboards within New Relic. Users can also configure any specific model metric and incident policy and send them to New Relic for model observability tailored to their business context. Go to the integration dashboard: Once you’ve tested your tokens and confirmed the integration is set up correctly, return to the New Relic integration dashboard and click on See your data. This will redirect you to an automatically generated dashboard powered by Superwise. Analyze Superwise’s dashboard. Superwise’s dashboard contains 3 charts: The Model activity chart displays the number of active models, their activity, and the total number of predictions during a filtered timeframe. The Model input drift detection chart displays which models are drifting and may require retraining using a model drift leveler, scaled between 0 and 100. The Incident Insights chart displays how many models have open incidents, how incidents are being distributed, and deeper details on the model incident itself. Customize metrics and incidents in Superwise: Teams can easily customize any model metric and incident type in the Superwise platform. They can then search for these metrics in the New Relic Browser tab under Metrics. To do this, follow the instructions in step 4 in the Superwise docs. Setup alert notifications: Once you've created some dashboards, you can get alerted on your data. To create a NRQL alerts condition from a chart, click the chart widget, then click Create alert condition. Once you've named and customized your condition, you can add it to an existing policy or create a new one.

      "body": "Tip Want to help make this doc better? Try our beta MySQL monitoring integration doc and give us feedback by creating a GitHub issue. Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. Quick start Instrument your MySQL database quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the MySQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MySQL database. Install and activate To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-mysql. Change the directory to the integration's folder. cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file mysql-config.yml as explained in the next section. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional.

      "body": "Before installing our infrastructure agent, make sure your system and any on-host integrations you configure meet the requirements. You also need a New Relic account. Sign up for free. No credit card required. Processor architectures The infrastructure agent supports these processor architectures: Linux: 64-bit for x86 processor architectures (also requires 64-bit package manager and dependencies) Windows: both 32 and 64-bit for x86 processor architectures ARM: arm64 architecture including AWS Graviton 2 processor is supported on compatible Linux operating sytems. On-host integrations are also supported (with the exception of the Oracle integration). Built-in log forwarding is not yet available. macOS (Beta): 64-bit x86 processor (M1 processor is not supported yet). Operating systems The infrastructure agent supports these operating systems up to their manufacturer's end-of-life. Operating system Supported by the infrastructure agent Amazon Linux All versions CentOS Version 7 or higher Debian Version 8 (\"Jessie\") or higher Docker Docker 1.12 Kubernetes Tested with versions 1.16 to 1.22 Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Version 7 or higher Oracle Linux Version 7 or higher SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) Versions 11.4, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 12.5, 15, 15.1, 15.2, 15.3 Ubuntu LTS versions 16.04.x, 18.04.x, 20.04.x Interim releases 20.10, 21.04. Windows Windows Server 2012, 2016, and 2019, and their service packs. Windows 10 and their service packs. macOS macOS 10.14 (Mohave), 10.15 (Catalina), 11 (Big Sur). You can also monitor Amazon BottleRocket workloads: When running EC2 instances, use the containerized agent. On EKS, install the Kubernetes integration. For ECS clusters, deploy the ECS integration. Unique hostname The infrastructure agent uses the hostname to uniquely identify each server. To avoid inaccurate metrics from combining multiple servers under a single hostname, make sure that each monitored server has a unique hostname. You can use the optional display_name setting to override the default hostname. Servers named localhost are not reported because this is a default name and inherently non-unique. Permissions The infrastructure agent requires these permissions: Linux: By default, the agent runs and installs as root. You can also select privileged or unprivileged run modes. Windows: The agent must be installed from an Administrator account and requires Administrator privileges to run. macOS: The agent can be installed from any user account. Libraries For agent versions 1.1.19 or higher, you need the libcap library in order to install Infrastructure. It's available in the official repositories of your distribution. Network access In order to report data to New Relic, our infrastructure agent must have outbound access to certain domains and ports. If your system needs a proxy to connect to these domains, use the proxy setting. Container software The infrastructure agent instruments Docker containers when installed on the host server. We support Docker versions 1.12 or higher. CPU, memory, and disk usage The infrastructure agent is fairly lightweight. For typical CPU, memory, and disk usage, see our page on agent performance overhead. For more information on supported file systems, see Storage sample attributes. Configuration management tools The infrastructure agent can be deployed programmatically using several config management and deploy tools: Ansible Chef Elastic Beanstalk Puppet",

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host where PostgreSQL is installed or on a host capable of remotely accessing where PostgreSQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered.

Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to these event types: PostgresqlDatabaseSample PostgresqlIndexSample PostgresqlInstanceSample PostgresqlTableSample PgBouncerSample You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The PostgreSQL integration collects the following database metric attributes.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Tip Want to help make this doc better? Try our beta MySQL monitoring integration doc and give us feedback by creating a GitHub issue. Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. Quick start Instrument your MySQL database quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the MySQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MySQL database. Install and activate To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-mysql. Change the directory to the integration's folder. cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file mysql-config.yml as explained in the next section. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host where PostgreSQL is installed or on a host capable of remotely accessing where PostgreSQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL SSL configuration collection file integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' ENABLE_SSL: true TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE: false SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/root_cert.crt SSL_CERT_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/postgresql.crt SSL_KEY_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/postgresql.key TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL custom query integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: ALL CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY: >- select 'rows_inserted' as \"metric_name\", 'delta' as \"metric_type\", sd.tup_inserted as \"metric_value\", sd.datid as \"database_id\" from pg_stat_database sd; TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL custom query config file An additional YAML configuration file with one or more custom SQL can be defined and the integration will need the path to the file in the CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG parameter. postgresql-config.yml integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: ALL CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG: \"path/to/postgresql-custom-query.yml\" TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy postgresql-custom-query.yml --- queries: # Metric names are set to the column names in the query results - query: >- SELECT BG.checkpoints_timed AS scheduled_checkpoints_performed, BG.checkpoints_req AS requested_checkpoints_performed, BG.buffers_checkpoint AS buffers_written_during_checkpoint, BG.buffers_clean AS buffers_written_by_background_writer, BG.maxwritten_clean AS background_writer_stops, BG.buffers_backend AS buffers_written_by_backend, BG.buffers_alloc AS buffers_allocated FROM pg_stat_bgwriter BG; # database defaults to the auth database in the main config database: new_frontier_config_dev # If not set explicitly here, metric type will default to # 'gauge' for numbers and 'attribute' for strings metric_types: buffers_allocated: rate # If unset, sample_name defaults to PostgresqlCustomSample sample_name: MyCustomSample Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host where PostgreSQL is installed or on a host capable of remotely accessing where PostgreSQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL SSL configuration collection file integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' ENABLE_SSL: true TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE: false SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/root_cert.crt SSL_CERT_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/postgresql.crt SSL_KEY_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/postgresql.key TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL custom query integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: ALL CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY: >- select 'rows_inserted' as \"metric_name\", 'delta' as \"metric_type\", sd.tup_inserted as \"metric_value\", sd.datid as \"database_id\" from pg_stat_database sd; TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL custom query config file An additional YAML configuration file with one or more custom SQL can be defined and the integration will need the path to the file in the CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG parameter. postgresql-config.yml integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: ALL CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG: \"path/to/postgresql-custom-query.yml\" TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy postgresql-custom-query.yml --- queries: # Metric names are set to the column names in the query results - query: >- SELECT BG.checkpoints_timed AS scheduled_checkpoints_performed, BG.checkpoints_req AS requested_checkpoints_performed, BG.buffers_checkpoint AS buffers_written_during_checkpoint, BG.buffers_clean AS buffers_written_by_background_writer, BG.maxwritten_clean AS background_writer_stops, BG.buffers_backend AS buffers_written_by_backend, BG.buffers_alloc AS buffers_allocated FROM pg_stat_bgwriter BG; # database defaults to the auth database in the main config database: new_frontier_config_dev # If not set explicitly here, metric type will default to # 'gauge' for numbers and 'attribute' for strings metric_types: buffers_allocated: rate # If unset, sample_name defaults to PostgresqlCustomSample sample_name: MyCustomSample Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host where PostgreSQL is installed or on a host capable of remotely accessing where PostgreSQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL SSL configuration collection file integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' ENABLE_SSL: true TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE: false SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/root_cert.crt SSL_CERT_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/postgresql.crt SSL_KEY_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/postgresql.key TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL custom query integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: ALL CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY: >- select 'rows_inserted' as \"metric_name\", 'delta' as \"metric_type\", sd.tup_inserted as \"metric_value\", sd.datid as \"database_id\" from pg_stat_database sd; TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL custom query config file An additional YAML configuration file with one or more custom SQL can be defined and the integration will need the path to the file in the CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG parameter. postgresql-config.yml integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: ALL CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG: \"path/to/postgresql-custom-query.yml\" TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy postgresql-custom-query.yml --- queries: # Metric names are set to the column names in the query results - query: >- SELECT BG.checkpoints_timed AS scheduled_checkpoints_performed, BG.checkpoints_req AS requested_checkpoints_performed, BG.buffers_checkpoint AS buffers_written_during_checkpoint, BG.buffers_clean AS buffers_written_by_background_writer, BG.maxwritten_clean AS background_writer_stops, BG.buffers_backend AS buffers_written_by_backend, BG.buffers_alloc AS buffers_allocated FROM pg_stat_bgwriter BG; # database defaults to the auth database in the main config database: new_frontier_config_dev # If not set explicitly here, metric type will default to # 'gauge' for numbers and 'attribute' for strings metric_types: buffers_allocated: rate # If unset, sample_name defaults to PostgresqlCustomSample sample_name: MyCustomSample Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host where PostgreSQL is installed or on a host capable of remotely accessing where PostgreSQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL SSL configuration collection file integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' ENABLE_SSL: true TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE: false SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/root_cert.crt SSL_CERT_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/postgresql.crt SSL_KEY_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/postgresql.key TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL custom query integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: ALL CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY: >- select 'rows_inserted' as \"metric_name\", 'delta' as \"metric_type\", sd.tup_inserted as \"metric_value\", sd.datid as \"database_id\" from pg_stat_database sd; TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL custom query config file An additional YAML configuration file with one or more custom SQL can be defined and the integration will need the path to the file in the CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG parameter. postgresql-config.yml integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: ALL CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG: \"path/to/postgresql-custom-query.yml\" TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy postgresql-custom-query.yml --- queries: # Metric names are set to the column names in the query results - query: >- SELECT BG.checkpoints_timed AS scheduled_checkpoints_performed, BG.checkpoints_req AS requested_checkpoints_performed, BG.buffers_checkpoint AS buffers_written_during_checkpoint, BG.buffers_clean AS buffers_written_by_background_writer, BG.maxwritten_clean AS background_writer_stops, BG.buffers_backend AS buffers_written_by_backend, BG.buffers_alloc AS buffers_allocated FROM pg_stat_bgwriter BG; # database defaults to the auth database in the main config database: new_frontier_config_dev # If not set explicitly here, metric type will default to # 'gauge' for numbers and 'attribute' for strings metric_types: buffers_allocated: rate # If unset, sample_name defaults to PostgresqlCustomSample sample_name: MyCustomSample Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host where PostgreSQL is installed or on a host capable of remotely accessing where PostgreSQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL SSL configuration collection file integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' ENABLE_SSL: true TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE: false SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/root_cert.crt SSL_CERT_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/postgresql.crt SSL_KEY_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/postgresql.key TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL custom query integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: ALL CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY: >- select 'rows_inserted' as \"metric_name\", 'delta' as \"metric_type\", sd.tup_inserted as \"metric_value\", sd.datid as \"database_id\" from pg_stat_database sd; TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL custom query config file An additional YAML configuration file with one or more custom SQL can be defined and the integration will need the path to the file in the CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG parameter. postgresql-config.yml integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: ALL CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG: \"path/to/postgresql-custom-query.yml\" TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy postgresql-custom-query.yml --- queries: # Metric names are set to the column names in the query results - query: >- SELECT BG.checkpoints_timed AS scheduled_checkpoints_performed, BG.checkpoints_req AS requested_checkpoints_performed, BG.buffers_checkpoint AS buffers_written_during_checkpoint, BG.buffers_clean AS buffers_written_by_background_writer, BG.maxwritten_clean AS background_writer_stops, BG.buffers_backend AS buffers_written_by_backend, BG.buffers_alloc AS buffers_allocated FROM pg_stat_bgwriter BG; # database defaults to the auth database in the main config database: new_frontier_config_dev # If not set explicitly here, metric type will default to # 'gauge' for numbers and 'attribute' for strings metric_types: buffers_allocated: rate # If unset, sample_name defaults to PostgresqlCustomSample sample_name: MyCustomSample Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host where PostgreSQL is installed or on a host capable of remotely accessing where PostgreSQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL SSL configuration collection file integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' ENABLE_SSL: true TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE: false SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/root_cert.crt SSL_CERT_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/postgresql.crt SSL_KEY_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/postgresql.key TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL custom query integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: ALL CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY: >- select 'rows_inserted' as \"metric_name\", 'delta' as \"metric_type\", sd.tup_inserted as \"metric_value\", sd.datid as \"database_id\" from pg_stat_database sd; TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL custom query config file An additional YAML configuration file with one or more custom SQL can be defined and the integration will need the path to the file in the CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG parameter. postgresql-config.yml integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: ALL CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG: \"path/to/postgresql-custom-query.yml\" TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy postgresql-custom-query.yml --- queries: # Metric names are set to the column names in the query results - query: >- SELECT BG.checkpoints_timed AS scheduled_checkpoints_performed, BG.checkpoints_req AS requested_checkpoints_performed, BG.buffers_checkpoint AS buffers_written_during_checkpoint, BG.buffers_clean AS buffers_written_by_background_writer, BG.maxwritten_clean AS background_writer_stops, BG.buffers_backend AS buffers_written_by_backend, BG.buffers_alloc AS buffers_allocated FROM pg_stat_bgwriter BG; # database defaults to the auth database in the main config database: new_frontier_config_dev # If not set explicitly here, metric type will default to # 'gauge' for numbers and 'attribute' for strings metric_types: buffers_allocated: rate # If unset, sample_name defaults to PostgresqlCustomSample sample_name: MyCustomSample Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Tip Want to help make this doc better? Try our beta NGINX monitoring integration doc and give us feedback by creating a GitHub issue. Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. Quick start Instrument your MySQL database quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the MySQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MySQL database. Install and activate To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-mysql. Change the directory to the integration's folder. cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file mysql-config.yml as explained in the next section. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host where PostgreSQL is installed or on a host capable of remotely accessing where PostgreSQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements.

Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details.

This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below.

For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX.

Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. Quick start Instrument your MySQL database quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the MySQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MySQL database. Install and activate To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-mysql. Change the directory to the integration's folder. cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file mysql-config.yml as explained in the next section. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host where PostgreSQL is installed or on a host capable of remotely accessing where PostgreSQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started?

But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MySQL database. Install and activate To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-mysql. Change the directory to the integration's folder. cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file mysql-config.yml as explained in the next section. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host where PostgreSQL is installed or on a host capable of remotely accessing where PostgreSQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL SSL configuration collection file integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' ENABLE_SSL: true TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE: false SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/root_cert.crt SSL_CERT_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/postgresql.crt SSL_KEY_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/postgresql.key TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL custom query integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: ALL CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY: >- select 'rows_inserted' as \"metric_name\", 'delta' as \"metric_type\", sd.tup_inserted as \"metric_value\", sd.datid as \"database_id\" from pg_stat_database sd; TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL custom query config file An additional YAML configuration file with one or more custom SQL can be defined and the integration will need the path to the file in the CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG parameter. postgresql-config.yml integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: ALL CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG: \"path/to/postgresql-custom-query.yml\" TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy postgresql-custom-query.yml --- queries: # Metric names are set to the column names in the query results - query: >- SELECT BG.checkpoints_timed AS scheduled_checkpoints_performed, BG.checkpoints_req AS requested_checkpoints_performed, BG.buffers_checkpoint AS buffers_written_during_checkpoint, BG.buffers_clean AS buffers_written_by_background_writer, BG.maxwritten_clean AS background_writer_stops, BG.buffers_backend AS buffers_written_by_backend, BG.buffers_alloc AS buffers_allocated FROM pg_stat_bgwriter BG; # database defaults to the auth database in the main config database: new_frontier_config_dev # If not set explicitly here, metric type will default to # 'gauge' for numbers and 'attribute' for strings metric_types: buffers_allocated: rate # If unset, sample_name defaults to PostgresqlCustomSample sample_name: MyCustomSample Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to these event types: PostgresqlDatabaseSample PostgresqlIndexSample PostgresqlInstanceSample PostgresqlTableSample PgBouncerSample You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The PostgreSQL integration collects the following database metric attributes.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Install and activate To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-mysql. Change the directory to the integration's folder. cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file mysql-config.yml as explained in the next section. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host where PostgreSQL is installed or on a host capable of remotely accessing where PostgreSQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host where PostgreSQL is installed or on a host capable of remotely accessing where PostgreSQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed.

Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to these event types: PostgresqlDatabaseSample PostgresqlIndexSample PostgresqlInstanceSample PostgresqlTableSample PgBouncerSample You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The PostgreSQL integration collects the following database metric attributes.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host where PostgreSQL is installed or on a host capable of remotely accessing where PostgreSQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed.

Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to these event types: PostgresqlDatabaseSample PostgresqlIndexSample PostgresqlInstanceSample PostgresqlTableSample PgBouncerSample You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The PostgreSQL integration collects the following database metric attributes.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host where PostgreSQL is installed or on a host capable of remotely accessing where PostgreSQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed.

Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to these event types: PostgresqlDatabaseSample PostgresqlIndexSample PostgresqlInstanceSample PostgresqlTableSample PgBouncerSample You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The PostgreSQL integration collects the following database metric attributes.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host where PostgreSQL is installed or on a host capable of remotely accessing where PostgreSQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed.

Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to these event types: PostgresqlDatabaseSample PostgresqlIndexSample PostgresqlInstanceSample PostgresqlTableSample PgBouncerSample You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The PostgreSQL integration collects the following database metric attributes.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host where PostgreSQL is installed or on a host capable of remotely accessing where PostgreSQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Tip Want to help make this doc better? Try our beta NGINX monitoring integration doc and give us feedback by creating a GitHub issue. Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL SSL configuration collection file integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' ENABLE_SSL: true TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE: false SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/root_cert.crt SSL_CERT_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/postgresql.crt SSL_KEY_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/postgresql.key TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL custom query integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: ALL CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY: >- select 'rows_inserted' as \"metric_name\", 'delta' as \"metric_type\", sd.tup_inserted as \"metric_value\", sd.datid as \"database_id\" from pg_stat_database sd; TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL custom query config file An additional YAML configuration file with one or more custom SQL can be defined and the integration will need the path to the file in the CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG parameter. postgresql-config.yml integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: ALL CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG: \"path/to/postgresql-custom-query.yml\" TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy postgresql-custom-query.yml --- queries: # Metric names are set to the column names in the query results - query: >- SELECT BG.checkpoints_timed AS scheduled_checkpoints_performed, BG.checkpoints_req AS requested_checkpoints_performed, BG.buffers_checkpoint AS buffers_written_during_checkpoint, BG.buffers_clean AS buffers_written_by_background_writer, BG.maxwritten_clean AS background_writer_stops, BG.buffers_backend AS buffers_written_by_backend, BG.buffers_alloc AS buffers_allocated FROM pg_stat_bgwriter BG; # database defaults to the auth database in the main config database: new_frontier_config_dev # If not set explicitly here, metric type will default to # 'gauge' for numbers and 'attribute' for strings metric_types: buffers_allocated: rate # If unset, sample_name defaults to PostgresqlCustomSample sample_name: MyCustomSample Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to these event types: PostgresqlDatabaseSample PostgresqlIndexSample PostgresqlInstanceSample PostgresqlTableSample PgBouncerSample You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes.

Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX.

      "body": "The Varnish Cache on-host integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Varnish Cache environment to New Relic so you can monitor its health. We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main..

      "body": "Tip Want to help make this doc better? Try our beta MySQL monitoring integration doc and give us feedback by creating a GitHub issue. Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. Quick start Instrument your MySQL database quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the MySQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MySQL database. Install and activate To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes.

Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference.

Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host where PostgreSQL is installed or on a host capable of remotely accessing where PostgreSQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL SSL configuration collection file integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' ENABLE_SSL: true TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE: false SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/root_cert.crt SSL_CERT_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/postgresql.crt SSL_KEY_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/postgresql.key TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL custom query integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: ALL CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY: >- select 'rows_inserted' as \"metric_name\", 'delta' as \"metric_type\", sd.tup_inserted as \"metric_value\", sd.datid as \"database_id\" from pg_stat_database sd; TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL custom query config file An additional YAML configuration file with one or more custom SQL can be defined and the integration will need the path to the file in the CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG parameter. postgresql-config.yml integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: ALL CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG: \"path/to/postgresql-custom-query.yml\" TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy postgresql-custom-query.yml --- queries: # Metric names are set to the column names in the query results - query: >- SELECT BG.checkpoints_timed AS scheduled_checkpoints_performed, BG.checkpoints_req AS requested_checkpoints_performed, BG.buffers_checkpoint AS buffers_written_during_checkpoint, BG.buffers_clean AS buffers_written_by_background_writer, BG.maxwritten_clean AS background_writer_stops, BG.buffers_backend AS buffers_written_by_backend, BG.buffers_alloc AS buffers_allocated FROM pg_stat_bgwriter BG; # database defaults to the auth database in the main config database: new_frontier_config_dev # If not set explicitly here, metric type will default to # 'gauge' for numbers and 'attribute' for strings metric_types: buffers_allocated: rate # If unset, sample_name defaults to PostgresqlCustomSample sample_name: MyCustomSample Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host where PostgreSQL is installed or on a host capable of remotely accessing where PostgreSQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL SSL configuration collection file integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' ENABLE_SSL: true TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE: false SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/root_cert.crt SSL_CERT_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/postgresql.crt SSL_KEY_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/postgresql.key TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL custom query integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: ALL CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY: >- select 'rows_inserted' as \"metric_name\", 'delta' as \"metric_type\", sd.tup_inserted as \"metric_value\", sd.datid as \"database_id\" from pg_stat_database sd; TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL custom query config file An additional YAML configuration file with one or more custom SQL can be defined and the integration will need the path to the file in the CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG parameter. postgresql-config.yml integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: ALL CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG: \"path/to/postgresql-custom-query.yml\" TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy postgresql-custom-query.yml --- queries: # Metric names are set to the column names in the query results - query: >- SELECT BG.checkpoints_timed AS scheduled_checkpoints_performed, BG.checkpoints_req AS requested_checkpoints_performed, BG.buffers_checkpoint AS buffers_written_during_checkpoint, BG.buffers_clean AS buffers_written_by_background_writer, BG.maxwritten_clean AS background_writer_stops, BG.buffers_backend AS buffers_written_by_backend, BG.buffers_alloc AS buffers_allocated FROM pg_stat_bgwriter BG; # database defaults to the auth database in the main config database: new_frontier_config_dev # If not set explicitly here, metric type will default to # 'gauge' for numbers and 'attribute' for strings metric_types: buffers_allocated: rate # If unset, sample_name defaults to PostgresqlCustomSample sample_name: MyCustomSample Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to these event types: PostgresqlDatabaseSample PostgresqlIndexSample PostgresqlInstanceSample PostgresqlTableSample PgBouncerSample You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The PostgreSQL integration collects the following database metric attributes.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host where PostgreSQL is installed or on a host capable of remotely accessing where PostgreSQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL SSL configuration collection file integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' ENABLE_SSL: true TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE: false SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/root_cert.crt SSL_CERT_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/postgresql.crt SSL_KEY_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/postgresql.key TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL custom query integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: ALL CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY: >- select 'rows_inserted' as \"metric_name\", 'delta' as \"metric_type\", sd.tup_inserted as \"metric_value\", sd.datid as \"database_id\" from pg_stat_database sd; TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL custom query config file An additional YAML configuration file with one or more custom SQL can be defined and the integration will need the path to the file in the CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG parameter. postgresql-config.yml integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: ALL CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG: \"path/to/postgresql-custom-query.yml\" TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy postgresql-custom-query.yml --- queries: # Metric names are set to the column names in the query results - query: >- SELECT BG.checkpoints_timed AS scheduled_checkpoints_performed, BG.checkpoints_req AS requested_checkpoints_performed, BG.buffers_checkpoint AS buffers_written_during_checkpoint, BG.buffers_clean AS buffers_written_by_background_writer, BG.maxwritten_clean AS background_writer_stops, BG.buffers_backend AS buffers_written_by_backend, BG.buffers_alloc AS buffers_allocated FROM pg_stat_bgwriter BG; # database defaults to the auth database in the main config database: new_frontier_config_dev # If not set explicitly here, metric type will default to # 'gauge' for numbers and 'attribute' for strings metric_types: buffers_allocated: rate # If unset, sample_name defaults to PostgresqlCustomSample sample_name: MyCustomSample Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to these event types: PostgresqlDatabaseSample PostgresqlIndexSample PostgresqlInstanceSample PostgresqlTableSample PgBouncerSample You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The PostgreSQL integration collects the following database metric attributes.

Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "The Varnish Cache on-host integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Varnish Cache environment to New Relic so you can monitor its health. We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main..

      "body": "Tip Want to help make this doc better? Try our beta MySQL monitoring integration doc and give us feedback by creating a GitHub issue. Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. Quick start Instrument your MySQL database quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the MySQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MySQL database. Install and activate To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-mysql. Change the directory to the integration's folder. cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file mysql-config.yml as explained in the next section. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled.

N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. Quick start Instrument your MySQL database quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the MySQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MySQL database. Install and activate To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-mysql. Change the directory to the integration's folder. cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file mysql-config.yml as explained in the next section. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL.

This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. Quick start Instrument your MySQL database quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the MySQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MySQL database. Install and activate To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-mysql. Change the directory to the integration's folder. cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file mysql-config.yml as explained in the next section. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file.

This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Tip Want to help make this doc better? Try our beta NGINX monitoring integration doc and give us feedback by creating a GitHub issue. Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. Quick start Instrument your MySQL database quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the MySQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MySQL database. Install and activate To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-mysql. Change the directory to the integration's folder. cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file mysql-config.yml as explained in the next section. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "The Varnish Cache on-host integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Varnish Cache environment to New Relic so you can monitor its health. We collect metrics at the instance, lock, memory pool, storage, and backend levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Varnish Cache 1.0 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with our infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Varnish Cache environment quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the Varnish Cache integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your Varnish Cache environment. Install and activate To install the Varnish Cache integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-varnish. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main..

If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. Quick start Instrument your MySQL database quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the MySQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MySQL database. Install and activate To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-mysql. Change the directory to the integration's folder. cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file mysql-config.yml as explained in the next section. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host where PostgreSQL is installed or on a host capable of remotely accessing where PostgreSQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started?

But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MySQL database. Install and activate To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-mysql. Change the directory to the integration's folder. cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file mysql-config.yml as explained in the next section. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host where PostgreSQL is installed or on a host capable of remotely accessing where PostgreSQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL SSL configuration collection file integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' ENABLE_SSL: true TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE: false SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/root_cert.crt SSL_CERT_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/postgresql.crt SSL_KEY_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/postgresql.key TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL custom query integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: ALL CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY: >- select 'rows_inserted' as \"metric_name\", 'delta' as \"metric_type\", sd.tup_inserted as \"metric_value\", sd.datid as \"database_id\" from pg_stat_database sd; TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL custom query config file An additional YAML configuration file with one or more custom SQL can be defined and the integration will need the path to the file in the CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG parameter. postgresql-config.yml integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: ALL CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG: \"path/to/postgresql-custom-query.yml\" TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy postgresql-custom-query.yml --- queries: # Metric names are set to the column names in the query results - query: >- SELECT BG.checkpoints_timed AS scheduled_checkpoints_performed, BG.checkpoints_req AS requested_checkpoints_performed, BG.buffers_checkpoint AS buffers_written_during_checkpoint, BG.buffers_clean AS buffers_written_by_background_writer, BG.maxwritten_clean AS background_writer_stops, BG.buffers_backend AS buffers_written_by_backend, BG.buffers_alloc AS buffers_allocated FROM pg_stat_bgwriter BG; # database defaults to the auth database in the main config database: new_frontier_config_dev # If not set explicitly here, metric type will default to # 'gauge' for numbers and 'attribute' for strings metric_types: buffers_allocated: rate # If unset, sample_name defaults to PostgresqlCustomSample sample_name: MyCustomSample Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to these event types: PostgresqlDatabaseSample PostgresqlIndexSample PostgresqlInstanceSample PostgresqlTableSample PgBouncerSample You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The PostgreSQL integration collects the following database metric attributes.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Install and activate To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-mysql. Change the directory to the integration's folder. cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file mysql-config.yml as explained in the next section. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host where PostgreSQL is installed or on a host capable of remotely accessing where PostgreSQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host where PostgreSQL is installed or on a host capable of remotely accessing where PostgreSQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed.

Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to these event types: PostgresqlDatabaseSample PostgresqlIndexSample PostgresqlInstanceSample PostgresqlTableSample PgBouncerSample You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The PostgreSQL integration collects the following database metric attributes.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host where PostgreSQL is installed or on a host capable of remotely accessing where PostgreSQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed.

Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to these event types: PostgresqlDatabaseSample PostgresqlIndexSample PostgresqlInstanceSample PostgresqlTableSample PgBouncerSample You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The PostgreSQL integration collects the following database metric attributes.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host where PostgreSQL is installed or on a host capable of remotely accessing where PostgreSQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed.

Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to these event types: PostgresqlDatabaseSample PostgresqlIndexSample PostgresqlInstanceSample PostgresqlTableSample PgBouncerSample You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The PostgreSQL integration collects the following database metric attributes.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host where PostgreSQL is installed or on a host capable of remotely accessing where PostgreSQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed.

Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to these event types: PostgresqlDatabaseSample PostgresqlIndexSample PostgresqlInstanceSample PostgresqlTableSample PgBouncerSample You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The PostgreSQL integration collects the following database metric attributes.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host where PostgreSQL is installed or on a host capable of remotely accessing where PostgreSQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed.

Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to these event types: PostgresqlDatabaseSample PostgresqlIndexSample PostgresqlInstanceSample PostgresqlTableSample PgBouncerSample You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The PostgreSQL integration collects the following database metric attributes.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Tip Want to help make this doc better? Try our beta NGINX monitoring integration doc and give us feedback by creating a GitHub issue. Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

What you need Enable this feature for a service Details about how configuration works For an example of how to monitor Redis running on a Kubernetes PHP Guestbook, see this tutorial. What you need To monitor services running on Kubernetes, you only need a Kubernetes cluster running the Kubernetes integration, version 1.16.0 or higher (install | check version | update). We support the following services running on Kubernetes: Apache (does not report inventory data) Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ (does not report inventory data) Redis SNMP Enable monitoring of services To enable our Kubernetes integration to monitor one or more services: Expand this dropdown and get the YAML snippets for the service(s) you want to monitor: Get the config YAML for the integration For the services you want to monitor, follow the links to GitHub to get the YAML snippets you'll need for the next step: Apache Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ Redis SNMP Add the snippet to the Kubernetes integration's ConfigMap, after the data: section: Example configuration This example shows the YAML config for the Apache integration ( highlighted ) added to the Kubernetes integration's config.

See an example. Depending on your environment, you may need or want to set additional config options. Expand the dropdown below for links to configuration options. Configuration options for each integration Select a service to see available config options: Apache Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ Redis SNMP Verify monitoring is enabled: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure, select Third party services, and then select the service's dashboard. You should see data being reported. Additional notes about enabling services: Enabling multiple services may use more resources than what is set in the resource limits of the Kubernetes integration config file. If this becomes an issue, raise the limit in the resources section. The Kubernetes integration does not automatically update. For best results, regularly update. Monitor services in our Kubernetes integration installed with Helm If you installed our Kubernetes integration using Helm, to monitor services you need to update the existing installation with the new configuration, which contains the services to monitor: helm upgrade --reuse-values -f values.yaml [RELEASE] [CHART] Copy If you use nri-bundle charts, you need to update the children's chart values. Find some examples here. Learn more More resources for learning about configuration: Learn technical details about how configuration works. Learn how to configure monitoring of multiple services with the same config file. See a step-by-step tutorial showing how to monitor a Redis service on Kubernetes. Manually configure service monitoring The enable procedure should be all you need to get monitoring working, but if you run into problems, understanding some technical details about configuration can be helpful. This section goes into more detail about how configuration works. For each service you wish to monitor, you must add a configuration file for that integration to our Kubernetes integration's configuration. This document will cover these subjects: How the service-specific configuration YAML snippet works Adding the service-specific YAML in the Kubernetes integration's config file Adding multiple services to the Kubernetes integration's config file How the service-specific YAML config works Our Kubernetes integration's configuration follows the ConfigMap format. Using a ConfigMap allows us to decouple the configuration for the integrations from the Kubernetes image. The other benefit is that a ConfigMap can be updated automatically without reloading the running container. Because the infrastructure agent uses YAML to configure its associated integrations, ConfigMaps are a good choice for storing YAML. (For more information on config file format, see the Integration config file format.) The Kubernetes integration image comes with an auto-discovery feature that simplifies the configuration of multiple instances of services using a single configuration file. For example, if you have several NGINX instances running, creating an NGINX integration configuration file for every instance would be hard to implement and hard to update. With our auto-discovery option, you can discover and monitor all your NGINX instances with a single configuration file. Each integration has its own specific configuration YAML. Our NGINX integration default config file looks like this: nginx-config.yml: | --- discovery: command: # Use the following optional arguments : # --namespaces: Comma separated list of namespaces to discover pods on # --port: Port used to connect to the kubelet. Default is 10255 # --tls: Use secure (TLS) connection # Custom Example: # exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes --namespaces namespace1,namespace2 --port 10250 --tls # Default exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes match: label.app: nginx integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://${discovery.ip}/status STATUS_MODULE: discover METRICS: 1 Copy The above config enables the following: Runs nri-discovery-kubernetes to query the data for the node we are currently on. Parses the data that comes back and looks for any Kubernetes pod that has a Kubernetes container with an app= label with value nginx. For any matches, it attempts to run the NGINX integration. The status URL is built from: The pod's IP address The status page is pulled from the label on K8s pod called status_url This automatic discovery works the same as the container auto-discovery used by the infrastructure agent. For more advanced options, see Container auto-discovery. Add a service YAML to the Kubernetes integration config It's best practice to configure enabled integrations alongside the Kubernetes integration configuration. This is easier than maintaining configuration files for every single service/integration instance. Below is an example of a Kubernetes integration's ConfigMap. The highlighted section shows where an integration configuration YAML (in this case, NGINX) is placed. For more information on discovery:, see Container auto-discovery for on-host integrations. --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: nginx-config.yml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=nginx\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Use the following optional arguments : # --namespaces: Comma separated list of namespaces to discover pods on # --tls: Use secure (TLS) connection # --port: Port used to connect to the kubelet. Default is 10255 exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes --port PORT --tls match: label.app: nginx integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: # If you're using ngx_http_api_module be certain to use the full path up to and including the version number # Use the discovered IP as the host address STATUS_URL: http://${discovery.ip}/status # Comma separated list of ngx_http_api_module, NON PARAMETERIZED, Endpoints # endpoints: /nginx,/processes,/connections,/ssl,/slabs,/http,/http/requests,/http/server_zones,/http/caches,/http/upstreams,/http/keyvals,/stream,/stream/server_zones,/stream/upstreams,/stream/keyvals,/stream/zone_sync # Name of Nginx status module OHI is to query against. discover | ngx_http_stub_status_module | ngx_http_status_module | ngx_http_api_module STATUS_MODULE: discover METRICS: 1 Copy This configuration map can then be referenced in the DaemonSet, the same as the one that was generated via the command line. Make sure the namespace used is the same one used by the Kubernetes integration manifest. If you haven't changed it in the downloaded manifest file, the value is default. Add multiple services to the same config You can monitor several services using the same Kubernetes integration config file. To do this, add another integration configuration YAML to the same Kubernetes integration config file. Below is the Kubernetes config created in the last section, with a new section for the Cassandra integration's config (highlighted). --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: nginx-config.yml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=nginx\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Run discovery for Kubernetes.

      "body": "Our custom installation process for the infrastructure agent for Windows allows you to tailor all aspects of the installation. You can place files and folders wherever you want on your filesystem. This method gives you full control of the installation. You are responsible for placing the files in the correct folders, providing the correct configuration values, and ensuring the agent has all the right permissions. Before installation, check the compatibility and requirements. Install the agent To install the agent: Download the packaged agent file. Unpack the file. Make sure the file unpacks with the following structure: Install the service script. Optionally, you can: Change the location of the configuration file. Configure the plugin directory. Configure the agent directory. Configure the log file. Important As of version 1.4.0, the infrastructure agent package includes the additional newrelic-infra-ctl binary, which is used to help troubleshoot a running agent. Although this binary is not required to execute the agent, we recommend to add it in your path. For more information, see our documentation about troubleshooting a running infrastructure agent. Install the service script To proceed with the installation, you need to create the service. Check the file provided in the zip file for reference: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\installer.ps1 Copy Configuration file The infrastructure agent depends on a configuration file, usually named newrelic-infra.yml, to configure the agent's behavior. This file is placed in the same folder with the agent. You can create a new config file based on the config file template. For more information, see how to configure the agent. Changing the config file's location By default, the configuration file is located in C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.yml. To change the location of the configuration file: Execute the command regedit.exe. Browse to the folder Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\newrelic-infra\\ImagePath. Retrieve the ImagePath key. If the agent binary is on the default path, look for the key at C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.exe. Use the -config flag to add the new location of the configuration file to the key: C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.exe -config c:\\config.yaml Copy Configure the plugin directory The infrastructure agent allows you to install integrations that monitor and report data from popular services such as Kubernetes, AWS, MySQL, Redis, Kafka, etc. Each integration has its own configuration file, named integration-name-config.yml by default. This config file is placed in the predefined location C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d. On initialization, the agent loads the config file. To overwrite the predefined location of the integration configuration file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_PLUGIN_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the plugin_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -plugin_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the agent directory The agent requires its own defined directory to run the installed integrations, caching data (inventory), etc. The default location is C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\. The agent directory has the following structure and content: LICENSE: Text file containing the New Relic infrastructure agent license. custom-integrations: Directory that stores the installed the custom integrations. newrelic-integrations: Directory that stores the New Relic official integrations. The agent also uses a different folder, app_data_dir, to store data. By default it points to C:\\ProgramData\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\. To overwrite the predefined location of the agent directory, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_AGENT_DIR environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the agent_dir field. Pass it as a command line argument using -agent_dir when you run the newrelic-infra binary. Configure the log file By default the agent stores the log files in C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\newrelic-infra.log. To overwrite the predefined location of the log file, use one of the following methods: Set the location in the NRIA_LOG_FILE environment variable. Set the custom path in the newrelic-infra.yml configuration file using the log_file field. Pass it as a command line argument using -log_file when you run the newrelic-infra binary. What's next? You may also want to: Add custom attributes to annotate your infrastructure data. Connect your AWS account if your servers are hosted on Amazon EC2. Add other New Relic infrastructure integrations to collect data from external services. Manually start, stop, restart, or check the agent status.",

      "body": "Tip Want to help make this doc better? Try our beta MySQL monitoring integration doc and give us feedback by creating a GitHub issue. Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. Quick start Instrument your MySQL database quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the MySQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MySQL database. Install and activate To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-mysql. Change the directory to the integration's folder. cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file mysql-config.yml as explained in the next section. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host where PostgreSQL is installed or on a host capable of remotely accessing where PostgreSQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL SSL configuration collection file integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' ENABLE_SSL: true TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE: false SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/root_cert.crt SSL_CERT_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/postgresql.crt SSL_KEY_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/postgresql.key TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL custom query integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: ALL CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY: >- select 'rows_inserted' as \"metric_name\", 'delta' as \"metric_type\", sd.tup_inserted as \"metric_value\", sd.datid as \"database_id\" from pg_stat_database sd; TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL custom query config file An additional YAML configuration file with one or more custom SQL can be defined and the integration will need the path to the file in the CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG parameter. postgresql-config.yml integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: ALL CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG: \"path/to/postgresql-custom-query.yml\" TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy postgresql-custom-query.yml --- queries: # Metric names are set to the column names in the query results - query: >- SELECT BG.checkpoints_timed AS scheduled_checkpoints_performed, BG.checkpoints_req AS requested_checkpoints_performed, BG.buffers_checkpoint AS buffers_written_during_checkpoint, BG.buffers_clean AS buffers_written_by_background_writer, BG.maxwritten_clean AS background_writer_stops, BG.buffers_backend AS buffers_written_by_backend, BG.buffers_alloc AS buffers_allocated FROM pg_stat_bgwriter BG; # database defaults to the auth database in the main config database: new_frontier_config_dev # If not set explicitly here, metric type will default to # 'gauge' for numbers and 'attribute' for strings metric_types: buffers_allocated: rate # If unset, sample_name defaults to PostgresqlCustomSample sample_name: MyCustomSample Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our NGINX integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your NGINX server to our platform, where you can see data on connections and client requests so that you can find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with both NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. NGINX extension enabled, as described in the Configure the integration section. If NGINX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a Linux OS host that's running NGINX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your NGINX server quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the NGINX integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your NGINX server. Install and activate the integration To install the NGINX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the general instructions for installing an integration, using the filename nri-nginx. Then continue on to the steps below. Change the directory to the integrations configuration folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp nginx-config.yml.sample nginx-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file nginx-config.yml. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your NGINX Server To capture data from the NGINX integration, you must first enable and configure the applicable extension module: For NGINX Open Source: HTTP stub status module For NGINX Plus: HTTP status module and HTTP API module Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to NGINX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your NGINX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. NGINX Instance Settings The NGINX integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To STATUS_URL The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. http://127.0.0.1/status Metrics/Inventory STATUS_MODULE Name of NGINX status module. Valid options are: discover ngx_http_stub_status_module ngx_http_status_module ngx_http_api_module\" discover Metrics CONNECTION_TIMEOUT Connection timeout to the NGINX instance in seconds. 5 Metrics VALIDATE_CERTS Set to false if the status URL is HTTPS with a self-signed certificate. true Metrics CONFIG_PATH The path to the NGINX configuration file. N/A Inventory REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here or see example below. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations BASIC CONFIGURATION This is the very basic configuration to collect Metrics and Inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy HTTP BASIC AUTHENTICATION This configuration collects Metrics and Inventory from your localhost protected with basic authentication. Replace the username and password on the STATUS_URL with your credentials: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status STATUS_MODULE: discover REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://username:password@127.0.0.1/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx Copy METRICS ONLY WITH SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATE In this configuration we only have 1 integration block with METRICS: true to collect only metrics and added VALIDATE_CERTS: false to prevent validation of the server's SSL certificate when using a self-signed one: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://my_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES REPLACEMENT In this configuration we are using the environment variable NGINX_STATUS to populate the STATUS_URL setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: {{NGINX_STATUS}} STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy MULTI-INSTANCE MONITORING In this configuration we are monitoring multiple NGINX servers from the same integration. For the first instance (STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status) we are collecting metrics and inventory while for the second instance (STATUS_URL: https://2nd_nginx_host/status) we will only collect metrics. integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-nginx env: INVENTORY: \"true\" STATUS_URL: https://1st_nginx_host/status CONFIG_PATH: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/nginx - name: nri-nginx env: METRICS: \"true\" STATUS_URL: http://2nd_nginx_host/status STATUS_MODULE: discover VALIDATE_CERTS: false REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the NginxSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metrics The NGINX integration collects the following metric data attributes. To find these attributes, query the NginxSample event type. NGINX Open Source Metric Description net.connectionsActive Number of connections that are currently active net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Number of accepted client connections per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Number of connections per second that were accepted but could not he handled and hence dropped net.connectionsReading Current number of connections where NGINX is reading the request header net.connectionsWaiting Current number of idle client connections waiting for a request net.connectionsWriting Current number of connections where NGINX is writing the response back to the client net.requestsPerSecond Total number of client requests per second NGINX Plus Our integration retrieves all available metric data from the following HTTP API endpoints: /nginx, /processes, /connections, /http/requests, and /ssl. Metric Description net.connectionsAcceptedPerSecond Accepted client connections as requests per second net.connectionsDroppedPerSecond Dropped client connections as requests per second net.connectionsActive Current number of active client connections net.connectionsIdle Current number of idle client connections net.requests Current number of requests net.requestsPerSecond Current number of requests per second processes.respawned Current number of abnormally terminated and respawned child processes ssl.handshakes Current number for successful SSL handshakes ssl.failedHandshakes Current number of failed SSL handshakes ssl.sessionReuses Current number of session reuses during SSL handshake Inventory data The integration captures configuration options defined in the NGINX master config file (usually nginx.conf). Tip The master NGINX config file can contain \"include OTHER_FILE_NAME\" commands for splitting the configuration into multiple files. The Infrastructure agent ignores (does not parse) configuration set via include commands. System metadata The integration collects these additional attributes about the NGINX service: Name Description software.edition The NGINX edition: either \"open source\" or \"plus\". software.version The version of NGINX. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS.

Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with any existing service that conform to the Nagios Plugin API. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows OS version compatible with New Relic's infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Nagios instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Nagios integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-nagios. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp nagios-config.yml.sample nagios-config.yml Copy Create a copy of the sample service checks file by running: sudo cp nagios-service-checks.yml.sample nagios-service-checks.yml Copy Edit the nagios-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-nagios .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-nagios/nri-nagios-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-nagios-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp nagios-config.yml.sample nagios-config.yml Copy Edit the nagios-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a nagios-service-checks.yml file that describes the service checks to be run by the integration. For an example configuration, see the example service checks file. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the Infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For example configurations, see the nagios-config.yml and nagios-service-checks.yml examples. Our configuration files have common settings used in all of our integrations, such as interval, timeout, andinventory_source, among others. For more on these common settings, see this list of configuration properties. Specific settings related to Nagios are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Nagios instance as well as other security settings and features. Nagios instance settings Setting Description Default SERVICE_CHECKS_CONFIG This points to a yaml file containing definitions of the service checks that will be run by the integration. Required. N/A CONCURRENCY The number of service checks to be run concurrently. 1 OUTPUT_TABLE_NAME The name of the table where the service check results are saved. NagiosServiceCheckSample Service checks config file The service_checks_config yaml file contains the top-level array service_checks. Each service check must contain both a name and a command. Key Description name The naming convention is not specific, and allows for easy recognition in the Infrastructure UI. command The command is an array of strings, with the first position containing the path to the executable and the remaining positions containing the arguments to the executable. labels A collection of key: value pairs which help to identify and group service checks in Insights. parse_output Attempts to parse the output of service checks that conform to the Nagios Plugin API spec. Default: false. These setting values can be defined in several ways: Add the values directly in the config file. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires Infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text in the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels/custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control configuration settings, such as your license key, and are then passed to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use the passthrough feature, see configure the Infrastructure agent. You can also decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics. You can use these labels to query, filter, or group your metrics. Our default sample config file includes examples with labels, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: nagios Copy Permissions Non-configurable commands are run by the infrastructure agent, which itself is run by the root user. For the integration to run properly, ensure that the permissions on the yaml file are appropriately restrictive as indicated below: Linux permissions Set the user permissions flag to 0600, restricting read and write privileges to the file owner. If permissions do not meet this requirement, an error will be logged and the integration will fail to run. Windows permissions By default, the agent and any commands in the yaml file run as an Administrator. As the integration is unable to check permissions, it is up to the user to appropriately restrict permissions for the file. Example configurations Example file configurations: Example nagios-config.yml configuration integrations: - name: nri-nagios env: CONCURRENCY: \"1\" SERVICE_CHECKS_CONFIG: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/nagios-service-checks.yml interval: 15s Copy Example nagios-service-checks.yml configuration service_checks: - name: check_users command: [\"/usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_users\", \"-w\", \"5\", \"-c\", \"10\"] parse_output: true labels: env: staging key1: val1 - name: check_yum command: [\"/usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_yum\"] Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Nagios integration links. Nagios data is attached to the NagiosServiceCheckSample event type. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Nagios integration collects the following metric data attributes. Nagios service check sample metrics These attributes can be found by querying the NagiosServiceCheckSample event types in Insights. Metric Description serviceCheck.command The command used to run the service check. serviceCheck.error The standard error (stderr) output of the service check. serviceCheck.longServiceOutput The portion of the message that is parsed by Nagios as $LONGSERVICEOUTPUT$. Only enabled if parse_output is set. serviceCheck.message The standard output (stdout) of the service check. serviceCheck.name The descriptive name of the service check being performed. serviceCheck.serviceOutput The portion of the message that is parsed by Nagios as $SERVICEOUTPUT$. Only enabled if parse_output is set. serviceCheck.status The return code of the service check. Options: 0 = Ok 1 = Warning 2 = Critical 3 = Unknown * Any additional metrics defined and reported by the service check. Only enabled if parse_output is set. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Config parsing failed error The following error appears in the log file: Config parsing failed: service checks file permissions are not restrictive enough. Required file permissions are 0600. See documentation for details Copy Solution: Set the user permissions flag to 0600, restricting read and write privileges to the file owner. Cause: If the file is not owned by the root user or the file can be written to by a user other than the root user, the integration will allow users to run arbitrary commands as though they are a root user. If permissions do not meet the requirement, an error will be logged and the integration will fail to run. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-varnish .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-varnish/nri-varnish-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-varnish-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp varnish-config.yml.sample varnish-config.yml Copy Edit the varnish-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings, refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to Varnish are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Varnish instance, as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the following section. Varnish Cache instance settings The Varnish Cache integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To INSTANCE_NAME User defined name to identify data from this instance in New Relic. Required. N/A M/I PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE The location of the varnish.params config file. If this argument is omitted, the following locations will be checked: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params /etc/sysconfig/varnish/varnish.params Note: The location and name of the Varnish configuration file may vary. For details, see Different locations of the Varnish configuration file. N/A I VARNISH_NAME Name used when executing the varnishd daemon with a custom -n flag. Optional. N/A M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The varnish-config.yml commands accept the following arguments: The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main..

      "body": "Tip Want to help make this doc better? Try our beta MySQL monitoring integration doc and give us feedback by creating a GitHub issue. Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. Quick start Instrument your MySQL database quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the MySQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MySQL database. Install and activate To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-mysql. Change the directory to the integration's folder. cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file mysql-config.yml as explained in the next section. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the MysqlSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The MySQL integration collects the following metrics: Default metrics These metrics are captured by default: Name Description cluster.slaveRunning Boolean. 1 if this server is a replication slave that is connected to a replication master, and both the I/O and SQL threads are running; otherwise, it is 0.

      "body": "Our Nagios integration lets you use your service checks directly, without the need to run a Nagios instance. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with any existing service that conform to the Nagios Plugin API. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows OS version compatible with New Relic's infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Nagios instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Nagios integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-nagios. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp nagios-config.yml.sample nagios-config.yml Copy Create a copy of the sample service checks file by running: sudo cp nagios-service-checks.yml.sample nagios-service-checks.yml Copy Edit the nagios-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-nagios .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-nagios/nri-nagios-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-nagios-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp nagios-config.yml.sample nagios-config.yml Copy Edit the nagios-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a nagios-service-checks.yml file that describes the service checks to be run by the integration. For an example configuration, see the example service checks file. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the Infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For example configurations, see the nagios-config.yml and nagios-service-checks.yml examples. Our configuration files have common settings used in all of our integrations, such as interval, timeout, andinventory_source, among others. For more on these common settings, see this list of configuration properties. Specific settings related to Nagios are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Nagios instance as well as other security settings and features. Nagios instance settings Setting Description Default SERVICE_CHECKS_CONFIG This points to a yaml file containing definitions of the service checks that will be run by the integration. Required. N/A CONCURRENCY The number of service checks to be run concurrently. 1 OUTPUT_TABLE_NAME The name of the table where the service check results are saved. NagiosServiceCheckSample Service checks config file The service_checks_config yaml file contains the top-level array service_checks. Each service check must contain both a name and a command. Key Description name The naming convention is not specific, and allows for easy recognition in the Infrastructure UI. command The command is an array of strings, with the first position containing the path to the executable and the remaining positions containing the arguments to the executable. labels A collection of key: value pairs which help to identify and group service checks in Insights. parse_output Attempts to parse the output of service checks that conform to the Nagios Plugin API spec. Default: false. These setting values can be defined in several ways: Add the values directly in the config file. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires Infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text in the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels/custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control configuration settings, such as your license key, and are then passed to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use the passthrough feature, see configure the Infrastructure agent. You can also decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics. You can use these labels to query, filter, or group your metrics. Our default sample config file includes examples with labels, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: nagios Copy Permissions Non-configurable commands are run by the infrastructure agent, which itself is run by the root user. For the integration to run properly, ensure that the permissions on the yaml file are appropriately restrictive as indicated below: Linux permissions Set the user permissions flag to 0600, restricting read and write privileges to the file owner. If permissions do not meet this requirement, an error will be logged and the integration will fail to run. Windows permissions By default, the agent and any commands in the yaml file run as an Administrator. As the integration is unable to check permissions, it is up to the user to appropriately restrict permissions for the file. Example configurations Example file configurations: Example nagios-config.yml configuration integrations: - name: nri-nagios env: CONCURRENCY: \"1\" SERVICE_CHECKS_CONFIG: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/nagios-service-checks.yml interval: 15s Copy Example nagios-service-checks.yml configuration service_checks: - name: check_users command: [\"/usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_users\", \"-w\", \"5\", \"-c\", \"10\"] parse_output: true labels: env: staging key1: val1 - name: check_yum command: [\"/usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_yum\"] Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Nagios integration links. Nagios data is attached to the NagiosServiceCheckSample event type. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Nagios integration collects the following metric data attributes. Nagios service check sample metrics These attributes can be found by querying the NagiosServiceCheckSample event types in Insights. Metric Description serviceCheck.command The command used to run the service check. serviceCheck.error The standard error (stderr) output of the service check. serviceCheck.longServiceOutput The portion of the message that is parsed by Nagios as $LONGSERVICEOUTPUT$. Only enabled if parse_output is set. serviceCheck.message The standard output (stdout) of the service check. serviceCheck.name The descriptive name of the service check being performed. serviceCheck.serviceOutput The portion of the message that is parsed by Nagios as $SERVICEOUTPUT$. Only enabled if parse_output is set. serviceCheck.status The return code of the service check. Options: 0 = Ok 1 = Warning 2 = Critical 3 = Unknown * Any additional metrics defined and reported by the service check. Only enabled if parse_output is set. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Config parsing failed error The following error appears in the log file: Config parsing failed: service checks file permissions are not restrictive enough. Required file permissions are 0600. See documentation for details Copy Solution: Set the user permissions flag to 0600, restricting read and write privileges to the file owner. Cause: If the file is not owned by the root user or the file can be written to by a user other than the root user, the integration will allow users to run arbitrary commands as though they are a root user. If permissions do not meet the requirement, an error will be logged and the integration will fail to run. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: varnish Copy Example configuration Example varnish-config.yml file configuration: Example configuration This is the very basic configuration to collect metrics and inventory : integrations: - name: nri-varnish env: INSTANCE_NAME: new_relic PARAMS_CONFIG_FILE: /etc/default/varnish/varnish.params interval: 15s labels: env: production role: varnish inventory_source: config/varnish Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data in Infrastructure, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Varnish Cache integration links. In New Relic, Varnish Cache data is attached to the following Insights event type: VarnishSample VarnishLockSample VarnishStorageSample VarnishMempoolSample VarnishBackendSample For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Varnish Cache integration collects the following metric data attributes. Each metric name is prefixed with a category indicator and a period, such as bans. or main.. Tip A number of metrics are calculated as rates (per second) instead of totals as the metric names might suggest. For more details on which metrics are calculated as rates, refer to the spec.csv file. Varnish sample metrics These attributes can be found by querying the VarnishSample event types.

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. Quick start Instrument your MySQL database quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the MySQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MySQL database. Install and activate To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-mysql. Change the directory to the integration's folder. cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file mysql-config.yml as explained in the next section. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the MysqlSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

      "body": "Our Nagios integration lets you use your service checks directly, without the need to run a Nagios instance. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with any existing service that conform to the Nagios Plugin API. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows OS version compatible with New Relic's infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Nagios instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Nagios integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-nagios. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp nagios-config.yml.sample nagios-config.yml Copy Create a copy of the sample service checks file by running: sudo cp nagios-service-checks.yml.sample nagios-service-checks.yml Copy Edit the nagios-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-nagios .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-nagios/nri-nagios-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-nagios-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp nagios-config.yml.sample nagios-config.yml Copy Edit the nagios-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a nagios-service-checks.yml file that describes the service checks to be run by the integration. For an example configuration, see the example service checks file. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the Infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For example configurations, see the nagios-config.yml and nagios-service-checks.yml examples. Our configuration files have common settings used in all of our integrations, such as interval, timeout, andinventory_source, among others. For more on these common settings, see this list of configuration properties. Specific settings related to Nagios are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Nagios instance as well as other security settings and features. Nagios instance settings Setting Description Default SERVICE_CHECKS_CONFIG This points to a yaml file containing definitions of the service checks that will be run by the integration. Required. N/A CONCURRENCY The number of service checks to be run concurrently. 1 OUTPUT_TABLE_NAME The name of the table where the service check results are saved. NagiosServiceCheckSample Service checks config file The service_checks_config yaml file contains the top-level array service_checks. Each service check must contain both a name and a command. Key Description name The naming convention is not specific, and allows for easy recognition in the Infrastructure UI. command The command is an array of strings, with the first position containing the path to the executable and the remaining positions containing the arguments to the executable. labels A collection of key: value pairs which help to identify and group service checks in Insights. parse_output Attempts to parse the output of service checks that conform to the Nagios Plugin API spec. Default: false. These setting values can be defined in several ways: Add the values directly in the config file. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires Infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text in the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels/custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control configuration settings, such as your license key, and are then passed to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use the passthrough feature, see configure the Infrastructure agent. You can also decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics. You can use these labels to query, filter, or group your metrics. Our default sample config file includes examples with labels, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: nagios Copy Permissions Non-configurable commands are run by the infrastructure agent, which itself is run by the root user. For the integration to run properly, ensure that the permissions on the yaml file are appropriately restrictive as indicated below: Linux permissions Set the user permissions flag to 0600, restricting read and write privileges to the file owner. If permissions do not meet this requirement, an error will be logged and the integration will fail to run. Windows permissions By default, the agent and any commands in the yaml file run as an Administrator. As the integration is unable to check permissions, it is up to the user to appropriately restrict permissions for the file. Example configurations Example file configurations: Example nagios-config.yml configuration integrations: - name: nri-nagios env: CONCURRENCY: \"1\" SERVICE_CHECKS_CONFIG: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/nagios-service-checks.yml interval: 15s Copy Example nagios-service-checks.yml configuration service_checks: - name: check_users command: [\"/usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_users\", \"-w\", \"5\", \"-c\", \"10\"] parse_output: true labels: env: staging key1: val1 - name: check_yum command: [\"/usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_yum\"] Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Nagios integration links. Nagios data is attached to the NagiosServiceCheckSample event type. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Nagios integration collects the following metric data attributes. Nagios service check sample metrics These attributes can be found by querying the NagiosServiceCheckSample event types in Insights. Metric Description serviceCheck.command The command used to run the service check. serviceCheck.error The standard error (stderr) output of the service check. serviceCheck.longServiceOutput The portion of the message that is parsed by Nagios as $LONGSERVICEOUTPUT$. Only enabled if parse_output is set. serviceCheck.message The standard output (stdout) of the service check. serviceCheck.name The descriptive name of the service check being performed. serviceCheck.serviceOutput The portion of the message that is parsed by Nagios as $SERVICEOUTPUT$. Only enabled if parse_output is set. serviceCheck.status The return code of the service check. Options: 0 = Ok 1 = Warning 2 = Critical 3 = Unknown * Any additional metrics defined and reported by the service check. Only enabled if parse_output is set. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Config parsing failed error The following error appears in the log file: Config parsing failed: service checks file permissions are not restrictive enough. Required file permissions are 0600. See documentation for details Copy Solution: Set the user permissions flag to 0600, restricting read and write privileges to the file owner. Cause: If the file is not owned by the root user or the file can be written to by a user other than the root user, the integration will allow users to run arbitrary commands as though they are a root user. If permissions do not meet the requirement, an error will be logged and the integration will fail to run. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. Quick start Instrument your MySQL database quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the MySQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MySQL database. Install and activate To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-mysql. Change the directory to the integration's folder. cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file mysql-config.yml as explained in the next section. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "Our Nagios integration lets you use your service checks directly, without the need to run a Nagios instance. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with any existing service that conform to the Nagios Plugin API. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows OS version compatible with New Relic's infrastructure agent. Quick start Instrument your Nagios instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these buttons to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Install and activate To install the Nagios integration: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-nagios. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp nagios-config.yml.sample nagios-config.yml Copy Create a copy of the sample service checks file by running: sudo cp nagios-service-checks.yml.sample nagios-service-checks.yml Copy Edit the nagios-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-nagios .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-nagios/nri-nagios-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-nagios-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp nagios-config.yml.sample nagios-config.yml Copy Edit the nagios-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a nagios-service-checks.yml file that describes the service checks to be run by the integration. For an example configuration, see the example service checks file. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the Infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. For example configurations, see the nagios-config.yml and nagios-service-checks.yml examples. Our configuration files have common settings used in all of our integrations, such as interval, timeout, andinventory_source, among others. For more on these common settings, see this list of configuration properties. Specific settings related to Nagios are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your Nagios instance as well as other security settings and features. Nagios instance settings Setting Description Default SERVICE_CHECKS_CONFIG This points to a yaml file containing definitions of the service checks that will be run by the integration. Required. N/A CONCURRENCY The number of service checks to be run concurrently. 1 OUTPUT_TABLE_NAME The name of the table where the service check results are saved. NagiosServiceCheckSample Service checks config file The service_checks_config yaml file contains the top-level array service_checks. Each service check must contain both a name and a command. Key Description name The naming convention is not specific, and allows for easy recognition in the Infrastructure UI. command The command is an array of strings, with the first position containing the path to the executable and the remaining positions containing the arguments to the executable. labels A collection of key: value pairs which help to identify and group service checks in Insights. parse_output Attempts to parse the output of service checks that conform to the Nagios Plugin API spec. Default: false. These setting values can be defined in several ways: Add the values directly in the config file. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires Infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text in the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels/custom attributes Environment variables can be used to control configuration settings, such as your license key, and are then passed to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use the passthrough feature, see configure the Infrastructure agent. You can also decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics. You can use these labels to query, filter, or group your metrics. Our default sample config file includes examples with labels, you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: nagios Copy Permissions Non-configurable commands are run by the infrastructure agent, which itself is run by the root user. For the integration to run properly, ensure that the permissions on the yaml file are appropriately restrictive as indicated below: Linux permissions Set the user permissions flag to 0600, restricting read and write privileges to the file owner. If permissions do not meet this requirement, an error will be logged and the integration will fail to run. Windows permissions By default, the agent and any commands in the yaml file run as an Administrator. As the integration is unable to check permissions, it is up to the user to appropriately restrict permissions for the file. Example configurations Example file configurations: Example nagios-config.yml configuration integrations: - name: nri-nagios env: CONCURRENCY: \"1\" SERVICE_CHECKS_CONFIG: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/nagios-service-checks.yml interval: 15s Copy Example nagios-service-checks.yml configuration service_checks: - name: check_users command: [\"/usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_users\", \"-w\", \"5\", \"-c\", \"10\"] parse_output: true labels: env: staging key1: val1 - name: check_yum command: [\"/usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_yum\"] Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Find and use data To find your integration data go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the Nagios integration links. Nagios data is attached to the NagiosServiceCheckSample event type. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The Nagios integration collects the following metric data attributes. Nagios service check sample metrics These attributes can be found by querying the NagiosServiceCheckSample event types in Insights. Metric Description serviceCheck.command The command used to run the service check. serviceCheck.error The standard error (stderr) output of the service check. serviceCheck.longServiceOutput The portion of the message that is parsed by Nagios as $LONGSERVICEOUTPUT$. Only enabled if parse_output is set. serviceCheck.message The standard output (stdout) of the service check. serviceCheck.name The descriptive name of the service check being performed. serviceCheck.serviceOutput The portion of the message that is parsed by Nagios as $SERVICEOUTPUT$. Only enabled if parse_output is set. serviceCheck.status The return code of the service check. Options: 0 = Ok 1 = Warning 2 = Critical 3 = Unknown * Any additional metrics defined and reported by the service check. Only enabled if parse_output is set. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Config parsing failed error The following error appears in the log file: Config parsing failed: service checks file permissions are not restrictive enough. Required file permissions are 0600. See documentation for details Copy Solution: Set the user permissions flag to 0600, restricting read and write privileges to the file owner. Cause: If the file is not owned by the root user or the file can be written to by a user other than the root user, the integration will allow users to run arbitrary commands as though they are a root user. If permissions do not meet the requirement, an error will be logged and the integration will fail to run. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our F5 BIG-IP integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your F5 BIG-IP instance to our platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. We collect data at the system, application, pool, pool member, virtual server, and node levels. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with F5 BIG-IP 11.6 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: Install the infrastructure agent. Linux distribution or Windows version compatible with the infrastructure agent. F5 BIG-IP user account with Auditor-level access user privileges and iControl REST API access permissions. Install and activate To install the F5 BIG-IP integration, choose your setup: Linux installation Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-f5. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp f5-config.yml.sample f5-config.yml Copy Edit the f5-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows installation Download the nri-f5 MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-f5/nri-f5-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-f5-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: copy f5-config.yml.sample f5-config.yml Copy Edit the f5-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: We recommend you install the integration on a separate server and monitor F5 remotely. Advanced: It's also possible to install the integration from a tarball file. This gives you full control over the installation and configuration process. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Enable your F5 instance Create a new F5 BIG-IP user and assign user permissions: Create a user account with, at minimum, Auditor-level access permissions. For instructions on how to do this, see the official F5 documentation. Once the user has been created, assign the user iControl REST user permissions. Tip Administrator-level permissions may be required to collect some system sample metrics or system inventory configuration data. For more information on user permission levels, see the official F5 documentation on user role access descriptions. Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes, see monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS, see monitor services running on ECS. If installed via on-host, edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, f5-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. The options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, and inventory_source, among others. For more on these common settings, see our list of configuration properties document. If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, see on-host integrations standard configuration format. Specific settings related to F5 are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your F5 instance, as well as other security settings and features. F5 instance settings The F5 integration collects both metrics(M) and inventory(I) information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies to HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where F5 is running. localhost M/I PORT Port on which F5 API is listening. 443 M/I USERNAME Username for accessing F5 API. N/A M/I PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A M/I CA_BUNDLE_FILE Location of SSL certificate on the host. Only required if USE_SSL is true. N/A M/I CA_BUNDLE_DIR Alternative Certificate Authority bundle directory. N/A M/I TIMEOUT Timeout for requests, in seconds. 30 M/I PARTITION_FILTER A JSON array of BIG-IP partitions to collect from. See this metrics-only with partition filtering example. [\"Common\"] M MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS Maximum number of requests running concurrently. 10 M METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false You can define these setting values in different ways, depending on your preference and need: Add the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires Infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more on using passthrough or see the environment variables replacement example. Use secrets management to protect sensitive information, such as passwords, that would be exposed in plain text in the configuration file. For more information, read more about using secrets management. Labels/custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter, or group your metrics. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels. You can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-f5 env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 443 USERNAME: f5_user PASSWORD: f5_password interval: 15s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/f5 Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 15 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-f5 env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 443 USERNAME: f5_user PASSWORD: f5_password interval: 15s labels: environment: production - name: nri-f5 env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 443 USERNAME: f5_user PASSWORD: f5_password interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/f5 Copy Environment variables replacement In this configuration, the environment variable F5_HOST populates the HOSTNAME setting of the integration: integrations: - name: nri-f5 env: METRICS: \"true\" HOSTNAME: {{F5_HOST}} PORT: 443 USERNAME: f5_user PASSWORD: f5_password interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Metrics-only with partition filtering This configuration only collects metrics and adds \"MyOtherPartition\" to the list of partitions to be sampled. By default, the integration only samples the \"Common\" partition: integrations: - name: nri-f5 env: METRICS: \"true\" HOSTNAME: {{F5_HOST}} PORT: 443 USERNAME: f5_user PASSWORD: f5_password PARTITION_FILTER: '[\"Common\",\"MyOtherPartition\"]' interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Multi-instance monitoring This configuration monitors multiple F5 servers from the same integration. The first instance (HOSTNAME: 1st_f5_host) collects metrics and inventory, while the second instance (HOSTNAME: 2nd_f5_host) only collects metrics. integrations: - name: nri-f5 env: METRICS: \"true\" HOSTNAME: 1st_f5_host PORT: 443 USERNAME: f5_user PASSWORD: f5_password interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer - name: nri-f5 env: INVENTORY: \"true\" HOSTNAME: 1st_f5_host PORT: 443 USERNAME: f5_user PASSWORD: f5_password interval: 60s labels: env: production role: load_balancer inventory_source: config/f5 - name: nri-f5 env: METRICS: \"true\" HOSTNAME: 2nd_f5_host PORT: 443 USERNAME: f5_user PASSWORD: f5_password interval: 15s labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Find and use data To find your integration data, go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services and select one of the F5 BIG-IP integration links.

Here's how to configure network flow data collection in some devices: NetFlow data Palo Alto - PAN-OS Fortinet Fortigate Cisco - NX-OS Cisco - IOS Cisco - Meraki sFlow data F5 - BIG-IP jFlow data Juniper - Junos Network security prerequisites Direction Source Destination Ports Protocol Outbound Docker host ktranslate image on Docker Hub 443 TCP Outbound Docker host New Relic Event API US Endpoint: https://insights-collector.newrelic.com EU Endpoint: https://insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net 443 TCP Outbound Docker host New Relic Log API US Endpoint: https://log-api.newrelic.com EU Endpoint: https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com 443 TCP Inbound Source devices for network flow data Docker host 9995 (default) UDP Supported types of network flow data NPM flow monitoring supports the four primary types of network flow data and their derivatives. When running the ktranslate container, you will specify which major type you want to monitor using the -nf.source option. Important The ktranslate container only supports monitoring one type of network flow data type at a time. If you want to monitor several types, each will require a container. IPFIX and NetFlow v9 can be sent to the same container, but we recommend running a separate container as a best practice. Network flow data type -nf.source value IPFIX ipfix NetFlow v5 netflow5 NetFlow v9 netflow9 sFlow sflow AppFlow netflow5 Argus netflow5 cflowd netflow5 J-Flow netflow5 NetStream netflow5 RFlow netflow5 Cisco NSEL netflow9 Scaling network flow collection When planning your strategy for collecting network flows at scale, New Relic recommends 1 CPU per 2000 flows-per-second (120,000 flows-per-minute). Deciding whether to run more small containers to distribute load or fewer large containers to consolidate management is a matter of personal preference. Set up network flow data monitoring in New Relic One Go to one.newrelic.com and click Add more data. Scroll down until you see Network performance monitoring and click Network Flows. Follow the steps in New Relic One. one.newrelic.com > Add more data > Network performance monitoring > Network Flows to set up network flow data monitoring. To get better visibility into your network device performance, set up SNMP data monitoring. Visualize your network performance data in New Relic. Manual setup If you prefer to do the setup manually, proceed with the following steps. In your local machine, from a Linux host with Docker installed, download the ktranslate image from dockerhub by running bash Copy $ docker pull kentik/ktranslate:v2 Copy the snmp-base.yaml file to the local $HOME directory of your Docker user, and discard the container by running bash Copy $ cd . $ id=$(docker create kentik/ktranslate:v2) $ docker cp $id:/etc/ktranslate/snmp-base.yaml . $ docker rm -v $id In the snmp-base.yaml file, add your network flow devices inside the devices key with the following structure: devices: flowDevice: device_name: edge-router device_ip: 10.10.1.254 flow_only: true # Optional user tags user_tags: owning_team: net_eng environment: production Copy Tip If you're already monitoring SNMP data devices that send network flow data, you don't need to add them in your snmp-base.yaml file a second time. Run ktranslate to listen for network flows by running: Tip Add your New Relic license key and your account ID in the $NR_LICENSE_KEY and $NR_ACCOUNT_ID variables respectively. bash Copy $ docker run -d --name ktranslate-sflow --restart unless-stopped --net=host \\ > -v `pwd`/snmp-base.yaml:/snmp-base.yaml \\ > -e NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=$NR_LICENSE_KEY \\ > kentik/ktranslate:v2 \\ > -snmp /snmp-base.yaml \\ > -nr_account_id=$NR_ACCOUNT_ID \\ > -metrics=jchf \\ > -log_level=info \\ > -tee_logs=true \\ > -flow_only=true \\ > -nf.source=sflow \\ > nr1.flow $ ## If your account is located in Europe, you need to add the following option before the nr1.flow line $ ## -nr_region=EU \\ Tip This command assumes collection of sflow data. If you are collecting other flow types, you should change the suffix in the --name flag for the container and update the -nf.source argument as necessary To get better visibility into your network device performance, set up SNMP data monitoring.

Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click the Guided install button. If your account reports data through our EU datacenter, click EU Guided install. Guided install EU Guided install Our infrastructure agent discovers the applications and infrastructure and log sources running in your environment, and recommends which ones should be instrumented. The install automates the configuration and deployment of each system you choose to instrument. Why it matters With our guided install, you can instrument your applications and infrastructure and start seeing your data in New Relic in minutes. The guided install uses our command line interface (CLI), the infrastructure agent for your host environment, and a library of installation recipes to instrument your applications and infrastructure for you. That means less toil for you. Because our instrumentation recipes are open source, you can modify existing recipes, or build new ones, to suit your needs. Some technical detail The New Relic guided install uses open source installation recipes to instrument on-host integrations. These recipes include installation and setup commands, information about logs, and metadata related to what’s being installed. They're collected in a YAML file for each type of system and have all of the installation details necessary to install the infrastructure agent for a specific integration. Important On Windows, our guided install only supports Microsoft SQL Server, logs, and the infrastructure agent. All other integrations are only supported on Linux. On-host integration (OHI) recipes The guided install automates the discovery, configuration, and installation of OHIs. However, there may be times when you want to instrument them one-by-one using the CLI install command. To install any individual on-host integration, run this command: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=API_KEY NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=ACCOUNT_ID /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n INTEGRATION-FLAG Copy For example: curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli/master/scripts/install.sh | bash && sudo NEW_RELIC_API_KEY=<API_KEY> NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=<ACCOUNT_ID> /usr/local/bin/newrelic install -n apache-open-source-integration Copy The table lists the integrations supported by the guided install CLI command. The specific on-host integration commands are provided for your reference. Our open source integrations send performance metrics and inventory data from your servers and applications to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts.

MySQL: Incorrect user permissions To monitor MySQL health data, you need a valid username and password with specific permissions. These commands will create a user and grant the required permissions: Create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_SELECTED_PASSWORD';\" Copy Give replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Give select privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Once done, your next guided install attempt should work. NGINX: No status URL To monitor your NGINX server, you'll need to configure a valid status URL. status_url: The URL set up to provide the metrics using the status module. If the default value of 127.0.0.1 is incorrect, substitute the address/FQDN/URL for your system.

      "body": "After you import OpenTelemetry data into New Relic, you can use a variety of tools to analyze it. Take a look at these UI options: Explorer Data explorer and query builder Explorer: Get the big picture along with the details The New Relic Explorer tab is a good place to start gathering information about your services. It offers you a way to filter services and then filter the data to show a variety of views into your data. Find your service (entity) To get started in Explorer, you need to find your service: Go to one.newrelic.com. In the left sidebar, click Services - OpenTelemetry: In the center pane, click the service you want to know more about, or find your service by entering the name in the top filter bar. Narrow down your data with filters Once you have your entity, you can then filter for data from your service. With the filter bar Narrow data to..., you can highlight a specific facet of the telemetry recorded for your service. For example, you may want to see the error rate for a particular version of the service that you've deployed in a canary instance, so you add a filter for service.version='1.2.3'. Filters are preserved when navigating between different views of your data for a service. For example, the filter for service.version='1.2.3' carries over to the Transactions view, so that you would see telemetry on requests to the endpoints (transactions) that are running version 1.2.3 of your service, and not any other versions. Filters are preserved when navigating between the Summary, Transactions, Databases, Externals, Errors, and JVMs views. Filters are also preserved when navigating to the Distributed tracing view, but with limitations. Only filter conditions that use the equals operator (\"=\") are currently supported when navigating to Distributed tracing. If you navigate back from the Distributed tracing page, the filters you selected on the previous view will come back. Once you filter your data, the UI has various views in the left-navigation pane. See our descriptions below for view details. Summary page After you click on a service in the Explorer tab, you see the Summary page listing various golden signals about your entity. Golden signals are key monitoring details such as response time, throughput, and error rate. By using this information, you can quickly decide if you need to dig deeper. For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following: UI area Attribute Response time span.kind = server or consumer Throughput span.kind = server or consumer Error rate span.kind = server or consumer otel.status_code = ERROR Service instances pane service.instance.id (usually set via the OTel resource API) Distributed tracing In Distributed tracing, you can locate traces and examine span details. For your trace data to appear in the New Relic UI, it needs to conform to the OpenTelemetry trace semantic conventions. Also, in the Traces section of our best practices guide, you can find some tips about making sure your traces and spans appear in New Relic. The following attributes are typically not added explicitly to spans. Rather, they are usually set when creating a span or performing operations (for example, recording an error) on a span using the OpenTelemetry SDK. Attribute Description name A span’s name is generally set when starting a span. The name can generally be anything, but the OpenTelemetry specification provides guidance for certain types of spans like Database spans or HTTP spans. span.kind A span’s kind is generally set when starting a span. New Relic uses span.kind to infer that a span is an entry point to a given service. When span.kind = server or consumer it is considered an entry point. When span.kind = client or producer, it is considered a call to an external service or database system. otel.status_code A span’s status is set using the span API. The otel.status_code attribute is how it is manifested by New Relic. The UI primarily uses otel.status_code for the purpose of identifying errors. Find traces and their associated spans Here are some ways to target your searches: To find the traces you want, you can run queries like these in the filter bar: service.name = YOUR_SERVICE_NAME trace.id = YOUR_TRACE_ID When you find an interesting trace, click on it to display a waterfall diagram showing the spans of the trace. Click on specific spans within the trace to display span details in the right panel. Tip For more ways to filter traces, see our distributed tracing UI page. View spans with errors After you click on a span in the trace waterfall view, you can see span errors in the right panel under Error details. The error details are populated by spans containing otel.status_code = ERROR and display the content of otel.status_description. To narrow your search for spans with errors, you can enter otel.status_code = ERROR directly in the distributed tracing filter bar. View span events If you send span events as described by the OpenTelemetry specification, you can view them in the New Relic UI. Span events have two general types: Exceptions Non-exceptions (for example, logs) If you have span events, links for these appear in the right pane: Click on a span in the waterfall view. In the right pane, click View span events, or you can expand Error details and click the link at the bottom of the errors. When you're in span events and only want to view exceptions, slide the toggle Only show exceptions. Tip OpenTelemetry exceptions handled by the app/service are displayed independently of span error status and are not necessarily associated with a span error status. Databases The Databases page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and shows operations, throughput, and response time as charts. For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following: UI area Attribute Top database calls span.kind = client or producer db.system Facets by span name Top databases (by query time) span.kind = client or producer db.system Facets by db.system Top databases (by throughput) span.kind = client or producer db.system Facets by db.system Errors On the Errors page, you can see total errors as well as charts showing error count and error rate. For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following: span.kind = server or consumer otel.status_code = ERROR Facets by span name Externals Externals capture calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and other network entities. For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following: span.kind = client or producer db.system is not present JVMs When you drill into a specific JVM, the UI display charts driven by JVM metric data: JVM metrics follow the general semantic conventions for runtime environment metrics. The Java specific runtime metrics are not well documented. The implementation is effectively the documentation and may be subject to change. For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following: Requires a unique service.instance.id attribute for rendering the list of JVMs Service.instance.id is an OpenTelemetry resource attribute Logs The Logs page displays logs from your application. For more information about how to associate log data to your application in New Relic, see our OpenTelemetry and logging documentation. For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following: service.name To correlate with trace data, the logs should contain the trace.id and span.id attributes. Metrics explorer For selected OpenTelemetry languages, you can see information about your metrics in this section. Also, if you are using the Prometheus exporter with OpenTelemetry, you can view your metric data here. Transactions Use Transactions to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in your application's response time. To get a list of transactions: From the Transaction Summary page, select the transactions table. For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following: UI area Description Top Transactions span.kind = server or consumer Facets by span name Throughput span.kind = server or consumer Facets by span name Data explorer and query builder Explore your metrics and traces using the data explorer, or write your own queries in query builder using NRQL. For more on how to query your data once it's in New Relic, see Query your data and Introduction to NRQL.",

It's free, forever. If you're just getting acquainted with OpenTelemetry, this is what we'll explore here: Benefits of OpenTelemetry Should I use OpenTelemetry or New Relic agents? How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic Benefits of OpenTelemetry OpenTelemetry provides a secure, vendor-neutral specification for service instrumentation so that you can export data to distinct backends of your choice, such as New Relic. OpenTelemetry offers a single set of APIs and libraries that standardize how you collect and transfer telemetry data for your services. The following components make up the OpenTelemetry project: Specifications for the core pillars of observability to drive consistency across all projects. New Relic supports all of these signals: traces, metrics, and logs (see details below) APIs that contain interfaces and implementations based on the specifications SDKs (reference implementations of the APIs) created specifically for languages like Java, Python, Go, Erlang, and more Collectors that offer a vendor-agnostic implementation for processing and exporting Exporters that enable you to send data to a backend of your choice The components of OpenTelemetry work together to create some distinct advantages for capturing telemetry data: Feature Description Ubiquitous instrumentation A single, open standard of instrumentation provides better coverage and flexibility as engineers from all over the world contribute to the instrumentation. Future proof As the instrumentation gets built into libraries and frameworks, and as more vendors move to support this open standard, you can be confident that you won’t need to change your instrumentation. Support for newer technologies When new technologies emerge, contributors can build integrations into OpenTelemetry or add instrumentation directly to source code, ensuring end users can easily monitor these new technologies. Simplified choice You don’t need to decide which instrumentation option to use (a proprietary option or one of the other open standards). Cross-platform compatibility OpenTelemetry supports a variety of languages and backends. It represents a vendor-neutral path for capturing and transmitting telemetry to backends without altering existing instrumentation. Streamlined observability It is easier for vendors to support and test against a single standard as they don’t need to develop their own agents or collectors. High dimensionality OpenTelemetry uses dimensional metrics, so you can filter and facet on more aspects of the data, such as AWS regions, Kubernetes clusters, or service versions. Dimensional metrics also lead to less time between occurrence and reporting. Efficiency OpenTelemetry’s fire-and-forget trace-centric approach to instrumentation often has lower overhead than New Relic agents, especially for asynchronous workloads. It will also result in better handling of trace data for asynchronous requests. Should I use OpenTelemetry instrumentation or New Relic agents? As you consider OpenTelemetry, you may also be looking at New Relic APM agents that also capture telemetry data. As you'd expect, there is a lot of overlap between features available from OpenTelemetry agents and SDKs versus those available from New Relic APM agents. This is especially true if you're interested in distributed tracing telemetry data. The choice you make depends on what you need. We recommend that you explore both New Relic and OpenTelemetry instrumentation or discuss this with us in our CNCF Slack channel to decide what works best for you. OpenTelemetry: A work in progress OpenTelemetry is still an emerging standard, so your choices may be affected by what's available. You can check on the current state of the specification at the OpenTelemetry site. The current state of language-specific OpenTelemetry APIs and SDKs varies: some languages are still pre-alpha and may be missing instructions on how to instrument your service. Most languages have some implementation of traces that is sufficient to start exporting data to New Relic. Check out this table in GitHub that provides an overview of the state of OpenTelemetry specification compliance for each language. For languages that New Relic does not currently provide an agent or SDK, OpenTelemetry may offer you a good alternative. Also, in cases where you want explicit control over sampling of your telemetry data, OpenTelemetry provides a lot of flexibility. As OpenTelemetry matures, New Relic will continue to support new OpenTelemetry data models and to provide a curated UI experience for our Full Stack Observability customers. New Relic's APM agents In general, New Relic's APM agents will collect more telemetry data for your services, and they offer a wide range of configuration options and an extensive set of auto-instrumentation capabilities. New Relic's APM agents offer detailed transaction trace visibility for individual services. They also offer predefined sampling to balance the performance impact of your instrumentation against the need to capture enough data to gain helpful insights. How OpenTelemetry works with New Relic New Relic supports the native OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) for exporting telemetry data. This allows you to use the vendor neutral components developed by the OpenTelemetry community to export your data to New Relic. The following tables show the supported features for each telemetry signal. If you have questions about these or have an unsupported use case, please contact us in our CNCF Slack channel, and watch this page for future updates. Important New Relic's exporters for OpenTelemetry are now deprecated in favor of exporting data to New Relic using OTLP. Traces New Relic offers support for the OTLP ingest of trace signals. The maturity of the upstream specification is stable. OpenTelemetry traces and spans are compatible with New Relic traces and spans. OpenTelemetry spans optionally include attributes (name-value pairs) and resource attributes which map directly to dimensions that can be used to facet or filter span data at query time. OpenTelemetry span metadata (for example, name, kind, and trace_id) also map directly to dimensions on NewRelic spans. At this time, New Relic does not support span links or array attributes. For details, see the Traces section of our best practices guide. Feature Supported Span events ✅ Span linking ❌ Array of primitives (homogeneous) ❌ Metrics New Relic offers support for the OTLP ingest of metric signals. Note that the maturity of the upstream specification is experimental. We intend to follow potentially breaking upstream changes. Here are the OpenTelemetry data types we support and their associated mappings. For details, see the Metrics section of our best practices guide. Metric Type Supported Delta sums ✅ Cumulative sums ✅ Gauges ✅ Delta histograms ✅ Summary ✅ Cumulative histograms ❌ Exemplars ❌ Array of primitives (homogeneous) ❌ Logs New Relic offers support for the OTLP ingest of log signals. Note that the maturity of the upstream specification is experimental. We intend to follow potentially breaking upstream changes. OpenTelemetry logs are compatible with New Relic logs. OpenTelemetry logs optionally include attributes (name-value pairs) and resource attributes which map directly to dimensions that can be used to facet or filter log data at query time. OpenTelemetry log metadata (for example, name, severity_text, and trace_id) also map directly to dimensions on New Relic logs. NewRelic currently supports all OpenTelemetry log message types except for arrays. For more details, see the Logs section of our best practices guide. Feature Supported Description LogRecord body ✅ Supported types: string, boolean, int, double, bytes LogRecord attributes ✅ Supported types: string, boolean, int, double, bytes LogRecord fields ✅ Examples: name, severity_text, trace_id Array messages ❌ Array attributes ❌ Next steps Follow the OpenTelemetry quick start to help you get started. You'll also want to review the best practices guide for getting the most out of the data you export to New Relic.",

      "body": "Tip Want to help make this doc better? Try our beta MySQL monitoring integration doc and give us feedback by creating a GitHub issue. Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. Quick start Instrument your MySQL database quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the MySQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MySQL database. Install and activate To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-mysql. Change the directory to the integration's folder. cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file mysql-config.yml as explained in the next section. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host where PostgreSQL is installed or on a host capable of remotely accessing where PostgreSQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered.

Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol.

Labels and custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels. These aren't mandatory, and you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: jmx Copy Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integrations: - name: nri-jmx env: COLLECTION_FILES: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" JMX_HOST: jmx-host.localnet JMX_PASS: admin JMX_PORT: 9999 JMX_USER: admin interval: 15s labels: env: production Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern.

Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Tip Want to help make this doc better? Try our beta MySQL monitoring integration doc and give us feedback by creating a GitHub issue. Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. Quick start Instrument your MySQL database quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the MySQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MySQL database. Install and activate To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-mysql. Change the directory to the integration's folder. cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file mysql-config.yml as explained in the next section. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host where PostgreSQL is installed or on a host capable of remotely accessing where PostgreSQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL SSL configuration collection file integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' ENABLE_SSL: true TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE: false SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/root_cert.crt SSL_CERT_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/postgresql.crt SSL_KEY_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/postgresql.key TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL custom query integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: ALL CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY: >- select 'rows_inserted' as \"metric_name\", 'delta' as \"metric_type\", sd.tup_inserted as \"metric_value\", sd.datid as \"database_id\" from pg_stat_database sd; TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL custom query config file An additional YAML configuration file with one or more custom SQL can be defined and the integration will need the path to the file in the CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG parameter. postgresql-config.yml integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: ALL CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG: \"path/to/postgresql-custom-query.yml\" TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy postgresql-custom-query.yml --- queries: # Metric names are set to the column names in the query results - query: >- SELECT BG.checkpoints_timed AS scheduled_checkpoints_performed, BG.checkpoints_req AS requested_checkpoints_performed, BG.buffers_checkpoint AS buffers_written_during_checkpoint, BG.buffers_clean AS buffers_written_by_background_writer, BG.maxwritten_clean AS background_writer_stops, BG.buffers_backend AS buffers_written_by_backend, BG.buffers_alloc AS buffers_allocated FROM pg_stat_bgwriter BG; # database defaults to the auth database in the main config database: new_frontier_config_dev # If not set explicitly here, metric type will default to # 'gauge' for numbers and 'attribute' for strings metric_types: buffers_allocated: rate # If unset, sample_name defaults to PostgresqlCustomSample sample_name: MyCustomSample Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, or inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our configuration format document. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, refer to the standard configuration doc for help. Specific settings related to JMX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your JMX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. JMX Instance Settings The JMX integration collects both metrics (M) and inventory (I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection. For an example, see the host connection file example. Setting Description Default Applies To JMX_HOST The host JMX is running on. localhost M/I JMX_PORT The port JMX is running on. 9999 M/I JMX_URI_PATH The path portion of the JMX Service URI. This is useful for nonstandard service uris. N/A M/I JMX_USER The username for the JMX connection. N/A M/I JMX_PASS The password for the JMX connection. N/A M/I JMX_REMOTE (JBoss specific) Whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format. Connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. false M/I JMX_REMOTE_JBOSS_STANDLONE (JBoss specific) Whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format. Only relevant if jmx_remote is set. false M/I CONNECTION_URL Full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" N/A M/I COLLECTION_FILES A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. N/A M/I KEY_STORE The filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. N/A M/I KEY_STORE_PASSWORD The password for the SSL key store. N/A M/I LOCAL_ENTITY Collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. false M/I TIMEOUT The timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. 10000 M/I TRUST_STORE The filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. N/A M/I TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD The password for the trust store. N/A M/I METRIC_LIMIT Number of metrics that can be collected per entity. If this limit is exceeded the entity will not be reported. A limit of 0 implies no limit. 200 M/I METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0 or higher. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information (such as passwords) from being exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels. These aren't mandatory, and you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: jmx Copy Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integrations: - name: nri-jmx env: COLLECTION_FILES: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" JMX_HOST: jmx-host.localnet JMX_PASS: admin JMX_PORT: 9999 JMX_USER: admin interval: 15s labels: env: production Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern. Useful if using a wildcard query exclude_regex: # This will match any bean where the name is YoungGen - name=YoungGen attributes: - attr: LastGcInfo.GcThreadCount metric_type: gauge metric_name: GCThreadCount # Domains can be wildcarded - domain: java.util.* # If the domain is wildcarded, a custom event must be defined event_type: JavaUtilSample beans: # If no attributes are defined, all are collected by default - query: type=Logging Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration. Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. Quick start Instrument your MySQL database quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the MySQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MySQL database. Install and activate To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-mysql. Change the directory to the integration's folder. cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file mysql-config.yml as explained in the next section. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard.

      "body": "The New Relic PostgreSQL on-host integration receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. If you don't have one already, create a New Relic account. It's free, forever. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with PostgreSQL 9.0 or higher. If PostgreSQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host where PostgreSQL is installed or on a host capable of remotely accessing where PostgreSQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Quick start Instrument your PostgreSQL instance quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the PostgreSQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your PostgreSQL instance. Install and activate To install the PostgreSQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the procedures to install the infrastructure integration package using the file name nri-postgresql. Change directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy of the sample configuration file: sudo cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Before you restart the infrastructure agent, create a user with READ permissions on the required functions. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-postgresql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-postgresql/nri-postgresql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-postgresql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp postgresql-config.yml.sample postgresql-config.yml Copy Edit the postgresql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. PostgreSQL users and permissions Create a user with SELECT permissions on: pg_stat_database pg_stat_database_conflicts pg_stat_bgwriter You can complete this step before or after you configure the postgresql-config.yml file. To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration: CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD 'PASSWORD'; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic; GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic; Copy This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance. If you also want to obtain table and index-related metrics (for example, table size and index size), the PostgreSQL role used by the integration (new_relic) also needs SELECT permissions on the tables from which it will gather metrics from. For example, to allow the integration to collect metrics from all the tables and indexes present in the database (in the public schema), use the following: GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO new_relic; Copy Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, postgresql-config.yml. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. Specific settings related to PostgreSQL are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your PostgreSQL instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. PostgreSQL Instance Settings The PostgreSQL integration collects both Metrics(M) and Inventory(I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME The hostname for the PostgreSQL connection. localhost M/I PORT The port where PostgreSQL is running. 5432 M/I USERNAME The user name for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I PASSWORD The password for the PostgreSQL connection. Required. N/A M/I COLLECTION_LIST JSON array, a JSON object, or the string literal ALL that specifies the entities to be collected. The PostgreSQL user can only collect table and index metrics from tables it has SELECT permissions for. Required except for PgBouncer. Examples. N/A M COLLECTION_IGNORE_DATABASE_LIST JSON array of database names that will be ignored for metrics collection. Typically useful for cases where COLLECTION_LIST is set to ALL and some databases need to be ignored. '[]' M PGBOUNCER Collect pgbouncer metrics. false M ENABLE_SSL Determines if SSL is enabled. If true, ssl_cert_location and ssl_key_location are required. false M/I TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE If true, the server certificate is not verified for SSL. If false, the server certificate identified in ssl_root_cert_location is verified. false M/I SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded root certificate file. Required if trust_server_certificate is false. N/A M/I SSL_CERT_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client certificate file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I SSL_KEY_LOCATION Absolute path to PEM-encoded client key file. Required if enable_ssl is true. N/A M/I TIMEOUT maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Set to 0 for no timeout. 10 M/I DATABASE The PostgreSQL database to connect to. postgres M/I CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY A SQL query that required columns metric_name, metric_type, and metric_value.metric_type can be gauge, rate, delta, or attribute. Additional columns collected with the query are added to the metric set as attributes. N/A M CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG A path to a YAML file with a list of custom queries, along with their metric type, database, and sample name overrides. See example for details. N/A M COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS Enable collecting database lock metrics, which can be performance intensive. false M COLLECT_BLOAT_METRICS Enable tablespace bloat metrics, which can be performance intensive. true M METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0+. Read more here. Using Secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information such as passwords to be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see Secrets management. Labels/Custom Attributes Environment variables can be used to control config settings, such as your license key, and are then passed through to the Infrastructure agent. For instructions on how to use this feature, see Configure the Infrastructure agent. You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pairs attributes to your metrics which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels but, as they are not mandatory, you can remove, modify or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: postgresql Copy Example configuration Example postgresql-config.yml file configuration: PostgreSQL configuration collection file JSON array: Interpreted as a list of database names from which to collect all relevant metrics, including any tables and indexes belonging to that database. For example: collection_list: '[\"postgres\"]' JSON object: only entities specified in the object will be collected, no automatic discovery will be performed. The levels of JSON are database name -> schema name -> table name -> index name. For example: collection_list: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' ALL: collect metrics for all databases, schemas, tables, and indexes discovered. For example: collection_list: 'ALL' integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: '{\"postgres\":{\"public\":{\"pg_table1\":[\"pg_index1\",\"pg_index2\"],\"pg_table2\":[]}}}' TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL SSL configuration collection file integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: '[\"postgres\"]' ENABLE_SSL: true TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE: false SSL_ROOT_CERT_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/root_cert.crt SSL_CERT_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/postgresql.crt SSL_KEY_LOCATION: /etc/newrelic-infra/postgresql.key TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL custom query integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: ALL CUSTOM_METRICS_QUERY: >- select 'rows_inserted' as \"metric_name\", 'delta' as \"metric_type\", sd.tup_inserted as \"metric_value\", sd.datid as \"database_id\" from pg_stat_database sd; TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy PostgreSQL custom query config file An additional YAML configuration file with one or more custom SQL can be defined and the integration will need the path to the file in the CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG parameter. postgresql-config.yml integrations: - name: nri-postgresql env: USERNAME: postgres PASSWORD: pass HOSTNAME: psql-sample.localnet PORT: 6432 DATABASE: postgres COLLECT_DB_LOCK_METRICS: false COLLECTION_LIST: ALL CUSTOM_METRICS_CONFIG: \"path/to/postgresql-custom-query.yml\" TIMEOUT: 10 interval: 15s labels: env: production role: postgresql inventory_source: config/postgresql Copy postgresql-custom-query.yml --- queries: # Metric names are set to the column names in the query results - query: >- SELECT BG.checkpoints_timed AS scheduled_checkpoints_performed, BG.checkpoints_req AS requested_checkpoints_performed, BG.buffers_checkpoint AS buffers_written_during_checkpoint, BG.buffers_clean AS buffers_written_by_background_writer, BG.maxwritten_clean AS background_writer_stops, BG.buffers_backend AS buffers_written_by_backend, BG.buffers_alloc AS buffers_allocated FROM pg_stat_bgwriter BG; # database defaults to the auth database in the main config database: new_frontier_config_dev # If not set explicitly here, metric type will default to # 'gauge' for numbers and 'attribute' for strings metric_types: buffers_allocated: rate # If unset, sample_name defaults to PostgresqlCustomSample sample_name: MyCustomSample Copy For more about the general structure of on-host integration configuration, see Configuration.

Inventory data The PostgreSQL integration collects each setting from pg_settings along with its boot_val and reset_val. The inventory data appears on the Inventory page, under the config/postgresql source. Troubleshooting Here are some troubleshooting tips for the PostgreSQL integration: If you have connection problems, make sure you can connect to the cluster from the same box with psql. If you have problems collecting PgBouncer metrics, make sure you are connected to the instance through PgBouncer. Default port is 6432. If you get the error message Error creating list of entities to collect: pq: unsupported startup parameter: extra_float_digits, set ignore_startup_parameters = extra_float_digits in the PgBouncer config file. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file that automatically collects key metrics from the JVM. You can also customize your metric collection with YAML files to collect any subset of metrics. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with Java 8 or higher. If you need to use a different Java version than the one configured in PATH, follow New Relic's configuration documentation on GitHub. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If JMX is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you must install the infrastructure agent on a host that's running JMX. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. This integration does not support the IIOP protocol. Install and activate To install the JMX integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-jmx. Change the directory to the integrations folder: cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Copy the JVM configuration file: sudo cp jvm-metrics.yml.sample jvm-metrics.yml Copy Optional: If you're interested in monitoring Tomcat, use this sample metrics file: sudo cp tomcat-metrics.yml.sample tomcat-metrics.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Important If the sample files are not present in your installation, you can download them directly from the GitHub repository. Windows Download the nri-jmx .MSI installer image from: http://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-jmx/nri-jmx-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-jmx-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp jmx-config.yml.sample jmx-config.yml Copy Edit the jmx-config.yml configuration file using the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. When the Infrastructure agent executes the nri-jmx binary, it sets the path to PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin. The java binary must be in one of those paths. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configure the integration An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, jmx-config.yml. The JMX integration defines and collects integration data using two types of YAML files: the integration configuration options and the metrics collection options. Configuration options are below. For examples, see Example config. Integration configuration files The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations, such as interval, timeout, or inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our configuration format document. Important If you're still using our legacy configuration/definition files, refer to the standard configuration doc for help. Specific settings related to JMX are defined using the env section of the configuration file. These settings control the connection to your JMX instance as well as other security settings and features. The list of valid settings is described in the next section of this document. Config options are below. For an example configuration, see the example config file. JMX Instance Settings The JMX integration collects both metrics (M) and inventory (I) information. Check the Applies To column below to find which settings can be used for each specific collection. For an example, see the host connection file example. Setting Description Default Applies To JMX_HOST The host JMX is running on. localhost M/I JMX_PORT The port JMX is running on. 9999 M/I JMX_URI_PATH The path portion of the JMX Service URI. This is useful for nonstandard service uris. N/A M/I JMX_USER The username for the JMX connection. N/A M/I JMX_PASS The password for the JMX connection. N/A M/I JMX_REMOTE (JBoss specific) Whether or not to use the JMX remote URL connection format. Connection defaults to JBoss Domain-mode if true. false M/I JMX_REMOTE_JBOSS_STANDLONE (JBoss specific) Whether or not to use the JBoss standalone connection format. Only relevant if jmx_remote is set. false M/I CONNECTION_URL Full JMX endpoint URL. This replaces all connection arguments (above) by providing all parameters on one line. Example: \"service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:7199/jmxrmi\" N/A M/I COLLECTION_FILES A comma-separated list of full file paths to the metric collection definition files. For on-host install, the default JVM metrics collection file is at /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml. N/A M/I KEY_STORE The filepath of the keystore containing the JMX client's SSL certificate. N/A M/I KEY_STORE_PASSWORD The password for the SSL key store. N/A M/I LOCAL_ENTITY Collect all metrics on the local entity. Only use when monitoring localhost. false M/I TIMEOUT The timeout for individual JMX queries, in milliseconds. 10000 M/I TRUST_STORE The filepath of the keystore containing the JMX server's SSL certificate. N/A M/I TRUST_STORE_PASSWORD The password for the trust store. N/A M/I METRIC_LIMIT Number of metrics that can be collected per entity. If this limit is exceeded the entity will not be reported. A limit of 0 implies no limit. 200 M/I METRICS Set to true to enable Metrics only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable Inventory only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way. Replacing the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent v1.14.0 or higher. Read more here or see the example below. Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensible information (such as passwords) from being exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can further decorate your metrics using labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics, which you can then use to query, filter or group your metrics on. Our default sample config file includes examples of labels. These aren't mandatory, and you can remove, modify, or add new ones of your choice. labels: env: production role: jmx Copy Metrics collection files The metrics collection definition files are structured YAML files which tell the integration what metrics to collect. For an example configuration, see the metrics collection file example. Default JVM metrics collection file: /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml Tip You can write different collection files to ease organization and maintenance. See configuration file for an example. Domains The integration collects and organizes metrics according to domains. All metrics defined per domain will be sent to New Relic and can be found in a corresponding event type. This event type is either auto-generated or can be set by the user. Each file contains a single collect: block which contains an array of domains. For each domain, the following keys are defined: domain: The JMX domain; for example, java.lang. You can use wildcards to match multiple domains; for example, java.*. If you use a wildcard, event_type is required, and must be unique. This field is required. event_type: The event type name for a collection from this domain. If the domain is wildcarded, this is required, and must be unique. If the domain is not wildcarded and this is undefined by the user, this will be auto generated. For example, the domain java.lang will have event type JavaLangSample. For more information, see Naming tips. beans: An array of beans to collect in this domain. Important There is a limit of 200 metrics per instance in the configuration file. If you exceed the limit for a particular instance, it will not be sent to New Relic. If you're not seeing your data in New Relic, review the troubleshooting procedures to identify if you have exceeded the limit. Beans Each domain contains an array of beans to be collected. For each bean, the following keys are defined: query: The bean name to collect; for example,type=GarbageCollector,name=YoungGen. You can use wildcards; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=*. This field is required. exclude_regex: An optional list of regex patterns that match beans to exclude from collection; for example, type=GarbageCollector,name=.*. attributes: A list of attributes to collect. If unspecified, collects all attributes. Important The HashMap and ArrayList data types are not supported. Attributes Each bean can contain attributes, an optional list of beans that can be excluded from collection. For each attribute, the following keys are defined: Important For map attributes, you must define either an attr or an attr_regex key. attr: An exact match of the attribute name. Composite attributes can be collected by appending the composite member name to the attribute name with a dot; for example, HeapMemoryUsage.Max. attr_regex: A regex pattern that matches the attributes to be collected. metric_type: The New Relic metric type to collect this attribute as. Options are: gauge: data will be collected as an instantaneous numeric measurement. rate: data will be collected as the change in that metric per second. delta: data will be collected as the change in that metric since the last measurement. attribute: data will be collected as a string literal. If left unspecified, the JMX integration will attempt to infer the metric type based on the value returned. For example, if the metric is a number, it will collect it as gauge. If the metric is a string, it will collect it as attribute. If metrics are collected with an incorrect metric type, you can manually specify the correct metric type in the collection file. metric_name: The name under which the metric will appear in New Relic. If unspecified, it will default to the attribute name. For more information about JMX queries, see the Oracle ObjectName documentation. Optional: Custom connector JMX allows the use of custom connectors to communicate with the application. In order to use a custom connector, you have to include the custom connectors in the nrjmx classpath. By default, the sub-folder connectors is in the classpath. If this folder does not exist, create it under the folder where nrjmx is installed. For example, to add support for JBoss, create a folder named connectors under the default (Linux) library path /usr/lib/nrjmx/ (/usr/lib/nrjmx/connectors/) and copy the custom connector jar ($JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-cli-client.jar) into it. You can now execute JMX queries against JBoss. Example configurations Example file configurations for an on-host install: Example host connection file integrations: - name: nri-jmx env: COLLECTION_FILES: \"/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/jvm-metrics.yml,/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/tomcat-metrics.yml\" JMX_HOST: jmx-host.localnet JMX_PASS: admin JMX_PORT: 9999 JMX_USER: admin interval: 15s labels: env: production Copy Example metrics collection file collect: # The event type for this domain will be JavaLangSample - domain: java.lang beans: # Collect all beans of type Threading - query: type=Threading # Attributes can be either a string or a map attribute: # When unspecified, the metric_type is inferred # and the metric name is just the attribute name - ThreadCount # If using a map attribute, a custom metric name can be set - attr: TotalStartedThreadCount metric_name: ThreadsStarted # Attributes can be collected with regex matches and # the metric type can be overridden if the integration # can not correctly infer the type - attr_regex: \"ThreadCpu.*Enabled\" metric_type: attribute - query: type=Memory attributes: # Composite attributes can be collected with this syntax - HeapMemoryUsage.Max - NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max # Queries can be wildcarded where - query: type=GarbageCollector,name=* # If a specific bean is unwanted, it can be excluded # with a regex match pattern.

Tips for naming your data Metrics are sent and stored in the form of samples. This is a list of key-value pairs that include metric data and metadata. Each sample is stored as an event in New Relic’s event database. You are responsible for creating and naming the JMX data reported to New Relic. For this reason, New Relic strongly recommends following these conventions when naming your event types. To ensure you have a consistent naming scheme: Use camel case. Use a name that clearly identifies what data it contains. Example: MyorgApplicationSample Recommendation: Use the same naming scheme for similar metrics across different applications. Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. JMX data is attached to the user-defined event type specified in the configuration file. For example, if you are interested in monitoring Tomcat using the JMX integration, define an event_type called TomcatSample, and query that event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The metrics generated by the integration include metadata associated with the MBean they are collecting from. You can use this metadata in NRQL queries to filter and facet the data so that the query returns only the data for the desired beans. It can also be used to uniquely identify the metrics, since the metric name is not necessarily unique between all beans. Each event contains the following metadata: Name Description displayName The JMX domain name for these metrics. entityName The JMX domain name for these metrics with the entity type “domain:” prepended. host The JMX host the metrics are being collected from. query The query used to collect these metrics. bean The bean whose attributes these metrics were collected from. key:<mbean_key> For each key in the bean name, an attribute is added to the metric set called “key:<mbean_key> with the value of the bean’s key. Example NRQL query Here's an example NRQL query taking advantage of metadata monitor all the collected JVM garbage collectors: SELECT latest(CollectionTime) FROM JVMSample FACET `key:name` WHERE `key:type` = 'GarbageCollector' Copy Metrics data attributes The JMX integration collects the following metric data attributes: Name Description HeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java heap memory used. HeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java heap memory committed to be used. HeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java heap memory allocated. HeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java heap memory available. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Used The total Java non-heap memory used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Committed The total Java non-heap memory committed to be used. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Init The initial Java non-heap memory allocated. NonHeapMemoryUsage.Max The maximum Java non-heap memory available. ThreadCount The number of live threads. CollectionCount The total number of garbage collections that have occurred. CollectionTime The approximate accumulated garbage collection time elapsed. Inventory data The JMX integration captures the configuration parameters of the JMX integration. The data is available on the Inventory page, under the config/jmx source. For more about inventory data, see Understand integration data. Troubleshooting Troubleshooting tips: Search logs for errors If you are having trouble with the integration, first enable and search the logs for errors. Metrics limit exceeded If you suspect there is a domain sending more than 200 metrics, check the log file for this message: \"Domain x has n metrics, the current limit is 200. This domain will not be reported.\" Copy If you see this error message, lower the number of metrics being sent for the reported domain. Missing metrics If you have missing metrics, ensure that the MBean query is valid by attempting to run it with the nrjmx tool, or use your preferred tool for ensuring the query is valid in the JMXConsole. Dashboard not appearing in Infrastructure monitoring Confirm that the configuration jvm-metrics.yml file has been updated, and that the path to the file is enumerated in the jmx-config.yml file. Troubleshooting via jmxterm JMXTerm is a CLI interactive tool bundled within the package. Docs for JMXTerm can be found at our nrjmx page in GitHub. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it.",

      "body": "From a New Relic perspective, entity is a broad concept. An entity is anything New Relic can identify that has data you can monitor. Integrations can be configured to create their own entity, called a remote entity, by setting the remote_monitoring option to true. If set to false, an integration will be considered a local entity, and the data related to it will be attached to the host entity that the agent creates. Remote monitoring requires infrastructure agent version 1.2.25 or higher. For the Apache, Cassandra, MySQL, NGINX, and Redis integrations, remote monitoring (and multi-tenancy) is enabled by activating the configuration parameter remote_monitoring. Important If your Apache, Cassandra, MySQL, NGINX, or Redis service is located in the same host as the agent, when you activate remote monitoring the resulting entity will be considered as remote, regardless of its actual location. This may affect alerts, alter attributes, and have other effects, as explained here. Effects of activating remote_monitoring By enabling remote_monitoring, the integration becomes a different entity which is no longer attached to the infrastructure agent. As a result, the following items may be affected: Alert verification Enabling remote monitoring can affect your configured alerts in case they are using any of the values that are affected by this new feature. We strongly recommend checking your existing alerts to make sure they keep on working as expected. New entity attributes These attributes are modified in the resulting entity: Display name: New entity unique key (instead of using the display name) Entity GUID: New entity GUID Entity ID: New entity ID Entity key: New entity unique key (instead of using the display name) External key: Using integration entity name (instead of using the agent display) Changes in recorded metrics When remote monitoring is enabled, we will add the hostname and port values to all metrics. If the nricluster name or nriservice are defined in the integration configuration file, they will also be decorated. Unrecorded attributes Since the integration is now an independent entity which is not attached to the agent, the following agent attributes are not collected: agentName agentVersion coreCount criticalViolationCount fullHostname instanceType kernelVersion linuxDistribution entityType operatingSystem processorCount systemMemoryBytes warningViolationCount Your custom attributes Updated hostname For the ApacheSample, RedisSample, CassandraSample, and NginxSample integration metrics, we will use the integration configuration hostname instead of the short hostname from the agent.

To see what the predefined alert conditions are, see Kubernetes integration: Predefined alert policy. In addition, you can create an alert condition for any metric collected by any New Relic integration you use, including the Kubernetes integration: Select the alert type Integrations. From the Select a data source dropdown, select a Kubernetes (K8s) data source. Select alert notifications When an alert condition's threshold is triggered, New Relic sends a message to the notification channel(s) chosen in the alert policy. Depending on the type of notification, you may have the following options: View the incident. Acknowledge the incident. Go to a chart of the incident data by selecting the identifier name. The entity identifier that triggered the alert appears near the top of the notification message. The format of the identifier depends on the alert type: Available pods are less than desired pods alerts: K8s:CLUSTER_NAME:PARENT_NAMESPACE:replicaset:REPLICASET_NAME Copy CPU or memory usage alerts: K8s:CLUSTER_NAME:PARENT_NAMESPACE:POD_NAME:container:CONTAINER_NAME Copy Here are some examples. Pod alert notification example For Available pods are less than desired pods alerts, the ID of the ReplicaSet triggering the issue might look like this: k8s:beam-production:default:replicaset:nginx-deployment-1623441481 Copy This identifier contains the following information: Cluster name: beam-production Parent namespace: default ReplicaSet name: nginx-deployment-1623441481 Container resource notification example For container CPU or memory usage alerts, the entity might look like this: k8s:beam-production:kube-system:kube-state-metrics-797bb87c75-zncwn:container:kube-state-metrics Copy This identifier contains the following information: Cluster name: beam-production Parent namespace: kube-system Pod namespace: kube-state-metrics-797bb87c75-zncwn Container name: kube-state-metrics Create alert conditions using NRQL Follow standard procedures to create alert conditions for NRQL queries.

      "body": "Tip Want to help make this doc better? Try our beta MySQL monitoring integration doc and give us feedback by creating a GitHub issue. Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. Quick start Instrument your MySQL database quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the MySQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MySQL database. Install and activate To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-mysql. Change the directory to the integration's folder. cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file mysql-config.yml as explained in the next section. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional.

      "body": "Read on to learn how New Relic on-host integrations collect and report data to New Relic. Data collection and reporting process This is how an infrastructure on-host integration sends data to New Relic: On startup, the infrastructure agent scans the directory that contains the integration's definition files. The infrastructure agent registers every integration executable defined in the definition file. The agent scans a dedicated directory for integration configuration files. If those config files specify integrations that have been registered with the infrastructure agent, the agent sets up and schedules the integrations. At the scheduled interval (the default is 15 seconds), the agent harvests the data from the integration and prepares it for transmission. Every 60 seconds, it sends that data to New Relic, along with any other infrastructure data. After a successful collection pass, the integration executable exits. File structure and specifications Understanding the file structure of New Relic on-host integrations can help you customize your integration, understand and use your data, and troubleshoot problems. On-host integrations adhere to a set of open source specifications, allowing anyone to build their own infrastructure on-host integration.

Our integration collects Kubernetes data by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. For a simpler and more visual experience, use the cluster explorer. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can query your Kubernetes data and create clear visualizations. Query Kubernetes data The simplest way to query your Kubernetes data is using the query builder, which accepts NRQL queries. Alternatively, you can use the NerdGraph API to retrieve Kubernetes data.

To filter the alert to Kubernetes entities that only have the chosen attributes, select Filter. Select the threshold settings. For more on the Trigger an alert when... options, see Alert types. Select an existing alert policy, or create a new one. Select Create. When an alert condition's threshold is triggered, New Relic sends a notification to the policy's notification channels. Use the predefined alert types and thresholds The Kubernetes integration comes with its own alert policy and alert conditions. To see what the predefined alert conditions are, see Kubernetes integration: Predefined alert policy. In addition, you can create an alert condition for any metric collected by any New Relic integration you use, including the Kubernetes integration: Select the alert type Integrations. From the Select a data source dropdown, select a Kubernetes (K8s) data source. Select alert notifications When an alert condition's threshold is triggered, New Relic sends a message to the notification channel(s) chosen in the alert policy. Depending on the type of notification, you may have the following options: View the incident. Acknowledge the incident. Go to a chart of the incident data by selecting the identifier name. The entity identifier that triggered the alert appears near the top of the notification message. The format of the identifier depends on the alert type: Available pods are less than desired pods alerts: K8s:CLUSTER_NAME:PARENT_NAMESPACE:replicaset:REPLICASET_NAME Copy CPU or memory usage alerts: K8s:CLUSTER_NAME:PARENT_NAMESPACE:POD_NAME:container:CONTAINER_NAME Copy Here are some examples. Pod alert notification example For Available pods are less than desired pods alerts, the ID of the ReplicaSet triggering the issue might look like this: k8s:beam-production:default:replicaset:nginx-deployment-1623441481 Copy This identifier contains the following information: Cluster name: beam-production Parent namespace: default ReplicaSet name: nginx-deployment-1623441481 Container resource notification example For container CPU or memory usage alerts, the entity might look like this: k8s:beam-production:kube-system:kube-state-metrics-797bb87c75-zncwn:container:kube-state-metrics Copy This identifier contains the following information: Cluster name: beam-production Parent namespace: kube-system Pod namespace: kube-state-metrics-797bb87c75-zncwn Container name: kube-state-metrics Create alert conditions using NRQL Follow standard procedures to create alert conditions for NRQL queries.

      "body": "Tip Want to help make this doc better? Try our beta MySQL monitoring integration doc and give us feedback by creating a GitHub issue. Help us continue creating great experiences for you! Our MySQL integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your MySQL database to our platform, where you can see the health of your database server and analyze metric data so that you can easily find the source of any problems. Read on to install the integration, and to see what data we collect. Compatibility and requirements Our integration is compatible with MySQL version 5.6 or higher. Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet the following requirements: A New Relic account. Don't have one? Sign up for free! No credit card required. If MySQL is not running on Kubernetes or Amazon ECS, you can install the infrastructure agent on a Linux or Windows OS host or on a host capable of remotely accessing where MySQL is installed. Otherwise: If running on Kubernetes, see these requirements. If running on ECS, see these requirements. Important For MySQL v8.0 and higher we do not support the following metrics: cluster.slaveRunning, db.qCacheFreeMemoryBytes, db.qCacheHitRatio, db.qCacheNotCachedPerSecond. Quick start Instrument your MySQL database quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install creates a customized CLI command for your environment that downloads and installs the New Relic CLI and the infrastructure agent. Ready to get started? Click one of these button to try it out. Guided install EU Guided install Our guided install uses the infrastructure agent to set up the MySQL integration. Not only that, it discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, you can find other methods below to get started monitoring your MySQL database. Install and activate To install the MySQL integration, follow the instructions for your environment: ECS See Monitor service running on ECS. Kubernetes See Monitor service running on Kubernetes. Linux Follow the instructions for installing an integration, using the file name nri-mysql. Change the directory to the integration's folder. cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d Copy Copy the sample configuration file: sudo cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the configuration file mysql-config.yml as explained in the next section. Restart the infrastructure agent. Windows Download the nri-mysql .MSI installer image from: https://download.newrelic.com/infrastructure_agent/windows/integrations/nri-mysql/nri-mysql-amd64.msi To install from the Windows command prompt, run: msiexec.exe /qn /i PATH\\TO\\nri-mysql-amd64.msi Copy In the Integrations directory, C:\\Program Files\\New Relic\\newrelic-infra\\integrations.d\\, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running: cp mysql-config.yml.sample mysql-config.yml Copy Edit the mysql-config.yml file as described in the configuration settings. Restart the infrastructure agent. Additional notes: Advanced: Integrations are also available in tarball format to allow for install outside of a package manager. On-host integrations do not automatically update. For best results, regularly update the integration package and the infrastructure agent. Configuration Enabling your MySQL Server To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with replication and select permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics: From the command line, create a user newrelic@localhost with a specific password. sudo mysql -e \"CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YOUR_PASSWORD' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant replication privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Grant privileges to newrelic@localhost with a maximum of 5 connections. sudo mysql -e \"GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;\" Copy Configure the integration There are several ways to configure the integration, depending on how it was installed: If enabled via Kubernetes: see Monitor services running on Kubernetes. If enabled via Amazon ECS: see Monitor services running on ECS. If installed on-host: edit the config in the integration's YAML config file, nginx-config.yml. An integration's YAML-format configuration is where you can place required login credentials and configure how data is collected. Which options you change depend on your setup and preference. The configuration file has common settings applicable to all integrations like interval, timeout, inventory_source. To read all about these common settings refer to our Configuration Format document. Important If you are still using our Legacy configuration/definition files please refer to this document for help. The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: MySQL Instance Settings The MySQL integration collects both Metrics and Inventory information. In the table, use the Applies To column for the settings available to each collection: Setting Description Default Applies To HOSTNAME Hostname or IP where MySQL is running. localhost Metrics/Inventory PORT Port on which MySQL server is listening. 3306 Metrics/Inventory USERNAME Username for accessing the MySQL server. N/A Metrics/Inventory PASSWORD Password for the given user. N/A Metrics/Inventory SOCKET Path to Unix socket file on which MySQL server is listening. Use this instead of Hostname/Port. N/A Metrics/Inventory DATABASE Name of the database to be monitored. If omitted all databases will be monitored. N/A Metrics/Inventory USE_TLS Use TLS when communicating with the MySQL server. false Metrics/Inventory INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY Disable server name verification when connecting over TLS. false Metrics/Inventory OLD_PASSWORDS Use old password hashing method. false Metrics/Inventory EXTRA_CONNECTION_URL_ARGS Specify extra connection parameters as attr1=val1&attr2=val2. N/A Metrics/Inventory EXTENDED_METRICS Captures an extended set of metrics. This also enables the capture of slave metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS Captures additional innodb metrics. false Metrics EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS Captures additional MyISAM metrics. false Metrics REMOTE_MONITORING Enable multi-tenancy monitoring. true Metrics/Inventory METRICS Set to true to enable metrics-only collection. false INVENTORY Set to true to enable inventory-only collection. false The values for these settings can be defined in several ways: Add the value directly to the configuration file. This is the most common way. Replace the values from environment variables using the {{}} notation. This requires infrastructure agent 1.14.0+. For more on this, see more on infrastructure agent passthrough environment variables. Use secrets management to protect sensible information, such as passwords, so that it's not exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see secrets management. Labels and custom attributes You can also decorate your metrics with labels. Labels allow you to add key/value pair attributes to your metrics so that you can query, filter, or group your metrics. Even though our default sample configuration file includes examples of labels, they're optional. You can remove, modify, or add new ones. labels: env: production role: load_balancer Copy Example configurations Basic configuration This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Basic configuration with different metric/inventory intervals This configuration collects metrics every 30 seconds and inventory every 60 seconds: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: INVENTORY: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 60s labels: environment: production inventory_source: config/mysql Copy Metrics-only with TLS connection Use to connect to MySQL with TLS. You can add TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY : true to disable the server name verification: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password USE_TLS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only connecting over socket Use to connect to MySQL using a socket file. This is an alternative to a TCP Hostname/Port connection: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password SOCKET: /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Metrics-only with all extended metrics Use this to collect your metrics including extended, slave, innodb and my-isam metrics: integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: localhost PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql_user PASSWORD: mysql_password EXTENDED_METRICS: true EXTENDED_INNODB_METRICS: true EXTENDED_MY_ISAM_METRICS: true REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Multi-instance monitoring Use this if you need to collect metrics from two different MySQL servers using the the same integration. integrations: - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host1 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql1_user PASSWORD: mysql1_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production - name: nri-mysql env: METRICS: true HOSTNAME: mysql_host2 PORT: 3306 USERNAME: mysql2_user PASSWORD: mysql2_password REMOTE_MONITORING: true interval: 30s labels: environment: production Copy Find and use data Data from this service is reported to an integration dashboard. Metrics are attached to the MysqlSample event type. You can query this data for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards. For more on how to find and use your data, see Understand integration data. Metric data The MySQL integration collects the following metrics: Default metrics These metrics are captured by default: Name Description cluster.slaveRunning Boolean. 1 if this server is a replication slave that is connected to a replication master, and both the I/O and SQL threads are running; otherwise, it is 0.

      "body": "Our cloud integrations get data from cloud provider APIs. In New Relic, you can change some of the data collection-related settings for your cloud integrations. Read on to see what changes you can make and the reasons for making them. Overview of settings New Relic cloud integrations get data from cloud providers' APIs. Data is generally collected from monitoring APIs such as AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and GCP Stackdriver, and inventory metadata is collected from the specific services' APIs. You can use the account status dashboard to see how your cloud integrations are handling data from a cloud service provider. If you want to report more or less data from your cloud integrations, or if you need to control the use of the cloud providers' APIs to prevent reaching rate and throttling limits in your cloud account, you can change the configuration settings to modify the amount of data they report. The two main controls are: Change polling frequency Change what data is reported Examples of business reasons for wanting to change your polling frequency include: Billing: If you need to manage your AWS CloudWatch bill, you may want to decrease the polling frequency. Before you do this, make sure that any alert conditions set for your cloud integrations are not affected by this reduction. New services: If you are deploying a new service or configuration and you want to collect data more often, you may want to increase the polling frequency temporarily. Caution Changing the configuration settings for your integrations may impact alert conditions and chart trends. Change polling frequency The polling frequency configuration determines how often New Relic reports data from your cloud provider for each service. By default, the polling frequency is set to the maximum frequency that is available for each service. To change the polling frequency for a cloud integration: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure. Select the tab that corresponds to your cloud service provider. Select Configure next to the integration. Use the dropdowns next to Data polling interval every to select how frequently you want New Relic to capture your cloud integration data. Specify data to be fetched You can specify which information you want captured for your cloud integration by enabling the collection of additional data and by applying multiple filters to each integration. To change this settings for your cloud integration: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure. Select the tab that corresponds to your cloud service provider. Select Configure next to the integration. Under Data collections and filters, turn the toggles you want On. For filters, select or enter the values that you want included in your reported data. Data collection For some cloud integrations, an additional number of calls to the cloud provider APIs are needed in order to collect data. For example, to fetch tags for AWS Elastic Map Reduce clusters, an additional call to the service API is required. To better control the amount of API calls that are sent to your cloud account for these integrations, you can specify when you need these types of data to be collected. Different data collection toggles are available, depending on the integration. Toggle Description Collect tags Some integrations require additional API calls to the cloud provider to report tags. Tag collection is enabled by default. Switch this to Off if you don't want the integration to collect your cloud resource tags and thus reduce the volume of API calls. Collect extended inventory Some integrations can collect extended inventory metadata about your cloud resources by making additional API calls to the cloud provider. The metadata included within the extended inventory for each cloud integration is described in the integration documentation. Extended inventory collection is disabled by default. Switch this to On if you want to monitor extended inventory. This will increase the volume of API calls. Collect shards data Available for AWS Kinesis Streams integration. By default, we don't report shard metrics. Switch this to On if you want to monitor shard metrics in addition to data stream metrics. Collect Lambda@Edge data Available for AWS CloudFront integration. By default, we don't report Lambda@Edge data. Switch this to On if you're using Lambda@Edge in AWS CloudFront and want to get Lambda execution location metadata. Collect node data Available for AWS Elasticsearch integration. By default, we don't report Elasticsearch node metrics. Switch this to On if you want to monitor node metrics in addition to cluster metrics. Collect NAT Gateway data and Collect VPN data Available for AWS VPC integration. By default, we don't report NAT Gateway nor VPN metrics. Switch these to On if you want to monitor NAT Gateway and VPN metrics and inventory, in addition to other VPC related entities inventory. Collect IP addresses Available for AWS EC2 integration. By default, we collect EC2 instance metadata that includes public and private IP addresses, and network interface details. Switch this to Off if you don't want New Relic to store and display these IP data. Filters When a filter is On, you specify the data that you want to be collected; for example, if the Limit to AWS region is On, the regions that you select will be the ones that data will be collected for. There are different filters available, depending on the integration: Filter Description Region Select the regions that include the resources that you want to monitor. Queue prefixes Available for AWS SQS integration. Enter each name or prefix for the queues that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Load balancer prefixes Available for AWS ALB integration. Enter each name or prefix for the application load balancers that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Stage name prefixes Available for AWS API Gateway integration. Enter each name or prefix for the stages that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Tag key Enter one tag key that is associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive, and you can use this filter in combination with tag value filter. Tag value Enter one tag value that is associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive, and you can use this filter in combination with tag key. Resource group Select the resource groups that are associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Potential impact on alerts and charts If you change an integration's configuration, it can impact alert conditions and charts. Here are some things to consider: If you change this setting... It may have this impact... Any configuration setting When you change the configuration settings, the data that New Relic displays in infrastructure charts, on the inventory page, and in the events feed changes as well. Any filters When you create alert conditions after you set filters, make sure that your alerts are not triggered by resources that you filtered out. Filter for regions If you filter for specific regions, it may lower the amount of data reported to New Relic, which could trigger an alert. If you create an alert condition for a specific region and then filter that region out, the region would no longer report data and would never trigger the alert. Polling frequency When you create an alert, make sure that you define the threshold for a time period that is longer than the polling frequency. Tags and extended inventory If you turn on tags and/or extended inventory, New Relic makes more API calls to the cloud provider, which could increase your cloud provider API usage bill.",

      "body": "New Relic offers various integrations for reporting data to our platform. One category of integrations is our Infrastructure integrations. Types of infrastructure integrations New Relic has two main categories of infrastructure integrations: cloud and on-host. Cloud integrations Cloud integrations collect data from cloud services and accounts. There's no installation process for cloud integrations, you simply connect your New Relic account to your cloud provider account. Integrations Description Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-based integrations Connect your Amazon Web Services (AWS) account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of AWS integrations. Microsoft Azure cloud-based integrations Connect your Microsoft Azure account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of Azure integrations. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) cloud-based integrations Connect your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of GCP integrations. On-host integrations On-host integrations are infrastructure monitoring integrations that can be run directly on your host or server: Integrations Description Kubernetes integration Connect your account to gain visibility of your Kubernetes environment, explore your clusters, and manage alerts. On-host integrations Monitor and report data from many popular services, including NGINX, MySQL, Redis, Apache, RabbitMQ, and many more. Build your own To create your own lightweight integration, use our Flex integration tool. Install instructions To enable cloud integrations or install on-host integrations, see: Cloud integrations: AWS procedures, Azure procedures, Google Cloud Platform procedures Kubernetes: Kubernetes procedures On-host integrations: See an integration's documentation for install procedures Features After an infrastructure integration is activated, you can: Filter and analyze the metrics and configuration data in our Infrastructure UI. Query your data and create custom charts and dashboards. Create alert conditions to monitor problems with your services' performance. For cloud integrations, configure data collection settings. Types of integration data Infrastructure integrations generate some basic types of data that you can use in New Relic. Integration data Description Metrics Numeric measurement data. Examples: Number of requests in a queue Number of hits on a database per minute Percentage of CPU being used Cloud-based and on-host integrations include pre-built dashboards that display important metrics. Inventory Live system state and configuration information. Examples: Host name AWS region or availability zone Port being used Changes in inventory generate events in New Relic, so you can easily figure out when performance issues were caused by a change in the system. Events Important activity on a system. Examples: Service starting Version update New table being created Changes to inventory are a type of event. Attributes Key-value pairs generated by some integrations. Examples: Certain inventory data Additional data attached to events Any data that is not considered metrics or inventory Depending on the integration, other types of information may be reported as attributes. Our integrations are data agnostic; they have no knowledge of whether reported data contains personal information.

Integrations Description Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-based integrations Connect your Amazon Web Services (AWS) account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of AWS integrations. Microsoft Azure cloud-based integrations Connect your Microsoft Azure account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of Azure integrations. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) cloud-based integrations Connect your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of GCP integrations. On-host integrations On-host integrations are infrastructure monitoring integrations that can be run directly on your host or server: Integrations Description Kubernetes integration Connect your account to gain visibility of your Kubernetes environment, explore your clusters, and manage alerts. On-host integrations Monitor and report data from many popular services, including NGINX, MySQL, Redis, Apache, RabbitMQ, and many more. Build your own To create your own lightweight integration, use our Flex integration tool. Install instructions To enable cloud integrations or install on-host integrations, see: Cloud integrations: AWS procedures, Azure procedures, Google Cloud Platform procedures Kubernetes: Kubernetes procedures On-host integrations: See an integration's documentation for install procedures Features After an infrastructure integration is activated, you can: Filter and analyze the metrics and configuration data in our Infrastructure UI. Query your data and create custom charts and dashboards. Create alert conditions to monitor problems with your services' performance. For cloud integrations, configure data collection settings. Types of integration data Infrastructure integrations generate some basic types of data that you can use in New Relic. Integration data Description Metrics Numeric measurement data. Examples: Number of requests in a queue Number of hits on a database per minute Percentage of CPU being used Cloud-based and on-host integrations include pre-built dashboards that display important metrics. Inventory Live system state and configuration information. Examples: Host name AWS region or availability zone Port being used Changes in inventory generate events in New Relic, so you can easily figure out when performance issues were caused by a change in the system. Events Important activity on a system. Examples: Service starting Version update New table being created Changes to inventory are a type of event. Attributes Key-value pairs generated by some integrations. Examples: Certain inventory data Additional data attached to events Any data that is not considered metrics or inventory Depending on the integration, other types of information may be reported as attributes. Our integrations are data agnostic; they have no knowledge of whether reported data contains personal information.

      "body": "Our cloud integrations get data from cloud provider APIs. In New Relic, you can change some of the data collection-related settings for your cloud integrations. Read on to see what changes you can make and the reasons for making them. Overview of settings New Relic cloud integrations get data from cloud providers' APIs. Data is generally collected from monitoring APIs such as AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and GCP Stackdriver, and inventory metadata is collected from the specific services' APIs. You can use the account status dashboard to see how your cloud integrations are handling data from a cloud service provider. If you want to report more or less data from your cloud integrations, or if you need to control the use of the cloud providers' APIs to prevent reaching rate and throttling limits in your cloud account, you can change the configuration settings to modify the amount of data they report. The two main controls are: Change polling frequency Change what data is reported Examples of business reasons for wanting to change your polling frequency include: Billing: If you need to manage your AWS CloudWatch bill, you may want to decrease the polling frequency. Before you do this, make sure that any alert conditions set for your cloud integrations are not affected by this reduction. New services: If you are deploying a new service or configuration and you want to collect data more often, you may want to increase the polling frequency temporarily. Caution Changing the configuration settings for your integrations may impact alert conditions and chart trends. Change polling frequency The polling frequency configuration determines how often New Relic reports data from your cloud provider for each service. By default, the polling frequency is set to the maximum frequency that is available for each service. To change the polling frequency for a cloud integration: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure. Select the tab that corresponds to your cloud service provider. Select Configure next to the integration. Use the dropdowns next to Data polling interval every to select how frequently you want New Relic to capture your cloud integration data. Specify data to be fetched You can specify which information you want captured for your cloud integration by enabling the collection of additional data and by applying multiple filters to each integration. To change this settings for your cloud integration: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure. Select the tab that corresponds to your cloud service provider. Select Configure next to the integration. Under Data collections and filters, turn the toggles you want On. For filters, select or enter the values that you want included in your reported data. Data collection For some cloud integrations, an additional number of calls to the cloud provider APIs are needed in order to collect data. For example, to fetch tags for AWS Elastic Map Reduce clusters, an additional call to the service API is required. To better control the amount of API calls that are sent to your cloud account for these integrations, you can specify when you need these types of data to be collected. Different data collection toggles are available, depending on the integration. Toggle Description Collect tags Some integrations require additional API calls to the cloud provider to report tags. Tag collection is enabled by default. Switch this to Off if you don't want the integration to collect your cloud resource tags and thus reduce the volume of API calls. Collect extended inventory Some integrations can collect extended inventory metadata about your cloud resources by making additional API calls to the cloud provider. The metadata included within the extended inventory for each cloud integration is described in the integration documentation. Extended inventory collection is disabled by default. Switch this to On if you want to monitor extended inventory. This will increase the volume of API calls. Collect shards data Available for AWS Kinesis Streams integration. By default, we don't report shard metrics. Switch this to On if you want to monitor shard metrics in addition to data stream metrics. Collect Lambda@Edge data Available for AWS CloudFront integration. By default, we don't report Lambda@Edge data. Switch this to On if you're using Lambda@Edge in AWS CloudFront and want to get Lambda execution location metadata. Collect node data Available for AWS Elasticsearch integration. By default, we don't report Elasticsearch node metrics. Switch this to On if you want to monitor node metrics in addition to cluster metrics. Collect NAT Gateway data and Collect VPN data Available for AWS VPC integration. By default, we don't report NAT Gateway nor VPN metrics. Switch these to On if you want to monitor NAT Gateway and VPN metrics and inventory, in addition to other VPC related entities inventory. Collect IP addresses Available for AWS EC2 integration. By default, we collect EC2 instance metadata that includes public and private IP addresses, and network interface details. Switch this to Off if you don't want New Relic to store and display these IP data. Filters When a filter is On, you specify the data that you want to be collected; for example, if the Limit to AWS region is On, the regions that you select will be the ones that data will be collected for. There are different filters available, depending on the integration: Filter Description Region Select the regions that include the resources that you want to monitor. Queue prefixes Available for AWS SQS integration. Enter each name or prefix for the queues that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Load balancer prefixes Available for AWS ALB integration. Enter each name or prefix for the application load balancers that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Stage name prefixes Available for AWS API Gateway integration. Enter each name or prefix for the stages that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive. Tag key Enter one tag key that is associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive, and you can use this filter in combination with tag value filter. Tag value Enter one tag value that is associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Filter values are case-sensitive, and you can use this filter in combination with tag key. Resource group Select the resource groups that are associated with the resources that you want to monitor. Potential impact on alerts and charts If you change an integration's configuration, it can impact alert conditions and charts. Here are some things to consider: If you change this setting... It may have this impact... Any configuration setting When you change the configuration settings, the data that New Relic displays in infrastructure charts, on the inventory page, and in the events feed changes as well. Any filters When you create alert conditions after you set filters, make sure that your alerts are not triggered by resources that you filtered out. Filter for regions If you filter for specific regions, it may lower the amount of data reported to New Relic, which could trigger an alert. If you create an alert condition for a specific region and then filter that region out, the region would no longer report data and would never trigger the alert. Polling frequency When you create an alert, make sure that you define the threshold for a time period that is longer than the polling frequency. Tags and extended inventory If you turn on tags and/or extended inventory, New Relic makes more API calls to the cloud provider, which could increase your cloud provider API usage bill.",

Integrations Description Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-based integrations Connect your Amazon Web Services (AWS) account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of AWS integrations. Microsoft Azure cloud-based integrations Connect your Microsoft Azure account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of Azure integrations. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) cloud-based integrations Connect your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of GCP integrations. On-host integrations On-host integrations are infrastructure monitoring integrations that can be run directly on your host or server: Integrations Description Kubernetes integration Connect your account to gain visibility of your Kubernetes environment, explore your clusters, and manage alerts. On-host integrations Monitor and report data from many popular services, including NGINX, MySQL, Redis, Apache, RabbitMQ, and many more.

      "body": "Most data generated by integrations is available in New Relic One dashboards, where you can query your data using NRQL and build custom dashboards. The following tips and sample queries were created for New Relic-built integrations, but most will also apply to integrations built with the Integrations SDK. For a general look at how to find and use integration data, see New Relic data types. Get started with integration data Here are some tips for finding and exploring your integration data in New Relic: From the one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > Third-party services page, select an integration dashboard. There, you can view the NRQL queries that generated a chart. For examples of NRQL queries for integration data, see the example queries. Use the data explorer or the dashboards to explore and understand the available data. Read the documentation for a specific integration to learn about the reported data. When you create a useful query you'd like to add to your dashboard, select Add to dashboard. Example NRQL queries Here are some examples of NRQL queries that use integration data: AWS EBS query example Here's a NRQL query for the AWS EBS service, showing the total write time metric, faceted by entityName: SELECT sum('provider.volumeTotalWriteTime.Sum') FROM BlockDeviceSample WHERE provider = 'EbsVolume' FACET entityName Copy Azure Service Bus query example Here's a NRQL query for the maximum number of messages in an Azure Service Bus topic queue, faceted by resource group: SELECT max(activeMessages.Maximum) FROM AzureServiceBusTopicSample FACET resourceGroupName Copy Azure Functions query example Here's a NRQL query for Azure Functions, showing the count of executed functions over the past six hours by region over time: SELECT sum(functionExecutionCount.Total) FROM AzureFunctionsAppSample FACET regionName TIMESERIES SINCE 6 hours ago Copy Azure VMs query example Here's a NRQL query for Azure VMs that compares the count of VM events over the past thirty minutes with the same time a week ago: SELECT uniqueCount(vMName) FROM AzureVirtualMachineScaleSetSample FACET name SINCE 30 minutes ago COMPARE WITH 1 week ago Copy NGINX query example Here's an example of a query that you might run on your NGINX integration data and place in a dashboard. This query creates a chart showing the average value of NGINX requests per second over time: SELECT average(net.requestsPerSecond) FROM NginxSample TIMESERIES Copy For more on how to create queries, see NRQL syntax. MySQL query example Here's an example of a query that you might run on your MySQL integration data. This query generates a chart showing the maximum number of used MySQL connections: SELECT max(net.maxUsedConnections) FROM MysqlSample Copy For more on how to create queries, see NRQL syntax. Inventory change query example Here's an example of a query that groups inventory change events from the last day by the type of change: SELECT count(*) FROM InfrastructureEvent WHERE format='inventoryChange' FACET changeType SINCE 1 DAY AGO Copy Tip You can also perform these queries using dimensional metrics. Tips for using different data types Integrations can generate metric, event, and inventory data, all of which are available for querying. Here are some tips for using the different types of integration data: Metric data tips Tips for finding and using integration metric data: All integration data is attached to a data type known as an event (not to be confused with events reported by integrations, which represent important activity in your host/service). This means that all integration data can be found via the data explorer. For more about these two basic New Relic data types, see New Relic data collection. Metric values are treated as attributes: key-value pairs attached to an event. For example, the MySQL integration has an 'active connections' metric; this would be found by querying the connectionsActive attribute of the MysqlSample event. For general information about metrics, see Integration metric data. Event data tips Here are some tips for finding and using integration event data when querying: Most integration events are inventory change events. When inventory is changed, it generates an InfrastructureEvent with a format value of inventoryChange. Integration data can be found via the data explorer. For general information about events, see Event data. Inventory data tips Here are some tips for finding and using integration inventory data: For general information about inventory data, see Integration inventory data. Some inventory data is added as attributes (key-value pairs) to this data. For example, the AWS EC2 integration collects awsRegion as inventory data; this would be found by querying the awsRegion attribute of the ComputeSample event type and provider Ec2Instance. When inventory data changes, an InfrastructureEvent event type is generated with a format value of inventoryChange. See the query examples for an example of querying this data. For more on using NRQL queries, see Intro to NRQL.",

Connect AWS to New Relic Important AWS CloudWatch metric streams is now the recommended solution to monitor AWS services. Learn more in New Relic's CloudWatch solution and AWS CloudWatch blog posts. Follow the steps documented in the AWS CloudWatch metric stream integration to ingest all available CloudWatch metrics. To connect additional API Polling integrations: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS. Click on one of the available service tiles. From the IAM console, click Create role, then click Another AWS account. For Account ID, use 754728514883. Check the Require external ID box. For External ID, enter your New Relic account ID. Do not enable the setting to Require MFA (multi-factor authentication). Attach the Policy: Search for ReadOnlyAccess, select the checkbox for the policy named ReadOnlyAccess, then click Next: Review. Alternatively, you can create your own managed policy and limit the permissions you grant New Relic according to the AWS services you want to monitor. For the Role name, enter NewRelicInfrastructure-Integrations, then click Create role. Select the newly created role from the listed roles. On the Role summary page, select and copy the entire Role ARN (required later in this procedure). Configure a Budgets policy: While viewing the Role summary for your new role, select Add inline policy. Create a Custom policy: Enter a policy name (for example, NewRelicBudget), add the following permission statement, and then select Apply policy. { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"budgets:ViewBudget\" ], \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy Return to the New Relic UI to enter your AWS account name and the ARN for the new role. Select the Amazon Web Services to be monitored with New Relic infrastructure integrations, then Save. Connect multiple AWS integrations To connect multiple AWS integrations to a single New Relic account: If you previously set up an ARN with the more restrictive AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess policy, first unlink your existing integration, then create a new one with a broader policy. Follow the instructions to connect your Amazon account to New Relic . Provide the ARN that contains the ReadOnlyAccess policy. Once setup is complete, select the integrations you want to monitor: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS. Select the edit icon. Select the checkbox for each integration you want to monitor. Connect multiple AWS accounts By default, the Amazon EC2 AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess permission grants New Relic access to all EC2 instances in the individual Amazon account you specify during the setup steps. If you have multiple AWS accounts, follow the steps to connect an AWS account for each AWS account you want to associate with New Relic. Add or edit custom tags New Relic automatically imports custom tags you have added or edited for your AWS resources. Most metrics received via CloudWatch metric streams will have custom tags as dimensions. For API Polling integrations, if you don't see any tags in the Add filter menu of the Filter sets sidebar within a few minutes, delete the integration and try again: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS. Select the edit icon. Remove individual integrations or the entire account linkage as needed. Note that not all integrations support tags collection. You can enable (and disable) tags collection in the integration settings. Disconnect your AWS integrations You can disable one or more integrations anytime and still keep your AWS account connected to New Relic. However, New Relic recommends that you do not disable EC2 or EBS monitoring. These two integrations add important metadata to your EC2 instances and EBS volumes in New Relic. To uninstall your services completely from New Relic infrastructure Integrations, unlink your AWS account. Regional support China regions are not supported.",

Types of infrastructure integrations New Relic has two main categories of infrastructure integrations: cloud and on-host. Cloud integrations Cloud integrations collect data from cloud services and accounts. There's no installation process for cloud integrations, you simply connect your New Relic account to your cloud provider account. Integrations Description Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-based integrations Connect your Amazon Web Services (AWS) account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of AWS integrations. Microsoft Azure cloud-based integrations Connect your Microsoft Azure account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of Azure integrations. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) cloud-based integrations Connect your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of GCP integrations. On-host integrations On-host integrations are infrastructure monitoring integrations that can be run directly on your host or server: Integrations Description Kubernetes integration Connect your account to gain visibility of your Kubernetes environment, explore your clusters, and manage alerts. On-host integrations Monitor and report data from many popular services, including NGINX, MySQL, Redis, Apache, RabbitMQ, and many more. Build your own To create your own lightweight integration, use our Flex integration tool. Install instructions To enable cloud integrations or install on-host integrations, see: Cloud integrations: AWS procedures, Azure procedures, Google Cloud Platform procedures Kubernetes: Kubernetes procedures On-host integrations: See an integration's documentation for install procedures Features After an infrastructure integration is activated, you can: Filter and analyze the metrics and configuration data in our Infrastructure UI. Query your data and create custom charts and dashboards. Create alert conditions to monitor problems with your services' performance. For cloud integrations, configure data collection settings. Types of integration data Infrastructure integrations generate some basic types of data that you can use in New Relic. Integration data Description Metrics Numeric measurement data. Examples: Number of requests in a queue Number of hits on a database per minute Percentage of CPU being used Cloud-based and on-host integrations include pre-built dashboards that display important metrics. Inventory Live system state and configuration information. Examples: Host name AWS region or availability zone Port being used Changes in inventory generate events in New Relic, so you can easily figure out when performance issues were caused by a change in the system. Events Important activity on a system. Examples: Service starting Version update New table being created Changes to inventory are a type of event. Attributes Key-value pairs generated by some integrations. Examples: Certain inventory data Additional data attached to events Any data that is not considered metrics or inventory Depending on the integration, other types of information may be reported as attributes. Our integrations are data agnostic; they have no knowledge of whether reported data contains personal information.

Connect AWS to New Relic Important AWS CloudWatch metric streams is now the recommended solution to monitor AWS services. Learn more in New Relic's CloudWatch solution and AWS CloudWatch blog posts. Follow the steps documented in the AWS CloudWatch metric stream integration to ingest all available CloudWatch metrics. To connect additional API Polling integrations: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS. Click on one of the available service tiles. From the IAM console, click Create role, then click Another AWS account. For Account ID, use 754728514883. Check the Require external ID box. For External ID, enter your New Relic account ID. Do not enable the setting to Require MFA (multi-factor authentication). Attach the Policy: Search for ReadOnlyAccess, select the checkbox for the policy named ReadOnlyAccess, then click Next: Review. Alternatively, you can create your own managed policy and limit the permissions you grant New Relic according to the AWS services you want to monitor. For the Role name, enter NewRelicInfrastructure-Integrations, then click Create role. Select the newly created role from the listed roles. On the Role summary page, select and copy the entire Role ARN (required later in this procedure). Configure a Budgets policy: While viewing the Role summary for your new role, select Add inline policy. Create a Custom policy: Enter a policy name (for example, NewRelicBudget), add the following permission statement, and then select Apply policy. { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"budgets:ViewBudget\" ], \"Resource\": \"*\" } ] } Copy Return to the New Relic UI to enter your AWS account name and the ARN for the new role. Select the Amazon Web Services to be monitored with New Relic infrastructure integrations, then Save. Connect multiple AWS integrations To connect multiple AWS integrations to a single New Relic account: If you previously set up an ARN with the more restrictive AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess policy, first unlink your existing integration, then create a new one with a broader policy. Follow the instructions to connect your Amazon account to New Relic . Provide the ARN that contains the ReadOnlyAccess policy. Once setup is complete, select the integrations you want to monitor: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS. Select the edit icon. Select the checkbox for each integration you want to monitor. Connect multiple AWS accounts By default, the Amazon EC2 AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess permission grants New Relic access to all EC2 instances in the individual Amazon account you specify during the setup steps. If you have multiple AWS accounts, follow the steps to connect an AWS account for each AWS account you want to associate with New Relic. Add or edit custom tags New Relic automatically imports custom tags you have added or edited for your AWS resources. Most metrics received via CloudWatch metric streams will have custom tags as dimensions. For API Polling integrations, if you don't see any tags in the Add filter menu of the Filter sets sidebar within a few minutes, delete the integration and try again: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure > AWS. Select the edit icon. Remove individual integrations or the entire account linkage as needed. Note that not all integrations support tags collection. You can enable (and disable) tags collection in the integration settings. Disconnect your AWS integrations You can disable one or more integrations anytime and still keep your AWS account connected to New Relic. However, New Relic recommends that you do not disable EC2 or EBS monitoring. These two integrations add important metadata to your EC2 instances and EBS volumes in New Relic. To uninstall your services completely from New Relic infrastructure Integrations, unlink your AWS account. Regional support China regions are not supported.",

Integrations Description Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-based integrations Connect your Amazon Web Services (AWS) account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of AWS integrations. Microsoft Azure cloud-based integrations Connect your Microsoft Azure account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of Azure integrations. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) cloud-based integrations Connect your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account to monitor and report data to New Relic. See the list of GCP integrations. On-host integrations On-host integrations are infrastructure monitoring integrations that can be run directly on your host or server: Integrations Description Kubernetes integration Connect your account to gain visibility of your Kubernetes environment, explore your clusters, and manage alerts. On-host integrations Monitor and report data from many popular services, including NGINX, MySQL, Redis, Apache, RabbitMQ, and many more.

Query your data and create custom charts and dashboards. Create alert conditions to monitor problems with your services' performance. For cloud integrations, configure data collection settings. Types of integration data Infrastructure integrations generate some basic types of data that you can use in New Relic. Integration data Description Metrics Numeric measurement data. Examples: Number of requests in a queue Number of hits on a database per minute Percentage of CPU being used Cloud-based and on-host integrations include pre-built dashboards that display important metrics. Inventory Live system state and configuration information. Examples: Host name AWS region or availability zone Port being used Changes in inventory generate events in New Relic, so you can easily figure out when performance issues were caused by a change in the system. Events Important activity on a system. Examples: Service starting Version update New table being created Changes to inventory are a type of event. Attributes Key-value pairs generated by some integrations. Examples: Certain inventory data Additional data attached to events Any data that is not considered metrics or inventory Depending on the integration, other types of information may be reported as attributes. Our integrations are data agnostic; they have no knowledge of whether reported data contains personal information.

Get started Our Kubernetes integration comes bundled with some of our on-host integrations (like Cassandra, MySQL, and Apache). This lets you get data for those supported services by adding a section to the Kubernetes integration's configuration, which lives as a ConfigMap inside a manifest. What you need Enable this feature for a service Details about how configuration works For an example of how to monitor Redis running on a Kubernetes PHP Guestbook, see this tutorial. What you need To monitor services running on Kubernetes, you only need a Kubernetes cluster running the Kubernetes integration, version 1.16.0 or higher (install | check version | update).

You should see data being reported. Additional notes about enabling services: Enabling multiple services may use more resources than what is set in the resource limits of the Kubernetes integration config file. If this becomes an issue, raise the limit in the resources section. The Kubernetes integration does not automatically update. For best results, regularly update. Monitor services in our Kubernetes integration installed with Helm If you installed our Kubernetes integration using Helm, to monitor services you need to update the existing installation with the new configuration, which contains the services to monitor: helm upgrade --reuse-values -f values.yaml [RELEASE] [CHART] Copy If you use nri-bundle charts, you need to update the children's chart values. Find some examples here. Learn more More resources for learning about configuration: Learn technical details about how configuration works. Learn how to configure monitoring of multiple services with the same config file. See a step-by-step tutorial showing how to monitor a Redis service on Kubernetes. Manually configure service monitoring The enable procedure should be all you need to get monitoring working, but if you run into problems, understanding some technical details about configuration can be helpful. This section goes into more detail about how configuration works. For each service you wish to monitor, you must add a configuration file for that integration to our Kubernetes integration's configuration. This document will cover these subjects: How the service-specific configuration YAML snippet works Adding the service-specific YAML in the Kubernetes integration's config file Adding multiple services to the Kubernetes integration's config file How the service-specific YAML config works Our Kubernetes integration's configuration follows the ConfigMap format. Using a ConfigMap allows us to decouple the configuration for the integrations from the Kubernetes image. The other benefit is that a ConfigMap can be updated automatically without reloading the running container. Because the infrastructure agent uses YAML to configure its associated integrations, ConfigMaps are a good choice for storing YAML. (For more information on config file format, see the Integration config file format.) The Kubernetes integration image comes with an auto-discovery feature that simplifies the configuration of multiple instances of services using a single configuration file. For example, if you have several NGINX instances running, creating an NGINX integration configuration file for every instance would be hard to implement and hard to update. With our auto-discovery option, you can discover and monitor all your NGINX instances with a single configuration file. Each integration has its own specific configuration YAML. Our NGINX integration default config file looks like this: nginx-config.yml: | --- discovery: command: # Use the following optional arguments : # --namespaces: Comma separated list of namespaces to discover pods on # --port: Port used to connect to the kubelet. Default is 10255 # --tls: Use secure (TLS) connection # Custom Example: # exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes --namespaces namespace1,namespace2 --port 10250 --tls # Default exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes match: label.app: nginx integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://${discovery.ip}/status STATUS_MODULE: discover METRICS: 1 Copy The above config enables the following: Runs nri-discovery-kubernetes to query the data for the node we are currently on. Parses the data that comes back and looks for any Kubernetes pod that has a Kubernetes container with an app= label with value nginx. For any matches, it attempts to run the NGINX integration. The status URL is built from: The pod's IP address The status page is pulled from the label on K8s pod called status_url This automatic discovery works the same as the container auto-discovery used by the infrastructure agent. For more advanced options, see Container auto-discovery. Add a service YAML to the Kubernetes integration config It's best practice to configure enabled integrations alongside the Kubernetes integration configuration. This is easier than maintaining configuration files for every single service/integration instance. Below is an example of a Kubernetes integration's ConfigMap. The highlighted section shows where an integration configuration YAML (in this case, NGINX) is placed. For more information on discovery:, see Container auto-discovery for on-host integrations. --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: nginx-config.yml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=nginx\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Use the following optional arguments : # --namespaces: Comma separated list of namespaces to discover pods on # --tls: Use secure (TLS) connection # --port: Port used to connect to the kubelet.

Make sure the namespace used is the same one used by the Kubernetes integration manifest. If you haven't changed it in the downloaded manifest file, the value is default. Add multiple services to the same config You can monitor several services using the same Kubernetes integration config file. To do this, add another integration configuration YAML to the same Kubernetes integration config file. Below is the Kubernetes config created in the last section, with a new section for the Cassandra integration's config (highlighted). --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: nginx-config.yml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=nginx\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Run discovery for Kubernetes.

      "body": "Helm is a package manager on top of Kubernetes. It facilitates installation, upgrades, or revision tracking, and it manages dependencies for the services that you install in Kubernetes. To install the integration using Helm, we recommend our Kubernetes automated installer, which will prompt for almost all configuration options and autopopulate secrets and values for you. Additionally, our automated installer also allows to install our integration as plain manifests rather than a Helm release. See Kubernetes integration: install and configure for more details about how to use our automated installer. Start the installer This page describes in more depth how to install and configure the New Relic integration without using the automated installer. Compatibility and requirements Make sure Helm is installed on your machine. We strongly recommend using Helm 3 to manage the Kubernetes integration. Our charts are also compatible with Helm 2, but support for it might be removed in the future. To install the Kubernetes integration using Helm, you will need your New Relic account license key and your Kubernetes cluster's name: Find and copy your New Relic license key. Find the name of your cluster with this command: kubectl config current-context Copy Note this values somewhere safe as you will need them later during the installation process. Install Kubernetes integration with Helm Install with Helm 3 and nri-bundle (recommended) New Relic has several charts for the different components which offer different features for the platform: newrelic-infrastructure: Contains the main Kubernetes integration and the infrastructure agent. This is the core component for the New Relic Kubernetes experience, responsible of reporting most of the data that is surfaced in dashboard and the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer. newrelic-logging: Provides a DaemonSet with New Relic's Fluent Bit output plugin to easily forward your logs to New Relic. nri-kube-events: Collects and reports cluster events (such as kubectl get events) to New Relic. nri-prometheus: New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics Integration, automatically scrapes Prometheus endpoints present in the cluser and reports metrics to New Relic. nri-metadata-injection: Sets up a minimal MutatingAdmissionWebhook that injects a couple of environment to containers. These contain metadata about the cluster and New Relic installation and will be later picked up by applications instrumented using APM, allowing to correlate APM and infrastructure data. nri-statsd: New Relic StatsD integration. Additionally, New Relic provides nri-bundle, a chart which pulls a selectable set of the charts mentioned above. nri-bundle can also install Kube State Metrics and Pixie for you if needed. While it is possible to install those charts separately, we strongly recommend using the nri-bundle chart for Kubernetes deployments, as it ensures that values across all the charts are consistent and provides full control over which components are installed, as well as the possibility to configure all of them as Helm dependencies. This is the same chart that is used and referenced by our automated installer. Installing and configuring nri-bundle with Helm Ensure you are using the appropriate context in the machine where you will run Helm and kubectl: You can check the available contexts with: kubectl config get-contexts Copy And switch to the desired context using: kubectl config use-context CONTEXT_NAME Copy Add the New Relic Helm charts repo: helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. Notice that we are specifying --dry-run and --debug, so nothing will be installed in this step: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set ksm.enabled= true \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged= true \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy Please notice and adjust the following flags: global.licenseKey=<var>YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY</var>: Must be set to a valid License Key for your account. global.cluster=<var>K8S_CLUSTER_NAME</var>: Is used to identify the cluster in the New Relic UI, so should be a descriptive value not used by any other Kubernetes cluster configured in your New Relic account. ksm.enabled=<mark>true</mark>: Setting this to true will automatically install Kube State Metrics (KSM) for you, which is required for our integration to run. You can set this to false if KSM is already present in your cluster, even if it is on a different namespace. newrelic-infrastructure.privileged=<mark>true</mark>: Can be set to false to install a trimmed down version of our integration that does not require extra privileges, such as hostPath mounts or running containers as root. Please note that this will disable detailed process collection from the host. For performance reasons, our logging solution still requires hostPath mounts, regardless of the value of this flag. If this is not allowedin your cluster, you will need to disable the logging solution by specifying logging.enabled=false. prometheus.enabled=true: Will deploy our Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, which automatically collects data from prometheus endpoints present in the cluster. webhook.enabled=true: Will install our minimal webhook, which adds environment variables that, in turn, allows linking applications instrumented with APM with infrastructure data. Our chart has a comprehensive set of flags and tunables that can be edited to configure our solution to your particular needs. For a full list of all the flags that can be configured, please check the chart's README and the default values.yaml file. Install the Kubernetes integration by running the customized command without --debug and --dry-run: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set ksm.enabled= true \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged= true \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy Wait a few seconds, then check that the DaemonSet and pods have been created: kubectl -n newrelic get daemonsets,pods Copy Make sure you see a DaemonSet, and one pod per node for newrelic-infrastructure, as well as one Deployment and one pod for any other component that you have enabled. Install with Helm 2 and nri-bundle (legacy) Installation instructions for Helm 2 Important Helm 2 has been deprecated and New Relic does not recommend using it for deployments. Instructions in this section are provided for legacy systems only. To install using Helm 2: Ensure that Helm 2, including their cluster-side components (i.e. Tiller) are properly installed and configured. Please check the official documentation for more details. Set the cluster where you want to install the agent: kubectl config set-cluster DESIRED_CLUSTER Copy To see the available clusters, run kubectl config get-clusters Make sure that kube-state-metrics is installed on your machine: kubectl get deployment --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy If it's not installed, follow the instructions in the kube-state-metrics GitHub repo to install it. Add the New Relic Helm charts repo: helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. This step uses the --dry-run and --debug switches and therefore the agent is not installed. helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --set licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set config.custom_attributes.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME Copy Install the New Relic Kubernetes integration: helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --set licenseKey=your_new_relic_license_key \\ --set cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set config.custom_attributes.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME Copy Tip Note that the --dry-run and --debug switches have been removed. Wait a few seconds, then check that the DaemonSet and pods have been created: kubectl get daemonsets,pods Copy Make sure you see a DaemonSet, and one pod per node. Helm configuration options When you install or upgrade the Kubernetes integration with Helm using the command line, you can pass your configuration variables with the --set flag. helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --set licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set cluster=YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy A full list of the configuration parameters can be found in the newrelic-infrastructure chart README Upgrade using Helm To update your Kubernetes integration installed via Helm: Update the local chart repository: helm repo update Copy Update the release by running again the appropriate helm upgrade --install ... command in the section above. Monitor services running on Kubernetes After having installed our Kubernetes integration, you can start instrumenting the services than run in your cluster. To learn more about how to do this, please check our Monitor services running on Kubernetes page. Use your Kubernetes data To learn more about how to use your Kubernetes data, please head to our detailed Find and use your Kubernetes data pages. Reduce data ingest Our charts support setting an option to reduce the amount of data ingest, at the cost of dropping detailed information. To enable it, set global.lowDataMode to true in the nri-bundle chart. More details can be found in the chart’s README.",

      "body": "New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our cluster explorer, you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer: The cluster explorer is our powerful, fully visual answer to the challenges associated with running Kubernetes at a large scale. You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the cluster explorer, where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. Predefined alert conditions help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing. Get started: Install the Kubernetes integration We have an automated installer to help you with many types of installations: servers, virtual machines, and unprivileged environments. It can also help you with installations in managed services or platforms, but you'll need to review a few preliminary notes before getting started. Our automated installer will generate either a helm command or a set of plain manifests for you to install. Our automated installer: Allows users to select the cluster name and namespace for the installation. Allows users to selectively enable or disable bundling of Kube-state-metrics, a dependency of the Kubernetes integration. Allows users to seamlessly install our other products related to Kubernetes such as: Kubernetes events monitoring In-cluster prometheus services monitoring Service instrumentation without code changes using Pixie Automatically fills the required properties with the license keys the integration needs to work. Read the install docs Start the installer Tip If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the automated installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Why it matters Governing the complexity of Kubernetes can be challenging; there's so much going on at any given moment, with containers being created and deleted in a matter of minutes, applications crashing, and resources being consumed unexpectedly. Our integration helps you navigate Kubernetes abstractions across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid deployments. In New Relic, you can build your own charts and query all your Kubernetes data, which our integration collects by instrumenting the container orchestration layer. This gives you additional insight into nodes, namespaces, deployments, replica sets, pods, and containers. one.newrelic.com > Dashboards: Using the query builder you can turn any query on Kubernetes data to clear visuals. With the Kubernetes integration you can also: Link your APM data to Kubernetes to measure the performance of your web and mobile applications, with metrics such as request rate, throughput, error rate, and availability. Monitor services running on Kubernetes, such as Apache, NGINX, Cassandra, and many more (see our tutorial for monitoring Redis on Kubernetes). Create new alert policies and alert conditions based on your Kubernetes data, or extend the predefined alert conditions. These features are in addition to the data New Relic already reports for containerized processes running on instrumented hosts. Navigate all your Kubernetes events The Kubernetes events integration, which is installed separately, watches for events happening in your Kubernetes clusters and sends those events to New Relic. Events data is then visualized in the cluster explorer. To set it up, check the Kubernetes events box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes cluster explorer > Events: Browse and filter all your Kubernetes events, and dig into application logs and infrastructure data. Bring your cluster logs to New Relic Our Kubernetes plugin for log monitoring can collect all your cluster's logs and send them to our platform, so that you can set up new alerts and charts. To set it up, check the Log data box in step 3 of our install wizard, or follow the instructions. Check the source code This integration is open source software. That means you can browse its source code and send improvements, or you can create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the README.",

      "body": "With New Relic's Kubernetes integration you can monitor both Kubernetes and the services running on it, such as Cassandra, Redis, MySQL, and other supported services. Get started Our Kubernetes integration comes bundled with some of our on-host integrations (like Cassandra, MySQL, and Apache). This lets you get data for those supported services by adding a section to the Kubernetes integration's configuration, which lives as a ConfigMap inside a manifest. What you need Enable this feature for a service Details about how configuration works For an example of how to monitor Redis running on a Kubernetes PHP Guestbook, see this tutorial. What you need To monitor services running on Kubernetes, you only need a Kubernetes cluster running the Kubernetes integration, version 1.16.0 or higher (install | check version | update).

Configuration options for each integration Select a service to see available config options: Apache Cassandra Couchbase Elasticsearch HAProxy HashiCorp Consul JMX Kafka Memcached MongoDB MySQL NGINX PostgreSQL RabbitMQ Redis SNMP Verify monitoring is enabled: Go to one.newrelic.com > Infrastructure, select Third party services, and then select the service's dashboard. You should see data being reported. Additional notes about enabling services: Enabling multiple services may use more resources than what is set in the resource limits of the Kubernetes integration config file. If this becomes an issue, raise the limit in the resources section. The Kubernetes integration does not automatically update. For best results, regularly update. Monitor services in our Kubernetes integration installed with Helm If you installed our Kubernetes integration using Helm, to monitor services you need to update the existing installation with the new configuration, which contains the services to monitor: helm upgrade --reuse-values -f values.yaml [RELEASE] [CHART] Copy If you use nri-bundle charts, you need to update the children's chart values. Find some examples here. Learn more More resources for learning about configuration: Learn technical details about how configuration works. Learn how to configure monitoring of multiple services with the same config file. See a step-by-step tutorial showing how to monitor a Redis service on Kubernetes. Manually configure service monitoring The enable procedure should be all you need to get monitoring working, but if you run into problems, understanding some technical details about configuration can be helpful. This section goes into more detail about how configuration works. For each service you wish to monitor, you must add a configuration file for that integration to our Kubernetes integration's configuration. This document will cover these subjects: How the service-specific configuration YAML snippet works Adding the service-specific YAML in the Kubernetes integration's config file Adding multiple services to the Kubernetes integration's config file How the service-specific YAML config works Our Kubernetes integration's configuration follows the ConfigMap format. Using a ConfigMap allows us to decouple the configuration for the integrations from the Kubernetes image. The other benefit is that a ConfigMap can be updated automatically without reloading the running container. Because the infrastructure agent uses YAML to configure its associated integrations, ConfigMaps are a good choice for storing YAML. (For more information on config file format, see the Integration config file format.) The Kubernetes integration image comes with an auto-discovery feature that simplifies the configuration of multiple instances of services using a single configuration file. For example, if you have several NGINX instances running, creating an NGINX integration configuration file for every instance would be hard to implement and hard to update. With our auto-discovery option, you can discover and monitor all your NGINX instances with a single configuration file. Each integration has its own specific configuration YAML. Our NGINX integration default config file looks like this: nginx-config.yml: | --- discovery: command: # Use the following optional arguments : # --namespaces: Comma separated list of namespaces to discover pods on # --port: Port used to connect to the kubelet. Default is 10255 # --tls: Use secure (TLS) connection # Custom Example: # exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes --namespaces namespace1,namespace2 --port 10250 --tls # Default exec: /var/db/newrelic-infra/nri-discovery-kubernetes match: label.app: nginx integrations: - name: nri-nginx env: STATUS_URL: http://${discovery.ip}/status STATUS_MODULE: discover METRICS: 1 Copy The above config enables the following: Runs nri-discovery-kubernetes to query the data for the node we are currently on. Parses the data that comes back and looks for any Kubernetes pod that has a Kubernetes container with an app= label with value nginx. For any matches, it attempts to run the NGINX integration. The status URL is built from: The pod's IP address The status page is pulled from the label on K8s pod called status_url This automatic discovery works the same as the container auto-discovery used by the infrastructure agent. For more advanced options, see Container auto-discovery. Add a service YAML to the Kubernetes integration config It's best practice to configure enabled integrations alongside the Kubernetes integration configuration. This is easier than maintaining configuration files for every single service/integration instance. Below is an example of a Kubernetes integration's ConfigMap. The highlighted section shows where an integration configuration YAML (in this case, NGINX) is placed. For more information on discovery:, see Container auto-discovery for on-host integrations. --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: nginx-config.yml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=nginx\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Use the following optional arguments : # --namespaces: Comma separated list of namespaces to discover pods on # --tls: Use secure (TLS) connection # --port: Port used to connect to the kubelet.

Make sure the namespace used is the same one used by the Kubernetes integration manifest. If you haven't changed it in the downloaded manifest file, the value is default. Add multiple services to the same config You can monitor several services using the same Kubernetes integration config file. To do this, add another integration configuration YAML to the same Kubernetes integration config file. Below is the Kubernetes config created in the last section, with a new section for the Cassandra integration's config (highlighted). --- apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: nri-integration-cfg namespace: default data: nginx-config.yml: | --- # Run auto discovery to find pods with label \"app=nginx\" # https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/container-auto-discovery discovery: command: # Run discovery for Kubernetes.

      "body": "Helm is a package manager on top of Kubernetes. It facilitates installation, upgrades, or revision tracking, and it manages dependencies for the services that you install in Kubernetes. To install the integration using Helm, we recommend our Kubernetes automated installer, which will prompt for almost all configuration options and autopopulate secrets and values for you. Additionally, our automated installer also allows to install our integration as plain manifests rather than a Helm release. See Kubernetes integration: install and configure for more details about how to use our automated installer. Start the installer This page describes in more depth how to install and configure the New Relic integration without using the automated installer. Compatibility and requirements Make sure Helm is installed on your machine. We strongly recommend using Helm 3 to manage the Kubernetes integration. Our charts are also compatible with Helm 2, but support for it might be removed in the future. To install the Kubernetes integration using Helm, you will need your New Relic account license key and your Kubernetes cluster's name: Find and copy your New Relic license key. Find the name of your cluster with this command: kubectl config current-context Copy Note this values somewhere safe as you will need them later during the installation process. Install Kubernetes integration with Helm Install with Helm 3 and nri-bundle (recommended) New Relic has several charts for the different components which offer different features for the platform: newrelic-infrastructure: Contains the main Kubernetes integration and the infrastructure agent. This is the core component for the New Relic Kubernetes experience, responsible of reporting most of the data that is surfaced in dashboard and the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer. newrelic-logging: Provides a DaemonSet with New Relic's Fluent Bit output plugin to easily forward your logs to New Relic. nri-kube-events: Collects and reports cluster events (such as kubectl get events) to New Relic. nri-prometheus: New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics Integration, automatically scrapes Prometheus endpoints present in the cluser and reports metrics to New Relic. nri-metadata-injection: Sets up a minimal MutatingAdmissionWebhook that injects a couple of environment to containers. These contain metadata about the cluster and New Relic installation and will be later picked up by applications instrumented using APM, allowing to correlate APM and infrastructure data. nri-statsd: New Relic StatsD integration. Additionally, New Relic provides nri-bundle, a chart which pulls a selectable set of the charts mentioned above. nri-bundle can also install Kube State Metrics and Pixie for you if needed. While it is possible to install those charts separately, we strongly recommend using the nri-bundle chart for Kubernetes deployments, as it ensures that values across all the charts are consistent and provides full control over which components are installed, as well as the possibility to configure all of them as Helm dependencies. This is the same chart that is used and referenced by our automated installer. Installing and configuring nri-bundle with Helm Ensure you are using the appropriate context in the machine where you will run Helm and kubectl: You can check the available contexts with: kubectl config get-contexts Copy And switch to the desired context using: kubectl config use-context CONTEXT_NAME Copy Add the New Relic Helm charts repo: helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. Notice that we are specifying --dry-run and --debug, so nothing will be installed in this step: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set ksm.enabled= true \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged= true \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy Please notice and adjust the following flags: global.licenseKey=<var>YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY</var>: Must be set to a valid License Key for your account. global.cluster=<var>K8S_CLUSTER_NAME</var>: Is used to identify the cluster in the New Relic UI, so should be a descriptive value not used by any other Kubernetes cluster configured in your New Relic account. ksm.enabled=<mark>true</mark>: Setting this to true will automatically install Kube State Metrics (KSM) for you, which is required for our integration to run. You can set this to false if KSM is already present in your cluster, even if it is on a different namespace. newrelic-infrastructure.privileged=<mark>true</mark>: Can be set to false to install a trimmed down version of our integration that does not require extra privileges, such as hostPath mounts or running containers as root. Please note that this will disable detailed process collection from the host. For performance reasons, our logging solution still requires hostPath mounts, regardless of the value of this flag. If this is not allowedin your cluster, you will need to disable the logging solution by specifying logging.enabled=false. prometheus.enabled=true: Will deploy our Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, which automatically collects data from prometheus endpoints present in the cluster. webhook.enabled=true: Will install our minimal webhook, which adds environment variables that, in turn, allows linking applications instrumented with APM with infrastructure data. Our chart has a comprehensive set of flags and tunables that can be edited to configure our solution to your particular needs. For a full list of all the flags that can be configured, please check the chart's README and the default values.yaml file. Install the Kubernetes integration by running the customized command without --debug and --dry-run: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set ksm.enabled= true \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged= true \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy Wait a few seconds, then check that the DaemonSet and pods have been created: kubectl -n newrelic get daemonsets,pods Copy Make sure you see a DaemonSet, and one pod per node for newrelic-infrastructure, as well as one Deployment and one pod for any other component that you have enabled. Install with Helm 2 and nri-bundle (legacy) Installation instructions for Helm 2 Important Helm 2 has been deprecated and New Relic does not recommend using it for deployments. Instructions in this section are provided for legacy systems only. To install using Helm 2: Ensure that Helm 2, including their cluster-side components (i.e. Tiller) are properly installed and configured. Please check the official documentation for more details. Set the cluster where you want to install the agent: kubectl config set-cluster DESIRED_CLUSTER Copy To see the available clusters, run kubectl config get-clusters Make sure that kube-state-metrics is installed on your machine: kubectl get deployment --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy If it's not installed, follow the instructions in the kube-state-metrics GitHub repo to install it. Add the New Relic Helm charts repo: helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. This step uses the --dry-run and --debug switches and therefore the agent is not installed. helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --set licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set config.custom_attributes.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME Copy Install the New Relic Kubernetes integration: helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --set licenseKey=your_new_relic_license_key \\ --set cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set config.custom_attributes.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME Copy Tip Note that the --dry-run and --debug switches have been removed. Wait a few seconds, then check that the DaemonSet and pods have been created: kubectl get daemonsets,pods Copy Make sure you see a DaemonSet, and one pod per node. Helm configuration options When you install or upgrade the Kubernetes integration with Helm using the command line, you can pass your configuration variables with the --set flag. helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --set licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set cluster=YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy A full list of the configuration parameters can be found in the newrelic-infrastructure chart README Upgrade using Helm To update your Kubernetes integration installed via Helm: Update the local chart repository: helm repo update Copy Update the release by running again the appropriate helm upgrade --install ... command in the section above. Monitor services running on Kubernetes After having installed our Kubernetes integration, you can start instrumenting the services than run in your cluster. To learn more about how to do this, please check our Monitor services running on Kubernetes page. Use your Kubernetes data To learn more about how to use your Kubernetes data, please head to our detailed Find and use your Kubernetes data pages.

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Looking to install our New Relic One integration with Pixie for fine-grained telemetry data? See our Auto-telemetry with Pixie install instructions to get deeper insight into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads with just one install command. No language agents required. Want to try out our Kubernetes integration? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Use automated installer We encourage you to use our automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The automated installer can provide you either a Helm command with the required values filled, or a plain manifest if you do not wish to use Helm. It also features great customizability and full control over which features and dependencies are enabled. If you are installing our integration on a managed cloud, please take a look at these preliminary notes before proceeding. Alternatively, we also offer fully manual instructions for deploying our integration using Helm. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate Installation on EKS Fargate clusters requires dedicated steps, which are detailed in our fargate installation docs. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: Copy name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME YAML key path: `spec.template.spec.containers.name.env` Copy Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Upgrading our Kubernetes integration Our Kubernetes integration is under active development and we regularly release updates which include bug fixes, new features, and support for newer Kubernetes versions and cloud providers. We strongly recommend all our customers to regularly update the Kubernetes integration to get the best experience. Upgrading using the automated installer and Helm In order to update an installation that was deployed using Helm command provided by the automated installer, just go through the process and run the Helm command again. This will pull the new version of the chart and its dependencies and upgrade it to the latest version. Upgrading using the automated installer and plain manifests Tip We encourage you to deploy our integration using Helm, as it provides a cleaner upgrade path comapred to using manifests directly. If custom manifests have been used instead of Helm, we encourage you to first remove the old installation using kubectl delete -f <mark>previous-manifest-file.yml</mark>, and then proceed through the guided installer again. This will generate an updated set of manifests that can be deployed using kubectl apply -f <mark>manifest-file.yml</mark>. We do not recommend applying a new version of the manifest file without removing the previous one first, since it might leave some leftover components in your cluster. Monitor services running on Kubernetes Tip We encourage you to deploy our integration using Helm, as it allows easier configuration on how to monitor services by just adding snippets to your values.yml file. After having installed our Kubernetes integration, you can start instrumenting the services than run in your cluster. To learn more about how to do this, please check our Monitor services running on Kubernetes page.

      "body": "LIMITED RELEASE This feature is a limited release. To run our Kubernetes installation for Windows, follow the steps below to: Check the compatibility and requirements. Update the manifest file. Learn about the limitations of the integration. Compatibility and requirements Before you install New Relic's Kubernetes integration, review the compatibility and requirements. Important When using containers in Windows, the container host version and the container image version must be the same. Our Kubernetes integration supports Windows versions 1809 and 1909. To check your Windows version: Open a command window. Run the following command: Reg Query \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\" /v ReleaseIdcmd.exe Copy Example: Get Kubernetes for Windows from a BusyBox container. $ kubectl exec -it busybox1-766bb4d6cc-rmsnj -- Reg Query \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\" /v ReleaseId Copy HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion ReleaseId REG_SZ 1809 Copy Install You can install the Kubernetes integration for Windows using Helm. See an example on how to install the integration in a cluster with nodes having different build versions of Windows (1809 and 2004): Install kube-state-metrics and run it in your cluster using this snippet: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics-1.9.5.zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v1.9.5.zip && unzip kube-state-metrics-1.9.5.zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics-1.9.5/examples/standard Copy Create a values.yml file with the follow data to be used by Helm: global: licenseKey: <YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> cluster: <YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME> enableLinux: false enableWindows: true windowsOsList: - version: 1809 imageTag: 2.2.0-windows-1809-alpha buildNumber: 10.0.17763 - version: 2004 imageTag: 2.2.0-windows-2004-alpha buildNumber: 10.0.19041 Copy Install the integration with: helm install <YOUR_INSTALL_NAME> newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure -f values.yml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy The Helm chart will create one DeamonSet per each version of Windows that is in the list and use NodeSelector to deploy the corresponding Pod per Node. Limitations The following limitations apply to the Kubernetes integration for Windows: The Windows agent only sends the Kubernetes samples (K8sNodeSample, K8sPodSample, etc.) SystemSample, StorageSample, NetworkSample, and ProcessSample are not generated. Some Kubernetes metrics are missing because the Windows kubelet doesn’t have them: Node: fsInodes: not sent fsInodesFree: not sent fsInodesUsed: not sent memoryMajorPageFaultsPerSecond: always returns zero as a value memoryPageFaults: always returns zero as a value memoryRssBytes: always returns zero as a value runtimeInodes: not sent runtimeInodesFree: not sent runtimeInodesUsed: not sent Pod: net.errorsPerSecond: not sent net.rxBytesPerSecond: not sent net.txBytesPerSecond: not sent Container: containerID: not sent containerImageID: not sent memoryUsedBytes: in the UI, this is displayed in the pod card that appears when you click on a pod, and will show no data. We will soon fix this by updating our charts to use memoryWorkingSetBytes instead. Volume: fsUsedBytes: zero, so fsUsedPercent is zero Known issues with the Windows Kubelet There are a couple of issues with the Windows version of Kubelet that can prevent the integration from fetching data: Issue 90554: This issue makes the Kubelet return 500 errors when the integration makes a request to the /stats/summary endpoint. It will be included in the Kubernetes 1.19 release and has been backported to the releases 1.16.11, 1.17.7, and 1.18.4. There is no solution on the integration side for this problem, we advise you to update to one of the patch versions as soon as possible. You can see if you're being affected by this problem by enabling verbose logs and looking for messages of the type: error querying Kubelet. Get \"https://<KUBELET_IP>/stats/summary\": error calling kubelet endpoint. Got status code: 500 Copy Issue 87730: This issue makes the Kubelet metrics very slow when running minimal load. It makes the integration fail with a timeout error. A patch for this issue has been added for Kubernetes 1.18 and backported to 1.15.12, 1.16.9, and 1.17.5. We advise you to update to one of the patch versions as soon as possible. To mitigate this issue you can increase the integration timeout with the TIMEOUT config option. You can see if you're being affected by this problem by enabling verbose logs and looking for messages of the type: error querying Kubelet. Get \"https://<KUBELET_IP>/stats/summary\": context deadline exceeded (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers) Copy",

      "body": "Helm is a package manager on top of Kubernetes. It facilitates installation, upgrades, or revision tracking, and it manages dependencies for the services that you install in Kubernetes. To install the integration using Helm, we recommend our Kubernetes automated installer, which will prompt for almost all configuration options and autopopulate secrets and values for you. Additionally, our automated installer also allows to install our integration as plain manifests rather than a Helm release. See Kubernetes integration: install and configure for more details about how to use our automated installer. Start the installer This page describes in more depth how to install and configure the New Relic integration without using the automated installer. Compatibility and requirements Make sure Helm is installed on your machine. We strongly recommend using Helm 3 to manage the Kubernetes integration. Our charts are also compatible with Helm 2, but support for it might be removed in the future. To install the Kubernetes integration using Helm, you will need your New Relic account license key and your Kubernetes cluster's name: Find and copy your New Relic license key. Find the name of your cluster with this command: kubectl config current-context Copy Note this values somewhere safe as you will need them later during the installation process. Install Kubernetes integration with Helm Install with Helm 3 and nri-bundle (recommended) New Relic has several charts for the different components which offer different features for the platform: newrelic-infrastructure: Contains the main Kubernetes integration and the infrastructure agent. This is the core component for the New Relic Kubernetes experience, responsible of reporting most of the data that is surfaced in dashboard and the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer. newrelic-logging: Provides a DaemonSet with New Relic's Fluent Bit output plugin to easily forward your logs to New Relic. nri-kube-events: Collects and reports cluster events (such as kubectl get events) to New Relic. nri-prometheus: New Relic's Prometheus OpenMetrics Integration, automatically scrapes Prometheus endpoints present in the cluser and reports metrics to New Relic. nri-metadata-injection: Sets up a minimal MutatingAdmissionWebhook that injects a couple of environment to containers. These contain metadata about the cluster and New Relic installation and will be later picked up by applications instrumented using APM, allowing to correlate APM and infrastructure data. nri-statsd: New Relic StatsD integration. Additionally, New Relic provides nri-bundle, a chart which pulls a selectable set of the charts mentioned above. nri-bundle can also install Kube State Metrics and Pixie for you if needed. While it is possible to install those charts separately, we strongly recommend using the nri-bundle chart for Kubernetes deployments, as it ensures that values across all the charts are consistent and provides full control over which components are installed, as well as the possibility to configure all of them as Helm dependencies. This is the same chart that is used and referenced by our automated installer. Installing and configuring nri-bundle with Helm Ensure you are using the appropriate context in the machine where you will run Helm and kubectl: You can check the available contexts with: kubectl config get-contexts Copy And switch to the desired context using: kubectl config use-context CONTEXT_NAME Copy Add the New Relic Helm charts repo: helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. Notice that we are specifying --dry-run and --debug, so nothing will be installed in this step: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set ksm.enabled= true \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged= true \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy Please notice and adjust the following flags: global.licenseKey=<var>YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY</var>: Must be set to a valid License Key for your account. global.cluster=<var>K8S_CLUSTER_NAME</var>: Is used to identify the cluster in the New Relic UI, so should be a descriptive value not used by any other Kubernetes cluster configured in your New Relic account. ksm.enabled=<mark>true</mark>: Setting this to true will automatically install Kube State Metrics (KSM) for you, which is required for our integration to run. You can set this to false if KSM is already present in your cluster, even if it is on a different namespace. newrelic-infrastructure.privileged=<mark>true</mark>: Can be set to false to install a trimmed down version of our integration that does not require extra privileges, such as hostPath mounts or running containers as root. Please note that this will disable detailed process collection from the host. For performance reasons, our logging solution still requires hostPath mounts, regardless of the value of this flag. If this is not allowedin your cluster, you will need to disable the logging solution by specifying logging.enabled=false. prometheus.enabled=true: Will deploy our Prometheus OpenMetrics integration, which automatically collects data from prometheus endpoints present in the cluster. webhook.enabled=true: Will install our minimal webhook, which adds environment variables that, in turn, allows linking applications instrumented with APM with infrastructure data. Our chart has a comprehensive set of flags and tunables that can be edited to configure our solution to your particular needs. For a full list of all the flags that can be configured, please check the chart's README and the default values.yaml file. Install the Kubernetes integration by running the customized command without --debug and --dry-run: helm upgrade --install newrelic newrelic/nri-bundle \\ --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \\ --set global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set ksm.enabled= true \\ --set newrelic-infrastructure.privileged= true \\ --set infrastructure.enabled=true \\ --set prometheus.enabled=true \\ --set webhook.enabled=true \\ --set kubeEvents.enabled=true \\ --set logging.enabled=true Copy Wait a few seconds, then check that the DaemonSet and pods have been created: kubectl -n newrelic get daemonsets,pods Copy Make sure you see a DaemonSet, and one pod per node for newrelic-infrastructure, as well as one Deployment and one pod for any other component that you have enabled. Install with Helm 2 and nri-bundle (legacy) Installation instructions for Helm 2 Important Helm 2 has been deprecated and New Relic does not recommend using it for deployments. Instructions in this section are provided for legacy systems only. To install using Helm 2: Ensure that Helm 2, including their cluster-side components (i.e. Tiller) are properly installed and configured. Please check the official documentation for more details. Set the cluster where you want to install the agent: kubectl config set-cluster DESIRED_CLUSTER Copy To see the available clusters, run kubectl config get-clusters Make sure that kube-state-metrics is installed on your machine: kubectl get deployment --all-namespaces | grep kube-state-metrics Copy If it's not installed, follow the instructions in the kube-state-metrics GitHub repo to install it. Add the New Relic Helm charts repo: helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com Copy Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. This step uses the --dry-run and --debug switches and therefore the agent is not installed. helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --dry-run \\ --debug \\ --set licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set config.custom_attributes.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME Copy Install the New Relic Kubernetes integration: helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --set licenseKey=your_new_relic_license_key \\ --set cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME \\ --set config.custom_attributes.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME Copy Tip Note that the --dry-run and --debug switches have been removed. Wait a few seconds, then check that the DaemonSet and pods have been created: kubectl get daemonsets,pods Copy Make sure you see a DaemonSet, and one pod per node. Helm configuration options When you install or upgrade the Kubernetes integration with Helm using the command line, you can pass your configuration variables with the --set flag. helm install newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure \\ --set licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY \\ --set cluster=YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME Copy A full list of the configuration parameters can be found in the newrelic-infrastructure chart README Upgrade using Helm To update your Kubernetes integration installed via Helm: Update the local chart repository: helm repo update Copy Update the release by running again the appropriate helm upgrade --install ... command in the section above. Monitor services running on Kubernetes After having installed our Kubernetes integration, you can start instrumenting the services than run in your cluster. To learn more about how to do this, please check our Monitor services running on Kubernetes page. Use your Kubernetes data To learn more about how to use your Kubernetes data, please head to our detailed Find and use your Kubernetes data pages. Reduce data ingest Our charts support setting an option to reduce the amount of data ingest, at the cost of dropping detailed information. To enable it, set global.lowDataMode to true in the nri-bundle chart. More details can be found in the chart’s README.",

      "body": "The easiest way to install the Kubernetes integration is to use our automated installer to generate a manifest. It bundles not just the integration DaemonSets, but also other New Relic Kubernetes configurations, like Kubernetes events, Prometheus OpenMetrics, and New Relic log monitoring. Looking to install our New Relic One integration with Pixie for fine-grained telemetry data? See our Auto-telemetry with Pixie install instructions to get deeper insight into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads with just one install command. No language agents required. Want to try out our Kubernetes integration? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Use automated installer We encourage you to use our automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The automated installer can provide you either a Helm command with the required values filled, or a plain manifest if you do not wish to use Helm. It also features great customizability and full control over which features and dependencies are enabled. If you are installing our integration on a managed cloud, please take a look at these preliminary notes before proceeding. Alternatively, we also offer fully manual instructions for deploying our integration using Helm. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate Installation on EKS Fargate clusters requires dedicated steps, which are detailed in our fargate installation docs. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: Copy name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME YAML key path: `spec.template.spec.containers.name.env` Copy Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Upgrading our Kubernetes integration Our Kubernetes integration is under active development and we regularly release updates which include bug fixes, new features, and support for newer Kubernetes versions and cloud providers. We strongly recommend all our customers to regularly update the Kubernetes integration to get the best experience. Upgrading using the automated installer and Helm In order to update an installation that was deployed using Helm command provided by the automated installer, just go through the process and run the Helm command again. This will pull the new version of the chart and its dependencies and upgrade it to the latest version. Upgrading using the automated installer and plain manifests Tip We encourage you to deploy our integration using Helm, as it provides a cleaner upgrade path comapred to using manifests directly. If custom manifests have been used instead of Helm, we encourage you to first remove the old installation using kubectl delete -f <mark>previous-manifest-file.yml</mark>, and then proceed through the guided installer again. This will generate an updated set of manifests that can be deployed using kubectl apply -f <mark>manifest-file.yml</mark>. We do not recommend applying a new version of the manifest file without removing the previous one first, since it might leave some leftover components in your cluster. Monitor services running on Kubernetes Tip We encourage you to deploy our integration using Helm, as it allows easier configuration on how to monitor services by just adding snippets to your values.yml file. After having installed our Kubernetes integration, you can start instrumenting the services than run in your cluster. To learn more about how to do this, please check our Monitor services running on Kubernetes page.

Controller manager: resident memory size, number of OS threads created, goroutines currently existing, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Controller manager data. Compatibility and requirements Control plane monitoring requires Kubernetes integration version 1.11.0 or higher. Control plane monitoring support is not enabled for managed clusters. This is because providers (EKS, GKE, AKS, etc.) abstract away the concept of master nodes and control plane components, so that access to them is limited or non-existent. External control planes are not supported. The unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration does not support control plane monitoring. OpenShift 4.x uses control plane component metric endpoints that are different than the default. Discovery of master nodes and control plane components The Kubernetes integration relies on the kubeadm labeling conventions to discover the master nodes and the control plane components. This means that master nodes should be labeled with node-role.kubernetes.io/master=\"\" or kubernetes.io/role=\"master\". The control plane components should have either the k8s-app or the tier and component labels. Refer to the following table for accepted label combinations and values: Component Label Endpoint API server Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-apiserver tier=control-plane component=kube-apiserver OpenShift app=openshift-kube-apiserver apiserver=true localhost:443/metrics by default (can be configured) if the request fails falls back to localhost:8080/metrics ETCD Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=etcd-manager-main tier=control-plane component=etcd OpenShift k8s-app=etcd localhost:4001/metrics Scheduler Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-scheduler tier=control-plane component=kube-scheduler OpenShift app=openshift-kube-scheduler scheduler=true localhost:10251/metrics Controller manager Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-controller-manager tier=control-plane component=kube-controller-manager​ OpenShift app=kube-controller-manager kube-controller-manager=true localhost:10252/metrics When the integration detects that it is running inside a master node, it tries to find which components are running on the node by looking for pods that match the labels listed in the table above. For every running component, the integration makes a request to its metrics endpoint. Configuration Control plane monitoring is automatic for agents running inside master nodes. The only component that requires an extra step to run is ETCD, because it uses mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) for client requests. The API Server can also be configured to be queried using the Secure Port. Important Control plane monitoring for OpenShift 4.x requires additional configuration. For more information, see the OpenShift 4.x Configuration section. ETCD In order to set mTLS for querying ETCD, there are two configuration options that need to be set: Option Value ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME Name of a Kubernetes secret that contains the mTLS configuration. The secret should contain the following keys: cert: the certificate that identifies the client making the request. It should be signed by an ETCD trusted CA. key: the private key used to generate the client certificate. cacert: the root CA used to identify the ETCD server certificate. If the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME option is not set, ETCD metrics won't be fetched. For step by step instructions on how to create a certificate and sign it with the ETCD client CA, see Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE The namespace where the secret specified in the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME was created. If not set, the default namespace is used. API server By default, the API server metrics are queried using the localhost:8080 unsecured endpoint. If this port is disabled, you can also query these metrics over the secure port. To enable this, set the following configuration option in the Kubernetes integration manifest file: Option Value API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL The (secure) URL to query the metrics. The API server uses localhost:443 by default Ensure that the ClusterRole has been updated to the newest version found in the manifest Added in version 1.15.0 Important Note that the port can be different according to the secure port used by the API server. For example, in Minikube the API server secure port is 8443 and therefore API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL should be set to https://localhost:8443 OpenShift configuration Control plane components on OpenShift 4.x use endpoint URLs that require SSL and service account based authentication. Therefore, the default endpoint URLs can not be used. To configure control plane monitoring on OpenShift, uncomment the following environment variables in the customized manifest. URL values are pre-configured to the default base URLs for the control plane monitoring metrics endpoints in OpenShift 4.x. - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259 - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy Important Even though the custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL is defined, ETCD requires HTTPS and mTLS authentication to be configured. For more on configuring mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. Important When installing through Helm openshift, specify the config to automatically include these endpoints. Setting openshift.enabled=true and openshift.version=\"4.x\" will include the secure endpoints and enable the /var/run/crio.sock runtime. Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA The instructions below are based on the Kubernetes documentation. For more information, see Managing TLS certificates in a cluster. For OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. To set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA: Download and install the tool cfssl, selecting the correct binaries for your OS from the list. Once installed, execute the following command: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy This command generates two files; server.csr containing the PEM encoded pkcs#10 certification request and server-key.pem containing the PEM encoded key to the certificate to be created. Use the generated certificate authority (CA) of ETCD to sign your CSR. Depending on your cluster configuration, you may already have this information. For default install configuration, download the CA certificate and the private key directly from ETCD with the following commands: kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system Copy Tip This requires that the etcd-manager-main pod has the label k8s-app=etcd-manager-main, which is a requirement for control plane monitoring . If your etc-manager-main pod is located in a different namespace, change the -n kube-system flags accordingly. With those files downloaded, use the following command to sign your CSRF: cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert Copy Create the secret that is used to retrieve the TLS config for making requests to ETC. We recommend renaming the certificate and the private key: cp cert.pem cert && cp server-key.pem key Copy kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert Copy To ease future installations Use the following commands to simultaneously create the CSR, retrieve the CA, generate the certificate by signing the CSR, and create the secret with all the required fields: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system && \\ cp server-key.pem key && \\ cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert && \\ cp cert.pem cert && \\ kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy The last step is to update the configuration in the manifest and apply it. In the configuration section, there are two options related to ETCD mTLS: ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME with the name of the secret that we just created. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE with the namespace that we used to create the secret. To complete the installation, add these variables to the container spec of the integration DaemonSet and apply the changes: - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME” value: \"newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret\" - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE\" value: \"default\" Copy Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift Follow these instructions to set up mutual TLS authentication for ETCD in OpenShift 4.x: Export the ETCD client certificates from the cluster to an opaque secret. In a default managed OpenShift cluster, the secret is named kube-etcd-client-certs and it is stored in the openshift-monitoring namespace. kubectl get secret/kube-etcd-client-certs -n openshift-monitoring -o yaml > etcd-secret.yaml Copy Open the secret file and change the keys: Rename the certificate authority to cacert. Rename the client certificate to cert. Rename the client key to key. Optional: change the secret name and namespace to something meaningful. Remove these unnecessary keys in the metadata section: creationTimestamp resourceVersion selfLink uid Install the manifest with its new name and namespace: kubectl apply -f etcd-secret.yaml Copy Go to Update manifest configuration (the last step under Set up MTL from ETCD client) to configure the required environment variables.

See our Auto-telemetry with Pixie install instructions to get deeper insight into your Kubernetes clusters and workloads with just one install command. No language agents required. Want to try out our Kubernetes integration? Create a New Relic account for free! No credit card required. Use automated installer We encourage you to use our automated installer for servers, VMs, and unprivileged environments. The automated installer can provide you either a Helm command with the required values filled, or a plain manifest if you do not wish to use Helm. It also features great customizability and full control over which features and dependencies are enabled. If you are installing our integration on a managed cloud, please take a look at these preliminary notes before proceeding. Alternatively, we also offer fully manual instructions for deploying our integration using Helm. Start the installer If your New Relic account is in the EU region, access the installer from one.eu.newrelic.com. Installs for managed services and platforms Before starting our automated installer, check out these notes for your managed services or platforms: Amazon EKS The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Amazon EKS, master nodes are managed by Amazon and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration in Amazon EKS, make sure you are using the version of kubectl provided by AWS. Amazon EKS Fargate Installation on EKS Fargate clusters requires dedicated steps, which are detailed in our fargate installation docs. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In GKE, master nodes are managed by Google and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. Before starting our automated installer to deploy the Kubernetes integration on GKE, ensure you have sufficient permissions: Go to console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam and find your username. Click edit. Ensure you have permissions to create Roles and ClusterRoles: If you are not sure, add the Kubernetes Engine Cluster Admin role. If you cannot edit your user role, ask the owner of the GCP project to give you the necessary permissions. OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle.

Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Upgrading our Kubernetes integration Our Kubernetes integration is under active development and we regularly release updates which include bug fixes, new features, and support for newer Kubernetes versions and cloud providers. We strongly recommend all our customers to regularly update the Kubernetes integration to get the best experience. Upgrading using the automated installer and Helm In order to update an installation that was deployed using Helm command provided by the automated installer, just go through the process and run the Helm command again. This will pull the new version of the chart and its dependencies and upgrade it to the latest version. Upgrading using the automated installer and plain manifests Tip We encourage you to deploy our integration using Helm, as it provides a cleaner upgrade path comapred to using manifests directly. If custom manifests have been used instead of Helm, we encourage you to first remove the old installation using kubectl delete -f <mark>previous-manifest-file.yml</mark>, and then proceed through the guided installer again. This will generate an updated set of manifests that can be deployed using kubectl apply -f <mark>manifest-file.yml</mark>. We do not recommend applying a new version of the manifest file without removing the previous one first, since it might leave some leftover components in your cluster. Monitor services running on Kubernetes Tip We encourage you to deploy our integration using Helm, as it allows easier configuration on how to monitor services by just adding snippets to your values.yml file. After having installed our Kubernetes integration, you can start instrumenting the services than run in your cluster.

OpenShift container platform To deploy the Kubernetes integration with OpenShift: Add the <>{'<release_name>'}</>-newrelic-infrastructure service account to your privileged Security Context Constraints: oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged \\ system:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<release_name>-newrelic-infrastructure Copy The default <>{'<release_name>'}</> provided by the installer is nri-bundle. Complete the steps in our automated installer. If you're using signed certificates, make sure they are properly configured by using the following variables in the DaemonSet portion of your manifest to set the .pem file: Copy name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_DIR value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_DIR name: NRIA_CA_BUNDLE_FILE value: YOUR_CA_BUNDLE_NAME YAML key path: `spec.template.spec.containers.name.env` Copy Save your changes. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) The Kubernetes integration monitors worker nodes. In Azure Kubernetes Service, master nodes are managed by Azure and abstracted from the Kubernetes platforms. To deploy in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), complete the steps in our automated installer. Pivotal Container Service (PKS / VMware Tanzu) To deploy in PKS, we recommend that you use the automated installer, or you can follow the manual instructions provided in Install the Kubernetes integration using Helm. Upgrading our Kubernetes integration Our Kubernetes integration is under active development and we regularly release updates which include bug fixes, new features, and support for newer Kubernetes versions and cloud providers. We strongly recommend all our customers to regularly update the Kubernetes integration to get the best experience. Upgrading using the automated installer and Helm In order to update an installation that was deployed using Helm command provided by the automated installer, just go through the process and run the Helm command again. This will pull the new version of the chart and its dependencies and upgrade it to the latest version. Upgrading using the automated installer and plain manifests Tip We encourage you to deploy our integration using Helm, as it provides a cleaner upgrade path comapred to using manifests directly. If custom manifests have been used instead of Helm, we encourage you to first remove the old installation using kubectl delete -f <mark>previous-manifest-file.yml</mark>, and then proceed through the guided installer again. This will generate an updated set of manifests that can be deployed using kubectl apply -f <mark>manifest-file.yml</mark>. We do not recommend applying a new version of the manifest file without removing the previous one first, since it might leave some leftover components in your cluster. Monitor services running on Kubernetes Tip We encourage you to deploy our integration using Helm, as it allows easier configuration on how to monitor services by just adding snippets to your values.yml file. After having installed our Kubernetes integration, you can start instrumenting the services than run in your cluster. To learn more about how to do this, please check our Monitor services running on Kubernetes page. Use your Kubernetes data To learn more about how to use your Kubernetes data, please head to our detailed Find and use your Kubernetes data pages.",

      "body": "New Relic provides Control Plane support for your Kubernetes integration, allowing you to monitor and collect metrics from your cluster's Control Plane components. That data can then be found in New Relic and used to create queries and charts. Features We monitor and collect metrics from the following control plane components: ETCD: leader information, resident memory size, number of OS threads, consensus proposals data, etc. For a list of supported metrics, see ETCD data. API server: rate of apiserver requests, breakdown of apiserver requests by HTTP method and response code, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see API server data. Scheduler: requested CPU/memory vs available on the node, tolerations to taints, any set affinity or anti-affinity, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Scheduler data. Controller manager: resident memory size, number of OS threads created, goroutines currently existing, etc. For the complete list of supported metrics, see Controller manager data. Compatibility and requirements Control plane monitoring requires Kubernetes integration version 1.11.0 or higher. Control plane monitoring support is not enabled for managed clusters. This is because providers (EKS, GKE, AKS, etc.) abstract away the concept of master nodes and control plane components, so that access to them is limited or non-existent. External control planes are not supported. The unprivileged version of the Kubernetes integration does not support control plane monitoring. OpenShift 4.x uses control plane component metric endpoints that are different than the default. Discovery of master nodes and control plane components The Kubernetes integration relies on the kubeadm labeling conventions to discover the master nodes and the control plane components. This means that master nodes should be labeled with node-role.kubernetes.io/master=\"\" or kubernetes.io/role=\"master\". The control plane components should have either the k8s-app or the tier and component labels. Refer to the following table for accepted label combinations and values: Component Label Endpoint API server Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-apiserver tier=control-plane component=kube-apiserver OpenShift app=openshift-kube-apiserver apiserver=true localhost:443/metrics by default (can be configured) if the request fails falls back to localhost:8080/metrics ETCD Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=etcd-manager-main tier=control-plane component=etcd OpenShift k8s-app=etcd localhost:4001/metrics Scheduler Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-scheduler tier=control-plane component=kube-scheduler OpenShift app=openshift-kube-scheduler scheduler=true localhost:10251/metrics Controller manager Kubeadm / Kops / ClusterAPI k8s-app=kube-controller-manager tier=control-plane component=kube-controller-manager​ OpenShift app=kube-controller-manager kube-controller-manager=true localhost:10252/metrics When the integration detects that it is running inside a master node, it tries to find which components are running on the node by looking for pods that match the labels listed in the table above. For every running component, the integration makes a request to its metrics endpoint. Configuration Control plane monitoring is automatic for agents running inside master nodes. The only component that requires an extra step to run is ETCD, because it uses mutual TLS authentication (mTLS) for client requests. The API Server can also be configured to be queried using the Secure Port. Important Control plane monitoring for OpenShift 4.x requires additional configuration. For more information, see the OpenShift 4.x Configuration section. ETCD In order to set mTLS for querying ETCD, there are two configuration options that need to be set: Option Value ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME Name of a Kubernetes secret that contains the mTLS configuration. The secret should contain the following keys: cert: the certificate that identifies the client making the request. It should be signed by an ETCD trusted CA. key: the private key used to generate the client certificate. cacert: the root CA used to identify the ETCD server certificate. If the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME option is not set, ETCD metrics won't be fetched. For step by step instructions on how to create a certificate and sign it with the ETCD client CA, see Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE The namespace where the secret specified in the ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME was created. If not set, the default namespace is used. API server By default, the API server metrics are queried using the localhost:8080 unsecured endpoint. If this port is disabled, you can also query these metrics over the secure port. To enable this, set the following configuration option in the Kubernetes integration manifest file: Option Value API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL The (secure) URL to query the metrics. The API server uses localhost:443 by default Ensure that the ClusterRole has been updated to the newest version found in the manifest Added in version 1.15.0 Important Note that the port can be different according to the secure port used by the API server. For example, in Minikube the API server secure port is 8443 and therefore API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL should be set to https://localhost:8443 OpenShift configuration Control plane components on OpenShift 4.x use endpoint URLs that require SSL and service account based authentication. Therefore, the default endpoint URLs can not be used. To configure control plane monitoring on OpenShift, uncomment the following environment variables in the customized manifest. URL values are pre-configured to the default base URLs for the control plane monitoring metrics endpoints in OpenShift 4.x. - name: \"SCHEDULER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10259 - name: \"ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:9979\" - name: \"CONTROLLER_MANAGER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:10257\" - name: \"API_SERVER_ENDPOINT_URL\" value: \"https://localhost:6443\" Copy Important Even though the custom ETCD_ENDPOINT_URL is defined, ETCD requires HTTPS and mTLS authentication to be configured. For more on configuring mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. Important When installing through Helm openshift, specify the config to automatically include these endpoints. Setting openshift.enabled=true and openshift.version=\"4.x\" will include the secure endpoints and enable the /var/run/crio.sock runtime. Set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA The instructions below are based on the Kubernetes documentation. For more information, see Managing TLS certificates in a cluster. For OpenShift, see Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift. To set up mTLS from the ETCD client CA: Download and install the tool cfssl, selecting the correct binaries for your OS from the list. Once installed, execute the following command: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy This command generates two files; server.csr containing the PEM encoded pkcs#10 certification request and server-key.pem containing the PEM encoded key to the certificate to be created. Use the generated certificate authority (CA) of ETCD to sign your CSR. Depending on your cluster configuration, you may already have this information. For default install configuration, download the CA certificate and the private key directly from ETCD with the following commands: kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system Copy Tip This requires that the etcd-manager-main pod has the label k8s-app=etcd-manager-main, which is a requirement for control plane monitoring . If your etc-manager-main pod is located in a different namespace, change the -n kube-system flags accordingly. With those files downloaded, use the following command to sign your CSRF: cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert Copy Create the secret that is used to retrieve the TLS config for making requests to ETC. We recommend renaming the certificate and the private key: cp cert.pem cert && cp server-key.pem key Copy kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert Copy To ease future installations Use the following commands to simultaneously create the CSR, retrieve the CA, generate the certificate by signing the CSR, and create the secret with all the required fields: cat <<EOF | cfssl genkey - | cfssljson -bare server && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.crt ./cacert -n kube-system && \\ kubectl cp $(kubectl get pods -l k8s-app=etcd-manager-main -n kube-system -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\"):/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd-manager/etcd-clients-ca.key ./cacert.key -n kube-system && \\ cp server-key.pem key && \\ cfssl sign -ca cacert -ca-key cacert.key server.csr | cfssljson -bare cert && \\ cp cert.pem cert && \\ kubectl -n default create secret generic newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret --from-file=./cert --from-file=./key --from-file=./cacert { \"hosts\": [ \"localhost\" ], \"CN\": \"newrelic-infra.pod.cluster.local\", \"key\": { \"algo\": \"ecdsa\", \"size\": 256 } } EOF Copy The last step is to update the configuration in the manifest and apply it. In the configuration section, there are two options related to ETCD mTLS: ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME with the name of the secret that we just created. ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE with the namespace that we used to create the secret. To complete the installation, add these variables to the container spec of the integration DaemonSet and apply the changes: - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAME” value: \"newrelic-infra-etcd-tls-secret\" - name: \"ETCD_TLS_SECRET_NAMESPACE\" value: \"default\" Copy Set up mTLS for ETCD in OpenShift Follow these instructions to set up mutual TLS authentication for ETCD in OpenShift 4.x: Export the ETCD client certificates from the cluster to an opaque secret. In a default managed OpenShift cluster, the secret is named kube-etcd-client-certs and it is stored in the openshift-monitoring namespace. kubectl get secret/kube-etcd-client-certs -n openshift-monitoring -o yaml > etcd-secret.yaml Copy Open the secret file and change the keys: Rename the certificate authority to cacert. Rename the client certificate to cert. Rename the client key to key. Optional: change the secret name and namespace to something meaningful. Remove these unnecessary keys in the metadata section: creationTimestamp resourceVersion selfLink uid Install the manifest with its new name and namespace: kubectl apply -f etcd-secret.yaml Copy Go to Update manifest configuration (the last step under Set up MTL from ETCD client) to configure the required environment variables. See your data If the integration has been been set up correctly, the Kubernetes cluster explorer contains all the Control Plane components and their status in a dedicated section, as shown below. one.newrelic.com > Kubernetes Cluster Explorer: Use the Kubernetes cluster explorer to monitor and collect metrics from your cluster's Control Plane components You can also check for Control Plane data with this NRQL query: SELECT latest(timestamp) FROM K8sApiServerSample, K8sEtcdSample, K8sSchedulerSample, K8sControllerManagerSample FACET entityName where clusterName = 'MY_CLUSTER_NAME' Copy Tip If you still can't see Control Plane data, try the solution described in Kubernetes integration troubleshooting: Not seeing data.",

      "body": "LIMITED RELEASE This feature is a limited release. To run our Kubernetes installation for Windows, follow the steps below to: Check the compatibility and requirements. Update the manifest file. Learn about the limitations of the integration. Compatibility and requirements Before you install New Relic's Kubernetes integration, review the compatibility and requirements. Important When using containers in Windows, the container host version and the container image version must be the same. Our Kubernetes integration supports Windows versions 1809 and 1909. To check your Windows version: Open a command window. Run the following command: Reg Query \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\" /v ReleaseIdcmd.exe Copy Example: Get Kubernetes for Windows from a BusyBox container. $ kubectl exec -it busybox1-766bb4d6cc-rmsnj -- Reg Query \"HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\" /v ReleaseId Copy HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion ReleaseId REG_SZ 1809 Copy Install You can install the Kubernetes integration for Windows using Helm. See an example on how to install the integration in a cluster with nodes having different build versions of Windows (1809 and 2004): Install kube-state-metrics and run it in your cluster using this snippet: curl -L -o kube-state-metrics-1.9.5.zip https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/archive/v1.9.5.zip && unzip kube-state-metrics-1.9.5.zip && kubectl apply -f kube-state-metrics-1.9.5/examples/standard Copy Create a values.yml file with the follow data to be used by Helm: global: licenseKey: <YOUR_LICENSE_KEY> cluster: <YOUR_CLUSTER_NAME> enableLinux: false enableWindows: true windowsOsList: - version: 1809 imageTag: 2.2.0-windows-1809-alpha buildNumber: 10.0.17763 - version: 2004 imageTag: 2.2.0-windows-2004-alpha buildNumber: 10.0.19041 Copy Install the integration with: helm install <YOUR_INSTALL_NAME> newrelic/newrelic-infrastructure -f values.yml Copy Confirm that the DaemonSet has been created successfully by looking for newrelic-infra in the results generated by this command: kubectl get daemonsets Copy The Helm chart will create one DeamonSet per each version of Windows that is in the list and use NodeSelector to deploy the corresponding Pod per Node. Limitations The following limitations apply to the Kubernetes integration for Windows: The Windows agent only sends the Kubernetes samples (K8sNodeSample, K8sPodSample, etc.) SystemSample, StorageSample, NetworkSample, and ProcessSample are not generated. Some Kubernetes metrics are missing because the Windows kubelet doesn’t have them: Node: fsInodes: not sent fsInodesFree: not sent fsInodesUsed: not sent memoryMajorPageFaultsPerSecond: always returns zero as a value memoryPageFaults: always returns zero as a value memoryRssBytes: always returns zero as a value runtimeInodes: not sent runtimeInodesFree: not sent runtimeInodesUsed: not sent Pod: net.errorsPerSecond: not sent net.rxBytesPerSecond: not sent net.txBytesPerSecond: not sent Container: containerID: not sent containerImageID: not sent memoryUsedBytes: in the UI, this is displayed in the pod card that appears when you click on a pod, and will show no data. We will soon fix this by updating our charts to use memoryWorkingSetBytes instead. Volume: fsUsedBytes: zero, so fsUsedPercent is zero Known issues with the Windows Kubelet There are a couple of issues with the Windows version of Kubelet that can prevent the integration from fetching data: Issue 90554: This issue makes the Kubelet return 500 errors when the integration makes a request to the /stats/summary endpoint. It will be included in the Kubernetes 1.19 release and has been backported to the releases 1.16.11, 1.17.7, and 1.18.4. There is no solution on the integration side for this problem, we advise you to update to one of the patch versions as soon as possible. You can see if you're being affected by this problem by enabling verbose logs and looking for messages of the type: error querying Kubelet. Get \"https://<KUBELET_IP>/stats/summary\": error calling kubelet endpoint. Got status code: 500 Copy Issue 87730: This issue makes the Kubelet metrics very slow when running minimal load. It makes the integration fail with a timeout error. A patch for this issue has been added for Kubernetes 1.18 and backported to 1.15.12, 1.16.9, and 1.17.5. We advise you to update to one of the patch versions as soon as possible. To mitigate this issue you can increase the integration timeout with the TIMEOUT config option. You can see if you're being affected by this problem by enabling verbose logs and looking for messages of the type: error querying Kubelet.
