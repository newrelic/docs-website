NrAiSignal shows details from every NRQL alert condition and every signal on your account, for every aggregation window that passes. This data is posted immediately after each aggregation window is aggregated and evaluated, so it will show you exactly what [our alerts](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/get-started/alerts-ai-overview-page) are seeing.
