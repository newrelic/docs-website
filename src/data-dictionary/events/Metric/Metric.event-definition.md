Represents a metric data point (a measurement over a range of time, or a sample at a specific point in time) with multiple attributes attached, which allow for in-depth analysis and querying. This metric data comes from our Metric API, our Telemetry SDKs, network performance monitoring, and some of our open-source exporters/integrations.
