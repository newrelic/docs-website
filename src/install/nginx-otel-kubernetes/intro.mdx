Monitor your NGINX servers using the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib) to send metrics and telemetry data to New Relic.
This integration leverages the OpenTelemetry [nginxreceiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/nginxreceiver), [receivercreator](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/receivercreator) to monitor your NGINX performance metrics, connection statistics, and server health.
