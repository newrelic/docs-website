1. Change directory to the integrations configuration folder by running:

    ```shell
    cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d
    ```

2. Copy the sample configuration file by running:

    ```shell
    sudo cp mssql-config.yml.sample mssql-config.yml
    ```

3. Edit the `mssql-config.yml` file. This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost. It uses default connection on `port 1433`:

    ```yml
    integrations:
        - name: nri-mssql
          env:
            HOSTNAME: localhost
            PORT: 1433
            USERNAME: mssql_user
            PASSWORD: mssql_password
            interval: 15s
          labels:
            environment: production
          inventory_source: config/mssql

    ```

You can find all the config options along with more complex config examples [at the bottom of this doc](#sample-configuration-files).
