1. Change directory to the integrations configuration folder by running:

   ```shell
   cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d
   ```

2. Copy the sample configuration file by running:

   ```shell
   sudo cp mssql-config.yml.sample mssql-config.yml
   ```

3. Edit the `mssql-config.yml` file. This is the basic configuration used to collect metrics and inventory from your localhost. It uses default connection on `port 1433`:

   ```yml
   integrations:
     - name: nri-mssql
       env:
         HOSTNAME: localhost
         PORT: 1433
         USERNAME: mssql_user
         PASSWORD: mssql_password
       interval: 15s
       labels:
         environment: production
       inventory_source: config/mssql
   ```

You can find all the config options at the bottom of this doc along with more complex config examples.
