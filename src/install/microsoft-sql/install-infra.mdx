headingText: Install the infrastructure agent
---

To use the Microsoft SQL Server integration, first [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-monitoring/get-started/choose-infra-install-method) on your SQL Server host, or on a host with remote access to it. The infrastructure agent monitors the host itself, while the integration you'll install in the next step extends your monitoring with Microsoft SQL Server-specific data.

<Callout variant="important">
    For SQL Server access using a gMSA, configure the infrastructure agent to run as the gMSA.
</Callout>
