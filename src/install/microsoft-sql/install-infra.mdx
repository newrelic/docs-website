headingText: Install the infrastructure agent
---

To use the Microsoft SQL Server integration, you need to first [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-monitoring/get-started/choose-infra-install-method) on a Windows host, or on a host capable of remotely accessing Microsoft SQL Server. The infrastructure agent monitors the host itself, while the integration you'll install in the next step extends your monitoring with Microsoft SQL Server-specific data.

<Callout variant="important">
    For SQL Server access using a gMSA, configure the infrastructure agent to run as the gMSA.
</Callout>
