The guided install is the easiest and simplest way to install the Microsoft SQL integration while providing maximum control. It also offers a quickstart option that includes optional pre-built resources, such as dashboards and alerts, alongside the Microsoft SQL integration, so you can gain instant visibility into your database.

If you're in the EU, click 'EU guided install.' Otherwise, click 'Guided install' to begin.
