Our HAProxy integration collects and sends inventory and metrics from your HAProxy instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics for the HAProxy server, frontends, and backends.

To get the most out of this page, select the installation method that fits your environment. You need a [New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup) before starting the installation process.
