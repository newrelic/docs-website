Monitor your NGINX Plus servers using the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib) to send metrics and telemetry data to New Relic.
This integration leverages the OpenTelemetry [prometheusreceiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/prometheusreceiver) and [nginx-prometheus-exporter](https://github.com/nginx/nginx-prometheus-exporter) to monitor your NGINX Plus performance metrics, connection statistics, and server health.
