The New Relic log management solution provides deeper visibility into application and infrastructure performance data, including events, errors, and traces. You can reduce Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) and facilitate quick troubleshooting of production incidents. By forwarding AWS logs to New Relic, you can achieve comprehensive visibility into system performance, identify issues before they escalate, and make data-driven decisions efficiently. It helps enhance your team's operational efficiency while maintaining security and compliance.
