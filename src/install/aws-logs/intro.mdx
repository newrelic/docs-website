New Relic supports forwarding logs from AWS services. Our log management solution provides deeper visibility into application and infrastructure performance data (events, errors, traces, and more) to reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR) and quickly troubleshoot production incidents.
Discover how you can amplify the power of your AWS logs by forwarding them to New Relic. Gain unparalleled visibility into your system's performance, catch issues before they become problems, and make data-driven decisions with ease. Enhance your team's operational efficiency while maintaining security and compliance.
