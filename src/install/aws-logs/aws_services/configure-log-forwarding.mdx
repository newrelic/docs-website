There are multiple ways to send logs from your AWS services to New Relic. Choose the path that best suits your needs. Both the integration instructions and the CloudFormation stack will adapt to your selections.

### Select AWS sink(s) [#select-aws-sinks]

Most AWS service logs are generated in S3 buckets or CloudWatch log groups. Select one or both AWS sinks.

### Select log integration path(s) [#select-log-integration-paths]

Consider using the <DNT>**Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose**</DNT> for direct and high-volume data streaming, and the <DNT>**New Relic Lambda Function**</DNT> forwarder if you need high control over data transformation before forwarding logs.

### Set up triggers(s) [#set-up-triggers]
Setting up triggers ensures that new logs are sent to New Relic every time an AWS service logs to an S3 bucket or a CloudWatch log group. With a single CloudFormation stack, you can configure up to 40 triggers (S3 buckets and/or CloudWatch log groups).

* For AWS service logs stored in S3 buckets, specify the **S3 bucket name** and **Prefix** (optional).
* For AWS service logs stored in CloudWatch log groups, specify the **Log Group** name and **Filter** (optional).

### Select New Relic logs API endpoint [#select-api-endpoint]
The system automatically sets the endpoint based on the region of your New Relic account.
* For US account, logs are sent to `https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1`
* For UE account, logs are sent to `https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1`

### Add custom attributes [#add-custom-attributes]
Add custom attributes to organize your logs and make it easier to search, filter, analyze, and parse.
