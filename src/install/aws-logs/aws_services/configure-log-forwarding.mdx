In the <DNT>**Configuration logs**</DNT> page, choose a path for sending logs, set up integration for AWS sinks, verify the log endpoint, and add custom attributes to organize your logs.

<Steps>
<Step>
### Choose your log forwarding path [#choose-log-forwarding-path]
Following are the paths to forward AWS service logs to New Relic, suited to different needs.
* <DNT>**Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose**</DNT>: Ideal for direct and high-volume data streaming.
* <DNT>**New Relic Lambda Function**</DNT>: Provides high control over data transformation before forwarding.
Depending upon your needs, choose any of the following log interation path:
   * <DNT>**S3 via Lambda**</DNT>
   * <DNT>**CloudWatch via Firehose or Lambda > CloudWatch via Firehose**</DNT>
   * <DNT>**CloudWatch via Firehose or Lambda > CloudWatch via Lambda**</DNT>
You can select both <DNT>**S3 via Lambda**</DNT>, and any one CloudWatch integration method together.
</Step>
<Step>
### Choose AWS sink [#choose-aws-sink]
You can use a CloudFormation template to set up log forwarding to New Relic for up to 40 buckets and/or log groups.
1. To send AWS service logs stored in S3 buckets using the New Relic Lambda function, enter the following details:
   * **S3 bucket name**: S3 source bucket names
   * **Prefix** (Optional) : Specify a source prefix within the S3 buckets
2. To send AWS service logs from CloudWatch Log groups using the New Relic Lambda function or Firehose, enter the following details:
   * Log Group: Source CloudWatch Log group names
   * Filter (Optional): Specify a filter to refine logs within the CloudWatch Logs
</Step>
<Step>
### Set API endpoint for logs [#choose-api-endpoint]
The system sets the endpoint by default based on the region of your New Relic account.
* US account: `https://log-api.newrelic.com/log/v1`
* EU account: `https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1`
</Step>
<Step>
### Add custom attributes [#add-custom-attributes]
Add custom attributes to organize your logs and make it easier to search, filter, analyze, and parse. After adding custom configurations, select <DNT>**Continue**</DNT>.
