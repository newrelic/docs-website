After the new stack is created, it forwards your collected logs to New Relic One. To see your data:

* Navigate to the [logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher).
* OR, navigate to the [New query explorer](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data) to query your data.

For logs forwarded via the New Relic Lambda forwarder:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Log WHERE instrumentation.provider = 'aws' AND instrumentation.name = 'lambda'
   ```

For logs forwarded via the Kinesis Data Firehose integration:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM Log WHERE instrumentation.provider = 'aws' AND instrumentation.name = 'firehose'
   ```

If no data appears after you enable the log management capabilities, or the custom attributes are not appearing in the log, refer to the following troubleshooing procedures:
* [Logs not appearing from CloudWatch via Firehose](/docs/logs/troubleshooting/aws-log-integration-issues/logs-not-appearing-from-cloudwatch-firehose)
* [Logs not appearing from CloudWatch via Lambda](/docs/logs/troubleshooting/aws-log-integration-issues/logs-not-appearing-from-cloudwatch-lambda)
* [Logs not appearing from S3 via Lambda](/docs/logs/troubleshooting/aws-log-integration-issues/logs-not-appearing-from-s3-lambda)
* [Custom attributes not appearing in logs](/docs/logs/troubleshooting/aws-log-integration-issues/custom-attributes-not-appearing)
* [Failing to delete a Stack](/docs/logs/troubleshooting/aws-log-integration-issues/stack-deletion-fails)
* [Log forwarding restrictions](/docs/logs/troubleshooting/aws-log-integration-issues/log-forwarding-restrictions)

  When configuring your CloudFormation integration, it's important to understand how triggers and filters are managed. For guidance on handling S3 triggers and CloudWatch filters, refer to [Manage triggers and filters with CloudFormation](/docs/logs/forward-logs/manage-triggers-and-filters-with-cloudformation).
