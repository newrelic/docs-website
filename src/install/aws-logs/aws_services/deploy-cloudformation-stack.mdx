After you customize the CloudFormation stack parameters to meet your requirements, click <DNT>**Create stack**</DNT>.
Creating the stack's resources may take several minutes and may generate multiple stacks, depending on how you configure log and metric forwarding. With a single deployment command, you can create a new stack to forward logs from multiple AWS resources.
If stack creation fails, refer to the [troubleshooting procedure](/docs/logs/troubleshooting/aws-log-integration-issues/stack-creation-fails).
