headingText: 'Optional: Configure retries'

You can configure the number of retries you want to perform in case the function fails to send the data in case of communication issues. The recommended number is three retries, but you can change the retry behavior by changing the below parameters:

```
MAX_RETRIES = 3  # Defines the number of retries after lambda failure to deliver data
INITIAL_BACKOFF = 1  # Defines the initial wait seconds until next retry is executed
BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER = 2  # Time multiplier between the retries
```

As an example, in default above configuration, first retry will happen after 1 second, second retry after 2 seconds and third retry will happen after 4 seconds.

<Callout variant="tip">
  The more the number of retries there are can make the function run for longer times. This increases the probability of having higher costs for Lambda. However, decreasing the number of retries could increase the probability of data loss.
