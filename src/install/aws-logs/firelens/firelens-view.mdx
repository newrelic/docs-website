## View log data [#find-data]

If everything is configured correctly and your data is being collected, you should see log data in both of these places:

* Our [logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher)
* Our tools for running [NRQL queries](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data). For example, you can execute a query like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Log
```

If no data appears after you enable our log management capabilities, follow our [standard log troubleshooting procedures](/docs/logs/log-management/troubleshooting/no-log-data-appears-ui/).

### Disable log forwarding [#disable]

To disable log forwarding capabilities, follow standard procedures in [AWS Firelens documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/using_firelens.html). You do not need to do anything else in New Relic.
