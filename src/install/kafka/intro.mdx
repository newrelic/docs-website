The New Relic Kafka [on-host integration](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations) reports metrics and configuration data from your Kafka service. We instrument all the key elements of your cluster, including brokers (both ZooKeeper and Bootstrap), producers, consumers, and topics.

Gain deep insights into Kafka performance with seamless data integration into New Relic. Monitor key metrics for clusters, producers, consumers, and topics effortlessly, all within our powerful platform. Create alerts to stay ahead of spikes, build custom dashboards for tailored views, and proactively optimize your Kafka monitoring.
