headingText: Install the infrastructure agent

To use the Kafka integration, you need to [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic/) on the same host. The infrastructure agent monitors the host. The integration you'll install adds Kafka-specific data. This data includes metrics for the database and instance metrics.
