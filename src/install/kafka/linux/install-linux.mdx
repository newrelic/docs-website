headingText: Configure the Kafka integration

1. Change your directory to the integrations configuration folder. Run this command:

    ```shell
    cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d
    ```

2. Copy the sample configuration file. Run this command:

    ```shell
    sudo cp nri-kafka-config.yml.sample kafka-config.yml
    ```

3. Edit the `kafka-config.yml` file. The following example collects metrics and inventory discovered from two JMX hosts.

    ```yml
    integrations:
      - name: nri-kafka
        env:
          CLUSTER_NAME: testcluster1
          KAFKA_VERSION: "1.0.0"
          AUTODISCOVER_STRATEGY: zookeeper
          ZOOKEEPER_HOSTS: '[{"host": "localhost", "port": 2181}, {"host": "localhost2", "port": 2181}]'
          ZOOKEEPER_PATH: "/kafka-root"
          DEFAULT_JMX_USER: username
          DEFAULT_JMX_PASSWORD: password
          TOPIC_MODE: all
        interval: 15s
        labels:
          env: production
          role: kafka
        inventory_source: config/kafka
    ```

You can set the values for these settings in several ways:

* Adding the value directly in the config file. This is the most common way.

* Replacing the values from environment variables using the `{{ }}` notation. Read more about [using environment variable passthroughs with on-host integrations](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent/#passthrough) or see the example for [environment variables replacement](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/host-integrations-list/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-integration#envvar-replacement).

* Using secrets management. Use this to protect sensitive information, such as passwords that would be exposed in plain text on the configuration file. For more information, see [secrets management](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/secrets-management).

The config file will likely require fine-tuning based on your specific Kafka instance. For example, you may want to use SSL or TLS to authenticate. You can find all the config options at the bottom of this doc alongside more complex config examples.
