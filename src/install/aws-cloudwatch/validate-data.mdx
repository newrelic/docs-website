To confirm you're receiving data from the Metric Streams, follow these steps:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities > Infrastructure > AWS](https://one.newrelic.com/infra/infrastructure/cloud-aws)**</DNT>. Search for the AWS account you've connected to New Relic. <DNT>**Stream**</DNT> accounts.
2. Check the account status dashboard and confirm that New Relic receives the metric data. This may include errors and number of namespaces and metrics ingested.
3. Explore your data by writing queries for specififc sets of metrics.

It may take few minutes for New Relic to detect new resources and synthesize them as entities. 

<Callout variant="tip">
  AWS CloudWatch metrics for global services, such AWS Billing, are only availble in the <DNT>**us-east-1**</DNT> region. Make sure there's an active CloudWatch metric stream configured in that region.
