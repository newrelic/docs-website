headingText: Set minimum permissions
---

Before you integrate, you need to set certain permissions so New Relic can access your AWS data. At minimum, you need to create a `ReadOnlyAccess` policy and apply these minimum permissions to the AWS roles associated with New Relic:

    ```json
    config:BatchGetResourceConfig
    config:ListDiscoveredResources
    elasticache:DescribeCacheClusters
    tag:GetResources
    ```

Depending on your set up, your configuration requirements may vary:

    * For users who manage multiple AWS accounts, [connect each account to a single New Relic account](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/manage-aws-data/aws-multi-account).
    * For users who manage multiple regions within those accounts, you need to create a separate Kinesis Data Firehose that points to New Relic for each region.
