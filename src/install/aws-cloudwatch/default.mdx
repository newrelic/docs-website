headingText: Integrate CloudWatch Metric Streams
---

Once your permissions are set, you can set up the CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. We have a few different methods depending on your preference:

* You can follow our in-app guided install, which directs you to the New Relic platform where you'll create CloudFormation template for CloudWatch Metric Streams. 
* You can follow some procedures that use AWS Console to create resources yourself.
* If you're currently using API polling, this doc helps you migrate to CloudWatch Metric Streams.
