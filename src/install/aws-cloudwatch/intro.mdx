Amazon CloudWatch Metric Streams is an AWS service that creates a real-time stream of metrics to a destination of your choice. To stream your AWS data to New Relic, you can create a custom Firehose that forwards AWS metrics to our CloudWatch Metric Streams integration. This lets you view your AWS data in the New Relic platform.
