Now that you can view your AWS data, we recommend that you:

* Check out [how to create alerts, use tags, and manage your AWS data](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/manage-aws-data/aws-integrations-metrics).
* Learn how to monitor your [EC2 instances](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/ec2-quickstart) or your [EKS cluster](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/eks-add-on).
* Review the [mechanics of querying with NRQL](/docs/nrql/get-started/introduction-nrql-how-nrql-works) to get the most out of your data.
