Enable or disable ASP.NET compatibility mode in your WCF application depending on which type of events you want monitored:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="mode-enabled"
    title="ASP.NET pipeline events and WCF events"
  >
    When ASP.NET compatibility mode is <DNT>**enabled**</DNT>, the .NET agent instruments ASP.NET pipeline events as well as WCF events. In this mode, the agent provides you with a full view of your application stack.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="mode-disabled"
    title="Only WCF events"
  >
    When ASP.NET compatibility mode is <DNT>**disabled**</DNT>, the .NET agent only instruments WCF events. Any activity that occurs as part of the ASP.NET pipeline will not be captured, such as agent API calls that are made outside of a WCF transaction.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

If your application is receiving traffic, data should appear within a few minutes. If it doesn't, see [No data appears](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-net).
