<Callout variant="important">
  Before installing the NuGet package into a multi-project Visual Studio solution, make sure you have selected the correct project for your New Relic .NET application (for example, a specific website project).
</Callout>

If service files are nested within a solution folder, the NuGet installer can't locate or update the necessary files. This will cause issues with the .NET agent setup and will prevent the agent from reporting metrics on your Cloud Service.

We recommend you place the `Web` or `Worker` role at the <DNT>root</DNT> of the solution before installing the NuGet package. Once you install the New Relic .NET agent, you can move the Cloud role back into the solution folder.
