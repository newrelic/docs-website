These install details are the same for all installations using a package manager:

* For security purposes, ensure the location where you install the agent is configured to prevent unauthorized access.
* Install location:
  * For agent versions 10.0.0 or higher: `/usr/local/newrelic-dotnet-agent`.
  * For agent versions 9.9.0 or lower: `/usr/local/newrelic-netcore20-agent`.
    <Callout variant="important">
      This doc will use the newer name where applicable; if you're using an older agent, you'll need to replace that name.
    </Callout>
* The file `newrelic-dotnet-agent-path.sh` is placed in `/etc/profile.d`, and this will set the `CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME` environment variable on system start.
* The path to `newrelic.config` file is `${CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME}/newrelic.config`.
