Both New Relic's .NET agent and Microsoft Application Insights rely on the CLR Profiler, but only one may be active at a time. You must disable Application Insights in order for the .NET agent to function properly. For more information, see our [Application Insights troubleshooting procedures](/docs/agents/net-agent/azure-troubleshooting/net-profiler-conflict-microsoft-application-insights).
