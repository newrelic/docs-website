<Callout variant="important">
  The NuGet packages in this procedure support only the old `packages.config`. They do not support the new `PackageReference` format. For more information see [Microsoft's package reference documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files)

For multi-project solutions, make sure you've selected the correct project (for example, a specific website project) before installing the NuGet package.

1. Open your Visual Studio solution, or create a new one by selecting <DNT>**File > New > Project**</DNT>. For multi-project solutions, make sure you have selected the correct project (for example, a specific website project).
2. If you do not already have an Azure Cloud Service project in your solution, add one by right-clicking your app in the <DNT>**Solution Explorer**</DNT> and selecting <DNT>**Add Windows Azure Cloud Service Project**</DNT>.
3. Open the <DNT>**Package Manager**</DNT> console by selecting <DNT>**Tools > Library Package Manager > Package Manager Console**</DNT>. Set your project as the default project.
4. From the <DNT>**Package Manager**</DNT> command prompt, type `Install-Package NewRelicWindowsAzure` and press <DNT>**Enter**</DNT>.
5. Follow the prompts to enter your [New Relic license key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-license-key) and your [application name](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/name-your-net-application) as you want it to appear in the New Relic UI. Or, use your solution name as the default app name.
6. From the <DNT>**Solution Explorer**</DNT>, right-click your Azure Cloud Service project, and select <DNT>**Publish**</DNT>.
7. If this is your first time deploying this app to Azure, enter your Azure credentials.
