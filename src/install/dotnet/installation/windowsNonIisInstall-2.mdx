1. Run the install wizard. Some tips for using the install wizard:
   * You'll need your [New Relic license key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-license-key).
   * If you're updating an existing installation using the install wizard, select the **Change** option.
   * **Optional**: you can also run the installer via the command line or from a script. For how to do that, see the advanced install details below.
2. For each application you wish to monitor, give it a meaningful name. For tips on that, see [Name your app](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-and-configuration/naming-your-net-application).
3. If your application is short-lived and exists for less than 60 seconds, it requires [configuration](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/monitor-short-lived-net-processes) or it won't report data.
4. Restart affected applications.

Instead of using the MSI install wizard, described above, you can run the MSI from the command line or from a script. This can be useful for automating your agent install.

Here's an example command for performing a new agent install using the MSI installer. (For changes to an existing installation, use the `ADDLOCAL` command, explained below.) Replace the values with values relevant to your install.

```bash
msiexec.exe /i C:\PATH_TO\newrelic-agent-win-x86-VERSION.msi /qb NR_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY INSTALLLEVEL=1
```

The `INSTALLLEVEL` can be either `1` or `50`:

* `1`: Installs .NET agent with default options (described in table below). If your application is not hosted on IIS or uses IIS as a reverse proxy, you should use option `50`.
* `50`: Installs the agent with InstrumentAllNETFramework enabled (described below).

Instead of using the `INSTALLLEVEL` presets, you can customize which features to install with the `ADDLOCAL` command shown below. This is also the command you'd use to update an existing installation. Here's an example command:

```bash
msiexec.exe /i C:\PATH_TO\newrelic-agent-win-x86-VERSION.msi /qb NR_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY ADDLOCAL=OPTION_1, OPTION_2
```

Available options are:

        `NETFrameworkSupport`
      </td>

      <td>
        Enabled by default. This identifies the registry keys used to attach the .NET profiler to a .NET Framework application. Without this, our .NET agent won't work for an IIS-hosted .NET Framework app.
      </td>

    <tr>

        `NETCoreSupport`
      </td>

      <td>
        Enabled by default. This identifies the registry keys used to attach the .NET profiler to a .NET Core application. Without this, the .NET agent will not work for an IIS-hosted .NET Core app.

    <tr>
      <td>
        `InstrumentAllNETFramework`
      </td>

      <td>
        This will result in all .NET Framework applications being instrumented by setting global environment variables. This setting is the equivalent of selecting **Instrument all** in the MSI install wizard.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `StartMenuShortcuts`
      </td>

      <td>
        Enabled by default. Adds several useful shortcuts to your start menu.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `ASPNETTools`
      </td>

      <td>
        Enabled by default. Adds the ASP.NET cache flush tool which, when run, clears out some .NET temporary files and restarts IIS.
