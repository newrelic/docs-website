Your application must receive traffic in order for you to view its performance in New Relic. You may need to wait a few minutes for data to start appearing. If no data appears, see the [troubleshooting procedures](/docs/agents/net-agent/azure-troubleshooting/azure-web-apps-using-always-on-and-no-data-appears) for Azure Web Apps. To view your app's performance in New Relic: Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services > (select an app)**</DNT>. The [APM <DNT>**Summary**</DNT> page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page) automatically appears.

If no data appears after installing the agent, generating traffic for your app, and waiting a few minutes, try these troubleshooting tips:

* Make sure that all files in the `newrelic` directory at the root of your app got published to Azure.
* Make sure the environment variables are set correctly.
* Make sure Microsoft Application Insights is **not** installed and configured on the application. For more information, see the [Application Insights troubleshooting procedures](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/azure-troubleshooting/no-data-reporting-microsoft-application-insights/).
* Refer to additional [Azure troubleshooting procedures](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/azure-troubleshooting/azure-web-apps-unable-open-log-file) as applicable.
