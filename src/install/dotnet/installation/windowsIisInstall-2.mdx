1. Run the install wizard. Some tips for using the install wizard:
   * You'll need your [New Relic license key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-license-key).
   * For IIS only: If you'll be monitoring only apps hosted on IIS, leave **Instrument all** unselected. 
   * If you're updating an existing installation using the install wizard, select the **Change** option.
   * **Optional**: you can also run the installer via the command line or from a script. For how to do that, see the advanced install details below.
2. For each application you wish to monitor, give it a meaningful name. For tips on that, see [Name your app](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-and-configuration/naming-your-net-application).
3. If your application is short-lived and exists for less than 60 seconds, it requires [configuration](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/monitor-short-lived-net-processes) or it won't report data.
4. Restart affected applications. If using IIS, restart that.

Instead of using the MSI install wizard, described above, you can run the MSI from the command line or from a script. This can be useful for automating your agent install.

Here's the command to perform a new agent install using the MSI installer. (For changes to an existing installation, use the `ADDLOCAL` command, explained below.) Replace the values with values relevant to your install. 

```bash
msiexec.exe /i C:\PATH_TO\newrelic-agent-win-x86-VERSION.msi /qb NR_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY INSTALLLEVEL=1
```

The `INSTALLLEVEL` can be either `1` or `50`:

* `1`: Installs .NET agent with default options (described in table below). If your application is not hosted on IIS or uses IIS as a reverse proxy, you should use option `50`.
* `50`: Installs the agent with InstrumentAllNETFramework enabled (described below).

Instead of using the `INSTALLLEVEL` presets, you can customize which features to install with the `ADDLOCAL` command shown below. This is also the command you'd use to update an existing installation.

Here's an example. Replace the values with values relevant to your install. 

```bash
msiexec.exe /i C:\PATH_TO\newrelic-agent-win-x86-VERSION.msi /qb NR_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY ADDLOCAL=OPTION_1, OPTION_2
```

Available options are:

    <tr>

        `NETFrameworkSupport`
      </td>

      <td>
        Enabled by default. This identifies the registry keys used to attach the .NET profiler to a .NET Framework application. Without this, our .NET agent won't work for an IIS-hosted .NET Framework app.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `NETCoreSupport`
      </td>

      <td>
        Enabled by default. This identifies the registry keys used to attach the .NET profiler to a .NET Core application. Without this, the .NET agent will not work for an IIS-hosted .NET Core app.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `InstrumentAllNETFramework`
      </td>

      <td>
        This will result in all .NET Framework applications being instrumented by setting global environment variables. This setting is the equivalent of selecting **Instrument all** in the MSI install wizard.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `StartMenuShortcuts`
      </td>

      <td>
        Enabled by default. Adds several useful shortcuts to your start menu.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `ASPNETTools`
      </td>

      <td>
        Enabled by default. Adds the ASP.NET cache flush tool which, when run, clears out some .NET temporary files and restarts IIS.
