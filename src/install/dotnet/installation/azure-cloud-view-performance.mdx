Your application must receive traffic in order for you to view its performance in New Relic. You may need to wait a few minutes for data to start appearing. If no data appears, see the [troubleshooting procedures](/docs/agents/net-agent/azure-troubleshooting/azure-cloud-services-no-data-appears) for Azure Cloud Services. To view your app's performance in APM: Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services > (select an app)**</DNT>. The [APM <DNT>**Summary**</DNT> page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page) automatically appears.
