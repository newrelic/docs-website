Our Apache integration reports data from your Apache web server to the New Relic platform. You can view dashboards of your Apache metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts.

To get the most out of this page, select the installation method that fits your environment. You need a [New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup) before starting the installation process.

  The guided install is a single CLI command you can run to monitor your  instance. It's a good option for small organizations, or for anyone who wants to test out New Relic.

  For a more permanent and scalable solution, we recommend the standard manual install of the agent: keep reading for how to do that.
