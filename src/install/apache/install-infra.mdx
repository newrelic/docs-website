headingText: Install the infrastructure agent

To use the Apache integration, you need our infrastructure agent on the same host. The infrastructure agent monitors the host itself, while the Apache integration extends monitoring to your Apache instance.

If you haven't already installed the infrastructure agent:

1. Open the [infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic/) instructions in a new tab and complete that installation.
2. After you've installed in the infrastructure agent, return to this tab and complete the remaining steps to install and configure the Apache integration.
