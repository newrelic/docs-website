<Callout variant="tip">
  Complete these steps on the mongos to be monitored. If you want to collect mongod-level metrics,
  such as host or replica set statistics, create the role
  and user on each mongod as well.
</Callout>

1. In the MongoDB shell. switch to the admin database:

   ```shell
   use admin
   ```

2. Create a new user, and assign `clusterMonitor` and `readAnyDatabase` roles to the user (adjust the `username` and `password` as required).

   ```js
   db.createUser({
     user: "username",
     pwd:  "password",
     roles: [ 
       { role: "clusterMonitor", db: "admin" },
       { role: "readAnyDatabase", db: "admin" }
     ]
   })
   ```

For more information, check the [MongoDB Atlas documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.createUser/index.html).
