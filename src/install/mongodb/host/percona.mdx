<Callout variant="tip">
  Complete these steps on the mongos you want to monitor. If you want to collect mongod-level metrics, such as `host` or `replicaset` statistics, create the role and user on each MongoDB as well.
</Callout>

1. Run this command to switch to the admin database:

    ```shell
    use admin
    ```

2. Create a new user and assign `clusterMonitor` and `readAnyDatabase` roles to the created user (adjust the `username` and `password` as required).

    ```js
    db.createUser({
      user: "username",
      pwd:  "password",
      roles: [ 
        { role: "clusterMonitor", db: "admin" },
        { role: "readAnyDatabase", db: "admin" }
      ]
    })
    ```

For more information, check the [MongoDB Atlas](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.createUser/index.html) documentation.
