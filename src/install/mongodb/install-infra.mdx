headingText: Install the infrastructure agent
---

To use the MongoDB integration, you need to also [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic/) on the same host. The infrastructure agent monitors the host itself, while the integration you'll install in the next step extends your monitoring with MongoDB-specific data such as database and instance metrics.
