To use the MongoDB integration, you need to also [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic/) on the same host. . The integration you'll install adds MongoDB-specific data. This data includes metrics for the database and instance metrics.
