Our Memcached [integration](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations) collects and sends inventory and metrics from your Memcached instance. Once instrumented, you can use New Relic to aggregate and visualize key performance metrics at the instance and slab levels.

To get the most out of this page, select the installation method that fits your environment. You need a [New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup) before starting the installation process.

  **Use guided install to quickly see your data in the UI**

  The guided install is a single CLI command you can run to monitor your Memcached instance. It's a good option for small organizations, or for anyone who wants to test out New Relic.

  For a more permanent and scalable solution, we recommend the standard manual install of the agent: keep reading for how to do that.
