headingText: Configure the Memcached integration 
---

Edit the `memcached-config.yml` file to configure your integration as needed. The following example config fills in all the required options and reports all metrics the integration pulls:

```yml
integrations:
  - name: nri-memcached
    env:
      PORT: "11211"
      HOST: memcached_host

      # ifauthentication is enabled.
      USERNAME: cacheuser
      PASSWORD: password
    interval: 15s
    inventory_source: config/memcached
```
