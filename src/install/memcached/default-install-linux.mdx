1. Change directory to the integrations configuration folder by running:

   ```shell
   cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d
   ```

2. Copy the sample configuration file by running:

   ```shell
   sudo cp memcached-config.yml.sample memcached-config.yml
   ```

3. Edit the `memcached-config.yml` with your info. Here's a basic configuration example:

   ```yml
   integrations:
     - name: nri-memcached
       env:
         PORT: "11211"
         HOST: memcached_host

         # ifauthentication is enabled.
         USERNAME: cacheuser
         PASSWORD: password
       interval: 15s
       inventory_source: config/memcached
   ```

You can find all the config options at the bottom of this doc along with more complex config examples.
