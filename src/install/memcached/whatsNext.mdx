## Memcached instance settings [#instance-settings]

The Memcached integration collects both Metrics(<strong>M</strong>) and Inventory(<strong>I</strong>) information. Check the <DNT>**Applies To**</DNT> column to find which settings can be used for each collection:

The values for these settings can be defined in several ways:

* Add the value directly in the config file.
* Replace the values from environment variables using the `{{}}` notation. This requires infrastructure agent version 1.14.0 or higher. Read more [here](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/configuration/configure-infrastructure-agent/#passthrough) or see example [below](#example4).
* Use secrets management to protect sensitive information, such as passwords, from being exposed in plain text in the configuration file. For more information, see how to use [secrets management](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/secrets-management).

## Inventory data [#inventory]

The Memcached integration captures the configuration parameters of the memcached instance. The data is available on the [Inventory page](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-inventory-page-search-your-entire-infrastructure), under the <DNT>**config/memcached**</DNT> source. For more about inventory data, see [Understand integration data](/docs/infrastructure/integrations-getting-started/getting-started/understand-integration-data-data-types#inventory-data).

The integration captures data for the following Memcached configuration parameters:
