When you [install AI monitoring](/docs/ai-monitoring/intro-to-ai-monitoring), you're allowing our APM agents to collect metrics and event data from AI libraries and frameworks. To get started, you'll instrument your AI-powered app with an APM agent, then update configurations to adjust the agent's behavior.
