When you [install AI monitoring](/docs/ai-monitoring/intro-to-ai-monitoring), you're allowing our APM agents to collect metrics and event data from AI libraries and frameworks. To get started, you'll instrument your AI-powered app with an APM agent, then update configurations to adjust the agent's behavior.

  When enabled, AI monitoring  records a streaming copy of inputs and outputs sent to and from the models you choose to monitor, including any personal information contained therein. 
  You're responsible for obtaining consent from your model users that their interactions may be recorded by a third party (New Relic) for the purpose of providing the AI monitoring feature.
