headingText: Pass in some basic configurations
componentType: default

The Python agent needs some basic configurations to get started. Here are two common ways to set these:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="config-file-option"
    title="Use a configuration file"
  >
    You can use the configuration file to set a variety of parameters, but we recommend that you start by setting your license key and app name.
    
    To create a configuration file:

    1. Go to a working directory where you can store the file, and run the following:

    ```
    newrelic-admin generate-config YOUR_LICENSE_KEY newrelic.ini
    ```

    2. Edit your `newrelic.ini` and insert values for the following:

        ```
        ...
        license_key = INSERT_YOUR_LICENSE_KEY
        ...
        app_name = INSERT_YOUR_APP_NAME
        ...
        ```
    3. Remember where this file is located because you'll use it later in the setup.

    </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="env-variables"
    title="Use environment variables"
  >
    If you don't use a configuration file, you can use environment variables to set configuration values. While you can create a variety of configurations with environment variables, we recommend you start by setting your license key and app name:

    ```
    export NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=INSERT_YOUR_LICENSE_KEY
    export NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME=INSERT_YOUR_APP_NAME
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>
