You can use the Python agent with AJP in conjunction with [flup](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flup).

To integrate the Python agent with your app, run the newrelic-admin script in front of your usual app startup command. The admin script was included when you downloaded the Python agent, and you can use a command like this:

```
NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program YOUR_COMMAND_OPTIONS
```

  If you have difficulty with this automatic initialization, you can also try our manual instrumentation steps. To get those instructions, go back to the framework question and select **Unsupported WSGI framework**.
