To integrate the Python agent with your app, you can run the newrelic-admin script in front of your usual app startup command. The admin script was included when you downloaded the Python agent.

The Python agent provides support for the [Waitress](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/waitress) WSGI server. This includes automatically instrumenting the WSGI application entry point supplied to the Waitress server. The automatic instrumentation will work if the `waitress.serve()` API function is used directly, or if `egg:waitress#main` is specified as the server to use when starting up the web application using PasteDeploy.

### Admin script integration method (recommended) [#integrated-server]

You can use the recommended admin script integration method with a command like this:

```
NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program YOUR_COMMAND_OPTIONS
```

### Admin script with PasteDeploy [#paste]

Instead of manually integrating the call to startup the Waitress WSGI server in your application code, you might be using PasteDeploy with a configuration file like the following:

```
[server:main]
use = egg:waitress#main
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 8080
```

When you start up your WSGI application, wrap the running of the `paster` command:

```
NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program paster serve production.ini
```

  If you have difficulty with this automatic initialization, you can also try our manual instrumentation steps. To get those instructions, go back to the framework question and select **Unsupported WSGI framework**.
