To integrate the Python agent with your app, you can run the newrelic-admin script in front of your usual app startup command, or you can use the Python agent [API](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/python-agent-api/guide-using-python-agent-api/).

If you start your app with `daphne path_to_app:my_app` and use our Python agent **version 8.0.0.179** or higher, you can use the recommended admin script integration method. The admin script was included when you downloaded the Python agent, and you can use a command like this:

```
NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=<var>path/to/</var>newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program daphne path_to_app:my_app
```

  If you have difficulty with this automatic initialization, you can also try our manual instrumentation steps. To get those instructions, go back to the framework question and select **Unsupported ASGI framework**.
