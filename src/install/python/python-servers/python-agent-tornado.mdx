To integrate the Python agent with your app, you can run the newrelic-admin script in front of your usual app startup command, or you can use the Python agent [API](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/python-agent-api/guide-using-python-agent-api/).

<Callout variant="important">
  The Python agent does not support any versions of Tornado below 6.0.
</Callout>

You can use the recommended admin script integration method, provided you start your app with `python app.py` and use the Tornado async interface. The admin script was included when you downloaded the Python agent, and you can use a command like this:

```
NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=<var>path/to/</var>newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-python app.py
```

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you have difficulty with this automatic initialization, you can also try our manual instrumentation steps. To get those instructions, go back to the framework question and select **Unsupported WSGI framework**.
