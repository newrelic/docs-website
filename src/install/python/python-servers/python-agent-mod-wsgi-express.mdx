If you are using `mod_wsgi-express` version 4.1.0 with a WSGI application, you can use the script's `--with-newrelic` option with your app's startup command. Although the `mod_wsgi-express` script and `--with-newrelic` flag are different than the `newrelic-admin` script used for most frameworks, they serve the same purpose of configuring your application to wrap the execution of your server.

For example, using the agent with Django may require a command similar to the following:

```
NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini mod_wsgi-express start-server <var>mysite</var>/wsgi.py --with-newrelic
```

For more details, contact the Apache/mod_wsgi author on the [mod_wsgi mailing list](http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/WhereToGetHelp?tm=6#Asking_Your).

  If you have difficulty with this automatic initialization, you can also try our manual instrumentation steps. To get those instructions, go back to the framework question and select **Unsupported ASGI framework**.
