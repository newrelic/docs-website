Do you want to monitor the performance of your Python application? You can do this by installing our Python agent! It is a powerful tool that collects telemetry about your application and then forwards that data to New Relic. Once the data is in New Relic, you can view a wide range of UI pages that give you insights into what's happening with your software.

## Start our interactive instructions

This page is interactive, which means we'll ask you some questions about your environment so we can give you specific steps to install the Python agent. Here's what we want to know:

1. Do you want to monitor a non-web Python app?
2. Do you want to monitor a Python web app in Docker?
3. What kind of Python framework are you using?
4. What kind of Python server are you using?

After you make your selections in the form below, you'll get customized steps for your environment. If you change your mind after making some selections, click **Reset the form** to start again:
