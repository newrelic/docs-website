Download and install the agent package using one of these options:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="pip"
    title="pip install (RECOMMENDED)"
  >
    Install the **newrelic** package directly from PyPi by running:

    ```
    pip install newrelic
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="easy_install"
    title="easy_install"
  >
    Run:

    ```
    easy_install newrelic
    ```

    We recommend using pip install, because pip will correctly remove old versions of the agent when upgrading.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="buildout"
    title="Buildout install"
  >
    Install the package by creating an appropriate section for the **newrelic** package using the `zc.recipe.egg` recipe.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="manual"
    title="Manual download and install"
  >
    To obtain the package manually:

    1. Download the appropriate **tar.gz** file from our [download site](https://download.newrelic.com/python_agent/release).
    2. Unpack the **tar.gz** file.
    3. In the top directory of the unpacked package, install it by running:

       ```
       python setup.py install
       ```

       <Callout variant="tip">
         This should be the `python` executable for the Python installation or virtual environment where you want to install the Python agent software. If installing into a system-wide Python installation, use the `sudo` command or run the command as root.
