headingText: Get your license key

You'll need a valid New Relic license key to install the Python agent. License keys are available to those who have a New Relic account, so if you don't already have a New Relic account, [sign up](https://newrelic.com/signup?via=login). It's free, forever!

Once you have an account, go to the [API keys page](https://one.newrelic.com/api-keys) in the UI and click **Create a key**, and then create an ingest-license key type. If you already have an existing license key, click **...**, then click **Copy key**.

If you'd like to read more about how we use API keys, see [New Relic API keys](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys).
