You need to integrate the Python agent with your application so that your app's major functions and web requests are received by the agent. If you're using a PasteDeploy with a configuration file, see the instructions immediately below. Otherwise, as long as you're using the `paste.httpserver.serve()` API function, there are no specific steps you need to take to integrate with Paste. You can skip straight to the server-specific instructions in the next step.

### Using PasteDeploy [#paste-deploy]

Instead of manually integrating the call to startup the Paste WSGI server in your application code, you might be using PasteDeploy with a configuration file like the following:

```
[server:main]
use = egg:Paste#http
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 8080
```

When you start up your WSGI application, wrap the running of the `paster` command:

```
NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program paster serve production.ini
```
