headingText: Review the manual initialization steps for unsupported WSGI frameworks
---

It sounds like you're using an unsupported framework, such as mod_wsgi. In cases like this, you can follow the manual initialization steps here.

<Callout variant="important">
  In some cases, you may be able to skip this manual instrumentation of your unsupported framework if you're also using a supported server. If you are using a supported server, you can try skipping ahead to the next step and following the instructions for the server.
</Callout>

### Manual initialization in app code [#manual-integration]

Since you're not using a supported framework, you won't be able to use our admin script that automatically initializes your app; rather, you must initialize the Python agent manually in your web app code. This process involves importing a Python agent package into your app and making a call to initialize the agent. This call modifies your app's import mechanism so that when libraries are imported, the agent listens for the function classes it recognizes.

To get started, add the following to the beginning of the application script file or module that holds your WSGI entry point. In this example, <var>/some/path/newrelic.ini</var> represents the location of the copy of the config file created earlier. The config file must be readable by your web application.

```
import newrelic.agent
newrelic.agent.<a href="/docs/agents/python-agent/python-agent-api/initialize">initialize</a>('<var>/some/path</var>/newrelic.ini')
<var>... YOUR_OTHER_IMPORTS</var>
```
<Callout variant="important">
  Unlike standard Python functionality, the import order matters: the agent package must be imported and initialized first.
</Callout>

### (Advanced) Configuration file overrides [#overrides]

If you want to override configurations, here are some options:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="environment-override"
    title="Admin script with deployment environment overrides"
  >
    To specify an override in the agent config file that corresponds to a specific deployment environment, supply the environment's name as the second argument to the [`initialize()` function](/docs/agents/python-agent/python-agent-api/initialize). If you have installed the Python package into a Python virtual environment, you must add these lines after you have activated or set up **sys.path** to find your virtual environment.

    ```
    import newrelic.agent
    newrelic.agent.initialize('<var>/some/path</var>/newrelic.ini', 'staging')
    ```

    Whenever possible, precede any imports for modules that are going to be instrumented. For some web frameworks, including Flask, this is mandatory. The instrumentation will not work correctly if not placed before all imports that cause code from that framework to be imported.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="manual-override"
    title="Manual configuration with deployment environment overrides"
  >
    If you do not use the admin script but still want to use the environment variables `NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE` and `NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT` to configure the agent, you can call the `initialize()` function with no arguments, and they will be read automatically.

    ```
    import newrelic.agent
    newrelic.agent.initialize()
    ```

    Alternatively, you can set the `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` and `NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME` environment variables if the defaults for all other configuration settings are suitable.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="embedded"
    title="Embedded environment overrides"
  >
    With embedded environments such as Apache/mod_wsgi, in general you cannot rely on being able to derive configuration from environment variables. This is because typically in embedded systems, you cannot set process environment variables which are in turn available to the WSGI script file. For more information, see the documentation for the [initialize()](/docs/python/python-management-api#initialize) function.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>


### Additional instrumentation [#additional]

If you are using an unsupported web framework or are constructing a WSGI application using a WSGI component library such as Werkzeug or Paste, you may also need to manually wrap the WSGI application entry point. This is in addition to doing one of the main integration methods ([using the admin script](#wrapper-script), or [manually initializing the Python agent](#manual-integration)).

If the WSGI application entry point is a function declared in the file itself, use a decorator:

```
@newrelic.agent.wsgi_application()
def application(environ, start_response):
...
```

If the WSGI application entry point is a function or object imported from a different module, wrap it with a wrapper object:

```
import myapp
application = myapp.WSGIHandler()

application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application)
```

If a supported web framework is being used, you can still use the decorator or wrapper explicitly if, for example, you want to configure additional WSGI middleware around the supported web framework. This will ensure that execution of all WSGI middleware is also covered by the monitoring done by the agent.

For more information, see the documentation for the [wsgi_application()](/docs/python/python-instrumentation-api#wsgi_application) and [WSGIApplicationWrapper](/docs/python/python-instrumentation-api#WSGIApplicationWrapper) wrapper.
