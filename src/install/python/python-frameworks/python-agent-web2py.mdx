You need to integrate the Python agent with your application so that your app's major functions and web requests are received by the agent. If you're using the `runweb2py` command, see instructions immediately below. Otherwise, there are no specific steps you need to take to integrate with Web2Py, so skip straight to the server-specific instructions in the next step.

### How to use with runweb2py [#runweb2py-tip]

If you run your web application using the **runweb2py** command, use the following:

```
NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=<var>/some/path/</var>newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program runweb2py
```

`newrelic-admin` is a script that wraps your application startup, so that the agent can monitor your application's major functions. For more on running the wrapper script, see [Running the wrapper script](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-installation#integration).
