The guided install is the easiest and simplest way to install the PostgreSQL integration while providing maximum control. It also offers a quickstart option that includes optional pre-built resources, such as dashboards and alerts, alongside the PostgreSQL integration, so you can gain instant visibility into your database.

As per your region, click one of the following buttons to start the guided install.
