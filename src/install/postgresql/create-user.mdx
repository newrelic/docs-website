Make sure you have a user with the required permissions or create one with `SELECT` permissions on:

* `pg_stat_database`
* `pg_stat_database_conflicts`
* `pg_stat_bgwriter`

To create the user for the PostgreSQL integration, run these commands:

```sql
CREATE USER new_relic WITH PASSWORD MY_PASSWORD;
GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database TO new_relic;
GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_database_conflicts TO new_relic;
GRANT SELECT ON pg_stat_bgwriter TO new_relic;
```

This will allow the integration to gather global metrics related to the PostgreSQL instance.
