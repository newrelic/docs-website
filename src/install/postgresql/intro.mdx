<Callout title="Preview">
    We're still working on query-level monitoring feature of this integration, but we'd love for you to try it out!

    This feature is currently provided as part of a preview pursuant to our [pre-release policies](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy/).
</Callout>

The New Relic PostgreSQL [on-host integration](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations) receives and sends inventory metrics from your PostgreSQL instance to the New Relic platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. Data from instances, databases, and clusters helps you find the source of problems.

<Callout variant="important">
  For best results, regularly [update the integration package](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/installation/update-infrastructure-host-integration-package) and [the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/update-infrastructure-agent).
</Callout>
