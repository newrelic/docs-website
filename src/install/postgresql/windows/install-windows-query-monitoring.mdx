You can view query-level analysis to assess the performance and impact of your SQL queries in your PostgreSQL database. This feature provides insights into execution times, resource consumption, and potential bottlenecks, enabling you to optimize database operations. For more information, refer [Query-Level Analysis](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructure-data/query-level-monitoring).

**Prerequisites:**

* PostgreSQL version is 12 or later.
* Enable the `pg_stat_statements` extension. For more information, refer [Enabling extensions](#enabling-extensions).


1. To retrieve slow running queries and blocking sessions, install the `pg_stat_statements` extension:

    1. Open the `postgresql.conf` file:

        ```shell
        C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<version>\data\postgresql.conf
        ```
    2. Add extensions to shared_preload_libraries in `postgresql.conf`

        ```shell
        shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'
        pg_stat_statements.max = 10000    # Maximum number of statements tracked
        pg_stat_statements.track = all    # Track all statements
        pg_stat_statements.save = on      # Save statistics across server restarts
        ```

2. To restart the PostgreSQL server, run:

    ```shell
    net stop postgresql-x64-<version>
    net start postgresql-x64-<version>
    ```

3. To connect to the PostgreSQL server, run:

    ```shell
    psql -U postgres
    ```

4. To enable the extensions for your database, run:

    ```shell
    CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;
    ```

5. To grant the required permissions, run:

    ```shell
    psql -U postgres
    GRANT pg_read_all_stats TO newrelic;
    GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO your_username;
    ```
