New Relic's VMware vSphere integration helps you understand the health and performance of your vSphere environment. You can:

* Query data to get insights on the performance on your hypervisors, virtual machines, and more.
* Go from high level views down to the most granular data.
* Instrument and monitor multiple vSphere instances using the same account.
* Collect data on snapshots, VMs, hosts, resource pools, clusters, and datastores, including tags.
* Monitor the health of your hypervisors and VMs using our charts and dashboards.
* Use the data retrieved to monitor key performance and key capacity scaling indicators.
* Set <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> based on any metrics collected from vCenter.
* Create [workloads](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-one-workloads-isolate-resolve-incidents-faster) to group resources and focus on key data.

Our integration uses the [vSphere API](https://code.vmware.com/apis/704/vsphere) to collect metrics and events generated by all vSphere's components, and forwards the data to our platform via the infrastructure agent.

  **Use guided install to quickly see your data in the UI**

  The guided install is a single CLI command you can run to monitor your MongoDB instance. It's a good option for small organizations, or for anyone who wants to test out New Relic.

  For a more permanent and scalable solution, we recommend the standard manual install of the agent: keep reading for how to do that.

## Requirements and compatability:

* Our integration is compatible with vSphere from versions 11.2 to 21.
* Linux distro [compatible with infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-infrastructure), except for RHEL/CentOS/OEL versions lower than 7.
* [vSphere Instant Client](http://www.vSphere.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/instant-client/downloads/index.html) on the agent box.
