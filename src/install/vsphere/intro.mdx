New Relic's VMware vSphere integration helps you understand the health and performance of your vSphere environment. You can:

* Query data to get insights on the performance on your hypervisors, virtual machines, and more.
* Go from high level views down to the most granular data.
* Instrument and monitor multiple vSphere instances using the same account.
* Collect data on snapshots, VMs, hosts, resource pools, clusters, and datastores, including tags.
* Monitor the health of your hypervisors and VMs using our charts and dashboards.
* Use the data retrieved to monitor key performance and key capacity scaling indicators.
* Set <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> based on any metrics collected from vCenter.
* Create [workloads](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/workloads/workloads-isolate-resolve-alert-events-faster) to group resources and focus on key data.

Our integration uses the [vSphere API](https://code.vmware.com/apis/704/vsphere) to collect metrics and events generated by all vSphere's components, and forwards the data to our platform via the infrastructure agent.

  **Use guided install to quickly see your data in the UI**

  The guided install is a single CLI command you can run to monitor your MongoDB instance. It's a good option for small organizations, or for anyone who wants to test out New Relic.

  For a more permanent and scalable solution, we recommend the standard manual install of the agent: keep reading for how to do that.

## Requirements and compatibility

* Our integration is compatible with VMware vSphere 6.5 or higher.
* [Infrastructure agent installed on the host](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic).
* vCenter service account having at least read-only global permissions with the `propagate to children` option checked.

  <DNT>**Large environments:**</DNT> In environments with more than 800 virtual machines, the integration cannot report all data and may fail. We offer a workaround that will preserve all metrics and events, but it will disable entity registration. To apply the workaround, add the following environment variable to the configuration file:

  ```yaml
  integrations:
  - name: nri-vsphere
    env:
      # Integration configuration parameters.

      EVENTS: true
      METRICS: true

  ```
