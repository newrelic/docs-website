* Our integration is compatible with VMware vSphere 6.5 or higher.
* [Infrastructure agent installed on the host](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic).
* vCenter service account having at least read-only global permissions with the `propagate to children` option checked.

<Callout variant="important">
  <DNT>**Large environments:**</DNT> In environments with more than 800 virtual machines, the integration cannot report all data and may fail. We offer a workaround that will preserve all metrics and events, but it will disable entity registration. To apply the workaround, add the following environment variable to the configuration file:

  ```yaml
  integrations:
  - name: nri-vsphere
    env:
      # Integration configuration parameters.

      EVENTS: true
      METRICS: true

  ```
</Callout>
