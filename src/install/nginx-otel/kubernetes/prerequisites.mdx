Before deploying the collector, ensure you have:

- `kubectl` access to the target cluster and the namespace where you'll deploy the collector.
- Helm installed locally and pointed at the same kube context.
- NGINX pods that expose the stub status endpoint through a ClusterIP Service reachable by the collector.
- A New Relic license key stored securely for later steps.
