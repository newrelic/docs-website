1. Check that the collector pods are running:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n newrelic -l app.kubernetes.io/name=opentelemetry-collector
   ```
2. Inspect the Helm release status for additional diagnostics:
   ```bash
   helm status nginx-otel-collector -n newrelic
   ```
3. Review the collector logs if you need to troubleshoot scrape or export issues:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs deploy/nginx-otel-collector -n newrelic --tail=50
   ```
4. Run an NRQL query in New Relic to confirm data is arriving. Replace the cluster name with the value you set in the values file:

   ```sql
   SELECT entity.guid
   FROM Metric
   WHERE metricName LIKE 'nginx.%'
     AND instrumentation.provider = 'opentelemetry'
     AND k8s.cluster.name = 'nginx-cluster'
   SINCE 10 minutes ago
   ```

If the query returns results, New Relic is receiving NGINX metrics from your cluster. Otherwise, review the collector logs for connection errors or missing permissions.
