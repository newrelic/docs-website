Each NGINX pod must expose the HTTP stub status module so the collector can scrape metrics.

1. Add a location block similar to the following to your NGINX configuration, then reload the deployment:

   ```nginx
   location /status {
     stub_status on;
   }
   ```
2. Record the path (without the leading slash) and the port serving the stub status endpoint. Defaults are `status` on port `80` or `8080`.
3. Verify the endpoint from within one of your pods:

   ```bash
   kubectl exec deploy/<your-nginx-deployment> -- curl -I http://127.0.0.1:8080/status 2>/dev/null | head -n 1 | cut -d$' ' -f1,2
   ```

Expect an `HTTP/1.1 200` response. Adjust the command to match your deployment name, port, and path.
