Our NGINX OpenTelemetry integration helps you stream metrics and logs from NGINX (open source or NGINX Plus) through the OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib distribution. Once the collector forwards data via OTLP, you can explore it in New Relic dashboards, charts, and alerts.

To get the most from this guide, decide where your NGINX workloads run and select the matching install path. You need a [New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup) and a license key to complete the setup.
