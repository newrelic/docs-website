Configure and enable the [HTTP API module](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_api_module.html) to expose metrics from your NGINX Plus server.

After updating `nginx.conf`, test and reload the service:

```bash
sudo nginx -t && sudo nginx -s reload
```

Confirm the API endpoint path (including version) exposed in your configuration.

Record the full API endpoint path (without the leading slash) and the port that serves it. Common defaults are `api/9` on port `8080`.

Use `curl` to confirm your API endpoint is reachable:

```bash
curl -I http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/9 2>/dev/null | head -n 1 | cut -d$' ' -f1,2
```

Expected output:

```
HTTP/1.1 200
```

If you see a different response, verify your NGINX Plus configuration and ensure the API module is properly enabled.
