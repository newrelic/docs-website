The OpenTelemetry Collector sends data to New Relic using OTLP. You'll need a New Relic [license key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#license-key) so the collector can authenticate.

- If you manage multiple accounts, choose the account where you want the NGINX data to appear.
- Store the key securely; you'll reference it in the collector environment configuration and when creating secrets for other environments.
