You can use our [log forwarding](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/) documentation to forward application specific logs to New Relic.

On installing infrastructure agent on the linux machines, your log file named `logging.yml` should be present in this path: `/etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/`.

If you don't see your log file in the above path, then you will need to create a log file by following the above log forwarding documentation.

Here is an example of the log name which will look similar as below:

```yml
- name: flink-u1-taskexecutor-0-u1-VirtualBox.log
```

Add the below script to the `logging.yml` file to send Apache Flink logs to New Relic.

```yml
logs:
  - name: flink-<REST_OF_THE_FILE_NAME>.log 
    file: <FLINK-DIRECTORY>/log/flink-<REST_OF_THE_FILE_NAME>.log
    attributes:
      logtype: flink_logs
```
