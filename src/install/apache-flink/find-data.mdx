Data from this integration can be found by going to: **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Infrastructure > Third-party services > Apache Flink**.

Apache Flink data is ingested as [Dimensional Metrics](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#dimensional-metrics). You can [query this data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data) for troubleshooting purposes or to create custom charts and dashboards.

You can use NRQL to [query your data](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-nrql-tutorial/). For example, if you want to view the total number of completed checkpoints on New Relic's Query Builder, use this NRQL query:

```sql
FROM Metric SELECT latest(flink_jobmanager_job_numberOfCompletedCheckpoints) AS 'Number of Completed Checkpoints'
```
