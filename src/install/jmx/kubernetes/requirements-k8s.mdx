Before installing the integration, make sure that you meet these requirements:

* Java Runtime Environment 7 or higher.
* If you don't have one already, [create a New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup). It's free, forever.
* A Linux distribution compatible with New Relic infrastructure agent.
* Our integration is compatible and is continuously tested on Kubernetes versions 1.24 to 1.28.
* Kubernetes integration is compatible with different flavors. Check [this table](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/get-started/kubernetes-integration-compatibility-requirements/) to have more info about it.
* If you're using Helm:

  * Make sure [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm#install) is installed on your machine. Version 3 of the Kubernetes integration requires Helm version 3.

  * Find and copy your license key.

  * Choose a display name for your cluster. For example, you could use the output of:

    ```shell
    kubectl config current-context
    ```
