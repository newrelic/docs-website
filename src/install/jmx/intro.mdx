Our JMX integration allows users to monitor any application that exposes metrics with JMX. The integration includes a default collection file. It collects key metrics from the JVM. The collected metrics vary by app server and include measurements of thread pools, HTTP sessions, and transactions.

Read on to install the integration and to see what data we collect.

  If you're not running JMX in Kubernetes or ECS environments, we recommend our guided install. Our guided install uses our infrastructure agent and our CLI to set up the JMX integration. It also finds other applications and log sources in your environment. Then, it recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, there are other install options below.

For a more permanent and scalable solution, we recommend the standard manual install of the agent. Keep reading for how to do that.
