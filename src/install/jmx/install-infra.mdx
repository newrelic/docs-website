headingText: Install the infrastructure agent

To use the JMX integration, you need to also [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic/) on the same host. The infrastructure agent monitors the host. The integration you'll install adds JMX-specific data. This data includes metrics for the database and instances.
