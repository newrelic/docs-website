To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with [replication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_replication-client) and [select](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_select) permissions to allow the integration to fetch metrics.

1. From the command line, create a user `newrelic@localhost` with a specific password by running:
   ```shell
   mysql -e "CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;"
   ```

2. Grant replication privileges to `newrelic@localhost`, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running:
   ```shell
   mysql -e "GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;"
   ```

3. Grant privileges to `newrelic@localhost`, with a maximum of 5 connections, by running:
   ```shell
   mysql -e "GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;"
   ```
