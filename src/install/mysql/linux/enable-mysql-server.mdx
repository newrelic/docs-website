To capture data from the MySQL integration, you must first create a MySQL user with the necessary permissions for integration to fetch metrics: 

* [REPLICATION CLIENT](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_replication-client)
* [SELECT](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_select)
* [PROCESS](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_process)

**To create a user and provide permissions:**

1. To create a user `newrelic@localhost` with a specific password, run the following command:
   ```shell
   mysql -e "CREATE USER 'newrelic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY $YOUR_PASSWORD WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;"
   ```

2. To grant replication privileges to `newrelic@localhost`, run the following command:
   ```shell
   mysql -e "GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;"
   ```

3. To grant select privileges to `newrelic@localhost`, run the following command:
   ```shell
   mysql -e "GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;"
   ```

4. To grant process privileges to `newrelic@localhost`, run the following command:
   ```shell
   mysql -e "GRANT PROCESS ON *.* TO 'newrelic'@'localhost' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 5;"
   ```
