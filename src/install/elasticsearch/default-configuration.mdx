headingText: Configure the Elasticsearch integration 
---

Edit the `elasticsearch-config.yml` file. This example config file collects all metrics and inventory from your localhost:

```yml
integrations:
  - name: nri-elasticsearch
    env:
      HOSTNAME: localhost
      PORT: 9200
      USERNAME: elasticsearch_user
      PASSWORD: elasticsearch_password
      CONFIG_PATH: /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
    interval: 15s
    labels:
      environment: production
    inventory_source: config/elasticsearch
```

You can find all the config options at the bottom of this doc along with more complex config examples.
