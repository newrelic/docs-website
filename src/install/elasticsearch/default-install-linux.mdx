1. Change directory to the integrations configuration folder by running:

   ```shell
   cd /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d
   ```

2. Copy the sample configuration file by running:

   ```shell
   sudo cp  elasticsearch-config.yml.sample  elasticsearch-config.yml
   ```

3. Edit the ` elasticsearch-config.yml` file. This example config file collects all metrics and inventory from your localhost:

   ```yml
   integrations:
     - name: nri-elasticsearch
       env:
         HOSTNAME: localhost
         PORT: 9200
         USERNAME: elasticsearch_user
         PASSWORD: elasticsearch_password
         CONFIG_PATH: /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
       interval: 15s
       labels:
         environment: production
       inventory_source: config/elasticsearch
   ```

You can find all the config options at the bottom of this doc along with more complex config examples.
