headingText: Configure the Elasticsearch integration

1. In the integrations directory, `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\integrations.d\`, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running:

   ```shell
   copy elasticsearch-config.yml.sample elasticsearch-config.yml
   ```

2. Edit the ` elasticsearch-config.yml` file. This example config file collects all metrics and inventory from your localhost:

   ```
   integrations:
   - name: nri-elasticsearch
       env:
       HOSTNAME: localhost
       PORT: 9200
       USERNAME: elasticsearch_user
       PASSWORD: elasticsearch_password
       CONFIG_PATH: /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
       interval: 15s
       labels:
       environment: production
       inventory_source: config/elasticsearch
   ```

You can find all the config options at the bottom of this doc along with more complex config examples.
