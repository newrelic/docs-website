To get started with monitoring a video player in your browser application, add our video agent in your application. Install the video agent by adding a snippet of javascript code. 

## Prerequisites [#before-start]

If you haven't done so, you may want to check that your browser app meets our [compatibility and requirements](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-browser-monitoring) and also check the [compatibility and requirements](/docs/streaming-video-&-ads/installation/browser/compatibility-requirements/media-agent-for-browser) for the Media Agent for browser.

## Install the browser video agent [#install]
