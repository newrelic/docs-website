<Callout variant="tip">
    Add our streaming agent to an application that already has our browser agent installed. If you are a first time user and want to add the video agent to a new application, see [Instrument a new browser application](/install/browser-media/?task=newapplication).
</Callout>

    1. Integrate video monitoring into your application by copying the following code snippet and pasting it immediately below the existing browser agent code to start monitoring your video player.

      <img
          width="80%;"
          title="code snippet"
          alt="code snippet"
          src="/images/code-snippet.webp"
      />
      
    2. Click <DNT>**See your data**</DNT> to complete the setup.
