## Configuration options [#config-options]

The following are various configuration options for your integration.

### Command-line arguments

If run at command line without anything, the executable should report JSON results from WMI queries specified in `config.json` to stdout, and any error messages to stderr. This is useful for testing and debugging your counter/query configuration.

* `-c | --configFile [file]`: Config file to use (default: `config.json`)
* `-i | --pollInt [nnn]`: Frequency of polling (ms) (default: 10000ms, ignored if less than 10000ms)
* `-n | --compName [name]`: Name of computer that you want to poll (default: local host)
* `-r | --runOnce [true|false]`: Run this integration once and exit, instead of polling (default: false)
* `-g | --ignoreInfoLogs [true|false]`: Ignores logs of log type Info (default: false)
* `-v | --verbose [true|false]`: [Verbose Logging Mode](#verbose-logging-mode) (default: false)

Verbose logging mode is meant for testing your counters and seeing if and how they will appear in NRDB. With verbose logging mode enabled, the following occurs:
* All log messages are written to stderr
* Metrics are pretty-printed to stderr
* No messages will appear in Event Logs
* No metrics are written to stdout
* **NRDB will not show any data from this Integration when running it in Verbose Logging Mode.**

Because stderr messages arent picked up by the NRI Agent in Windows, it is best to use this mode at command line, like so:
```batch
C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\custom-integrations> nri-perfmon\nri-perfmon.exe -v -c C:\path\to\custom_config.json
```

## Counters

* Out-of-the-box, we have collected a set of Perfmon counters that pertain to .NET applications. 
* We have a library of pre-built config files that you can use, **[found here.](nri-perfmon/config)** Contributions to this library by way of Pull Request are welcome!
* If you would like to collect your own counters, customize the `counterlist` in `config.json`, or create your own config file and use `-c your_config_file.json` at execution.

### `config.json` Format

```json
{
  "counterlist": [{
      "provider": "provider_name|PerfCounter",
      "category": "category_name",
      "instance": "(optional) instance_name",
      "counters": [{
          "counter": "*|counter_name"
        },
        {
          "counter": "another_counter_name"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "eventname": "(optional, default: 'WMIQueryResult') insights_event_name",
      "query": "the_whole_WMI_Query",
      "querynamespace": "(optional, default: 'root//cimv2') query_namespace",
      "querytype": "(optional, default: 'wmi_query') wmi_query|wmi_eventlistener",
      "counters": [{
          "counter": "counter_name|counter_class.counter_name",
          "attrname": "(optional) attribute_name_in_insights_event",
          "parser": "regex_to_parse_attribute_value"
        },
        {
          "counter": "another_counter_name"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Simple queries

_**For a walkthrough of creating a Simple Query, please see [TIPS.md](TIPS.md).**_

* The "`provider`, `category`, (optional) `instance`" form of the counter is for building simple queries, with the following limitations:
  * Uses the default namespace (`root/cimv2`)
  * Limited to Select statements against classes with the name `Win32_PerfFormattedData_{provider}_{category}`
  * No custom names for individual attributes
  * Uses the category name as the Insights event type.
* The `instance` property is optional and should *only* be used if you want to show a specific instance.
  * If left out, all instances will be polled automatically.
  * If there are multiple instances returned by the counter|query, each instance name will appear in the `name` attribute of the event.
* You must have at least one `counter` specified in `counters`. You can use wildcard ('\*') as the value to get all counters for that class.

Example of usage:
```json
{
  "provider": "ASPNET",
  "category": "ASPNETApplications",
  "counters": [
    {
      "counter": "RequestsTotal"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Performance counters

If you specify the `provider` as `PerfCounter`, it will retrieve the Windows Performance Counter instead of running a WMI query. This can be useful if WMI is returning "all 0's" in a query or the appropriate Performance Counter is easier to find [Click here for a good how-to on using Performance Monitor.](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Ask-The-Performance-Team/Windows-Performance-Monitor-Overview/ba-p/375481)

* No custom names for individual attributes
* Uses the category name as the Insights event type.
* The `instance` property is optional and should *only* be used if you want to show a specific instance.
  * If left out, all instances will be polled automatically.
  * If there are multiple instances returned by the counter|query, each instance name will appear in the `name` attribute of the event.
* You must have at least one `counter` specified in `counters`. You can use wildcard ('\*') as the value to get all counters for that class.

Example of usage:
```json
{
  "provider": "PerfCounter",
  "category": "ASP.NET Apps v4.0.30319",
  "counters": [
    {
      "counter": "Requests Total"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Complex queries & event listeners

* `eventname` (optional) - The event name you wish to create in Insights with the results of your query.
* `query` - The WMI query to be run.
* `querytype` (optional) - only used to run an event listener instead of a typical WMI Query (set to `wmi_eventlistener`)
	* This listener will operate as a separate thread, so that it doesn't impede other queries from running.
* `querynamespace` (optional) - allows you to access any WMI namespace.
	* If set, this query will operate as a separate thread, so that it doesn't impede other queries that use the default namespace.
	* Any escape characters (`\`) must be doubled (`\\`)
* `eventtype` (optional) - set that query's result events in Insights to anything specified here.
* `counters` (optional) - used to specify counters to extract from the query, and transformations to perform on them.
	* If not performing any transformations, you can specify counters in the query itself (i.e. "`Select Name, Description, DeviceID from Win32_PNPEntity`) and out this section.
	* Multiple `counters` entries *can* be against the same counter (see example below).
		* They will need to write to different attributes, otherwise they will overwrite one another.
	* `counter` - the counter name you want to extract/match. Must be exact.
	* `attrname` (optional) - use to rename the counter.
		* If used, that counter name will be renamed in the Insights event to the value set here.
		* If left out, the attribute in Insights will be named with the original name of that counter.
	* `parser` (optional) - use a regular expression to parse an attribute value.
		* It can only be used on Strings. It will be ignored for all other counter types.
		* Any escape characters (`\`) must be doubled (`\\`)
		* If used, the counter value will be matched against the regular expression provided here.
		* If it doesn't match, the original value of the counter will be returned.
		* If it matches and you used groups, the result will be a concatenized string of all of the groups.
		* If it matches and you didn't use groups, the result will be the portion of the string that matched.

Example of usage:
```json
{
	"eventname": "HyperV_GuestNetworkAdapter",
	"query": "SELECT InstanceId, DHCPEnabled, DNSServers, IPAddresses FROM Msvm_GuestNetworkAdapterConfiguration",
	"querynamespace": "ROOT\\virtualization\\v2",
	"counters": [{
			"counter": "InstanceId",
			"attrname": "Name",
			"parser": "Microsoft:GuestNetwork\\\\([0-9A-F-]+)\\\\[0-9A-F-]+"
		},
		{
			"counter": "InstanceId",
			"attrname": "AdapterId",
			"parser": "Microsoft:GuestNetwork\\\\[0-9A-F-]+\\\\([0-9A-F-]+)"
		},
		{ "counter": "DHCPEnabled" },
		{ "counter": "DNSServers" },
		{
			"counter": "IPAddresses",
			"attrName": "IPAddress",
			"parser": "([0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3})"
		},
		{ "counter": "IPAddresses" }
	]
},
```

Notes:
* To retrieve properties from within a counter object, use the format `counter.property`, i.e. `targetInstance.DeviceID`
* If there are multiple instances returned by the counter|query, each instance name will appear in the `name` attribute of the event.
