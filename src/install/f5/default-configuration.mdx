Edit the `F5-config.yml` file to configure your integration as needed. The following example config fills in all the required options and reports all metrics the integration pulls:

```yml
integrations:
  - name: nri-f5
    env:
      HOSTNAME: localhost
      PORT: 443
      USERNAME: f5_user
      PASSWORD: f5_password
    interval: 15s
    labels:
      environment: production
    inventory_source: config/f5
```
