Gain deep insights into F5 performance with seamless data integration into New Relic. Our F5 BIG-IP [integration](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations) collects and sends inventory and metrics from your F5 BIG-IP instance to our platform, where you can aggregate and visualize key performance metrics. We collect data at the system, application, pool, pool member, virtual server, and node levels.

  **Use guided install to quickly see your data in the UI**

  The guided install is a single CLI command you can run to monitor your F5 instance. It's a good option for small organizations, or for anyone who wants to test out New Relic.
