headingText: Configure the F5 integration

1. In the Integrations directory, `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\integrations.d\`, create a copy of the sample configuration file by running:

   ```shell
   copy F5-config.yml.sample F5-config.yml
   ```

2. Edit the `F5-config.yml` file. Here's a basic configuration example:

   ```yml
   integrations:
     - name: nri-f5
       env:
         HOSTNAME: localhost
         PORT: 443
         USERNAME: f5_user
         PASSWORD: f5_password
         interval: 15s
       labels:
         environment: production
       inventory_source: config/f5
   ```

You can find all the config options at the bottom of this doc along with more complex config examples.
