The Ansible role with New Relic's infrastructure agent requires a [supported operating system](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-new-relic-infrastructure#operating-systems).

If you need help with Ansible for Windows OS, take a look at [Setting up a Windows Host](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/os_guide/windows_setup.html), from the [Ansible Documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/) site.

This role is tested with the Ansible Core 2.13 and 2.14 and Python 3.10. Ansible Core versions before 2.10 are not supported.
