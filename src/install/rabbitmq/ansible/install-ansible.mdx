1. Go to [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/newrelic/newrelic_install).

   ```shell
   ansible-galaxy install newrelic.newrelic_install
   ```

2. Make sure you have `ansible.windows` and `ansible.utils` installed. Run this command if they're not installed:

   ```shell
   ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.windows ansible.utils
   ```

3. Include the `newrelic.newrelic_install` role in your playbook. Here is an example of configuring your role to install the infrastructure agent:

   ```yml
   ---
   - name: Install New Relic
     hosts: all
     roles:
       - role: newrelic.newrelic_install
         vars:
           targets:
             - infrastructure
             - logs
           tags:
             foo: bar
     environment:
       NEW_RELIC_API_KEY: <API key>
       NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID: <Account ID>
       NEW_RELIC_REGION: <Region>
   ```

4. Customize the required variables.

Go to [Configure the infrastructure agent using Ansible](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/config-management-tools/configure-infrastructure-agent-using-ansible/) if you need more information.
