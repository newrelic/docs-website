* Our integration is compatible with IBM MQ 9.0 or higher.

* Make sure that you have the [IBM MQ Redistributable Client libraries](https://public.dhe.ibm.com/ibmdl/export/pub/software/websphere/messaging/mqdev/redist/) installed on the host where the agent and the integration are running.

* Add the libraries path in the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable in Linux.

* Ensure [queue statistics monitoring](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/capmp/8.1.4?topic=monitoring-enabling-queue-statistics-queue-manager-mq) is enabled on MQ.

* [Create a user](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/mq-appliance/9.1?topic=commands-usercreate-create-user) in MQ with read-only permissions.
