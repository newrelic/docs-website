Our IBM MQ [integration](/docs/integrations/host-integrations/getting-started/introduction-host-integrations)
collects and sends dimensional metrics from [IBM MQ](https://www.ibm.com/products/mq).

You can view this [metric data](#metrics) in pre-built dashboards, create alerts policies, and create custom queries and charts.

To get data from IBM MQ infrastructure, our IBM MQ integration uses a third-party [Prometheus exporter](https://github.com/ibm-messaging/mq-metric-samples/tree/master/cmd/mq_prometheus), which exposes Prometheus metrics on the port specified in the configuration. The integration collects these metrics, filters them, and then sends them to New Relic.
