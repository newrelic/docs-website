1. Run this command in your CLI to clone the New Relic Snowflake repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-snowflake-integration.git
   ```

2. From the `releases` section, download the [`snowflakeintegration-linux`
   binary](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-snowflake-integration/releases), and place it in the cloned repo. Make sure the binary is executable by running:

   ```bash
   chmod +x snowflakeintegration-linux
   ```

3. To ensure you're using the newest info for the integration, update your `config.yaml` file. Make the file match the snippet in Snowflake's [Key Pair authentication](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-snowflake-integration#key-pair-authentication) section.

4. Run this command to know if you're on a system using a `systemd` service:

   ```bash
   [[ `\systemctl` =~ -\.mount ]] && echo yes || echo no 
   ```

   If the New Relic infrastructure agent is running as a `systemd` service, [set the environment variable](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-snowflake-integration#when-the-agent-is-running-as-a-systemd-service).

   Otherwise, set the `NEWRELIC_SNOWFLAKE_HOME` environment variable as documented in the [Setting NEWRELIC_SNOWFLAKE_HOME](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-snowflake-integration/tree/main#setting-newrelic_snowflake_home) section.

5. Copy the relevant flex config for your platform from [flexConfigs](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-snowflake-integration/tree/main/flexConfigs) to the agent's `integrations.d` folder:

   * for Linux: `/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/`
   * for Windows: `C:\Program Files\New Relic\newrelic-infra\integrations.d\`
