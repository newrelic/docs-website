You can see your critical Snowflake data in New Relic after installing the [Snowflake quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/snowflake).

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Metrics & events**</DNT>.

2. Run either NRQL queries to view your Snowflake metrics:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM SnowflakeAccount
   ```

   or

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM SnowflakeVirtualWarehouse
   ```

3. Once you've confirmed that New Relic ingested your Snowflake metrics, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Dashboards**</DNT> to see your Snowflake dashboards.
