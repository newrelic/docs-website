You can see your critical Snowflake data in New Relic after installing the [Snowflake quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/snowflake).

1. Go to <DoNotTranslate>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Metrics & events**</DoNotTranslate>.

2. Run either NRQL queries to view your Snowflake metrics:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM SnowflakeAccount
  ``` 
  or
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM SnowflakeVirtualWarehouse
  ``` 
3. Once you've confirmed that New Relic ingested your Snowflake metrics, go to <DoNotTranslate>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Dashboards**</DoNotTranslate> to see your Snowflake dashboards.
