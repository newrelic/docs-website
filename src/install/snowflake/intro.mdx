Our Snowflake integration lets you collect query performance data. You can also collect data on the health of your storage systems and warehouses. The integration then presents this data in a set of pre-built <InlinePopover type="dashboards"/> so you can view your most important query data in one place.

<Callout variant="tip">
  This integration falls under the <DNT>**Community project**</DNT> designation in our [Open Source categories](https://opensource.newrelic.com/oss-category). The community provides input through issues and PRs to develop this code openly. There is an active maintainer team within New Relic, as well as troubleshooting support in the New Relic Explorers Hub and documentation available in the project repository.
