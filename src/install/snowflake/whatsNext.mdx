## Configuration options [#config-options]

You can send your own custom metrics to New Relic and view that data in a dashboard. Check out these two examples of custom queries.

<CollapserGroup>
    <Collapser
        className="freq-link"
        id="longest"
        title="Longest queries"
    >
    To find the queries that take the longest to load:

    1. Create a file and name it `longest_queries.sql`.
    2. Designate the file path as `newrelic-snowflake-integrations/queries`.
    3. Add this snippet to the `longest_queries.sql` file:

    ```sql
    select 
        query_id, 
        query_text,
        (execution_time / 60000) as exec_time,
        warehouse_name,
        user_name,
        execution_status
    from 
        snowflake.account_usage.query_history 
    where 
        execution_status = 'SUCCESS' 
    order by 
        execution_time desc
    ```
    4. Add this snippet to the `flex-snowflake-linux.yml` file:
    
      ```yml
        - name: longestQueries
        entity: snowflake
        # New Relic will capture all your Snowflake metrics when you use `event_type: SnowflakeVirtualWarehouse`. 
        event_type: SnowflakeVirtualWarehouse
        custom_attributes:
            metric_type: snowflake.query_performance
        commands: 
            - run: YOUR_PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_BINARY_FILE YOUR_PATH_TO_CLONED_REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY/config.yaml YOUR_PATH_TO_CLONED_REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY/queries/longest_queries.sql
      ```
    </Collapser>
    <Collapser
        className="freq-link"
        id="warehouse-usage"
        title="Credit usage by warehouse"
    >
    To find the queries that take the longest to load:

    1. Create a file and name it `credit_usage_by_warehouse.sql`.
    2. Designate the file path as `YOUR_PATH_TO_CLONED_REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY/queries/credit_usage_by_warehouse.sql`.
    3. Add this snippet to the `credit_usage_by_warehouse.sql` file:

        ```sql
        select 
            warehouse_name, 
            sum(credits_used) as total_credits_used 
        from 
            snowflake.account_usage.warehouse_metering_history 
        group by 
            1 
        order by 
            2 desc;
        ```
    4. Add this snippet to the `flex-snowflake.yml` file:

    ```yml
        - name: CreditUsageByWarehouse
            entity: snowflake
            event_type: SnowflakeVirtualWarehouse
            custom_attributes:
                metric_type: snowflake.credit_usage_by_warehouse
            commands: 
            - run: YOUR_PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_BINARY_FILE YOUR_PATH_TO_CLONED_REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY/config.yaml YOUR_PATH_TO_CLONED_REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY/queries/credit_usage_by_warehouse.sql
    ``` 
    </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>
