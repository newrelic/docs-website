## Configuration options [#config-options]

You can send your own custom metrics to New Relic and view that data in a dashboard. Check out these two examples of custom queries.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="longest"
    title="Longest queries"
  >
    To find the queries that take the longest to load:

    1. Create a file and name it `longest_queries.sql`.

    2. Designate the file path as `newrelic-snowflake-integrations/queries`.

    3. Add this snippet to the `longest_queries.sql` file:

       ```sql
       SELECT 
           query_id, 
           query_text,
           (execution_time / 60000) AS exec_time,
           warehouse_name,
           user_name,
           execution_status
       FROM 
           snowflake.account_usage.query_history 
       WHERE 
           execution_status = 'SUCCESS' 
       ORDER BY 
           execution_time DESC;
       ```

    4. Add this snippet to the `flex-snowflake-linux.yml` file:

       ```yml
       - name: longestQueries
         entity: snowflake
         # New Relic will capture all your Snowflake metrics when you use `event_type: SnowflakeVirtualWarehouse`.
         event_type: SnowflakeVirtualWarehouse
         custom_attributes:
           metric_type: snowflake.query_performance
         commands:
           - run: YOUR_PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_BINARY_FILE YOUR_PATH_TO_CLONED_REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY/config.yaml YOUR_PATH_TO_CLONED_REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY/queries/longest_queries.sql
       ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="warehouse-usage"
    title="Credit usage by warehouse"
  >
    To find the queries that take the longest to load:

    1. Create a file and name it `credit_usage_by_warehouse.sql`.

    2. Designate the file path as `YOUR_PATH_TO_CLONED_REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY/queries/credit_usage_by_warehouse.sql`.

    3. Add this snippet to the `credit_usage_by_warehouse.sql` file:

       ```sql
       SELECT 
           warehouse_name, 
           sum(credits_used) AS total_credits_used 
       FROM 
           snowflake.account_usage.warehouse_metering_history 
       GROUP BY 
           1 
       ORDER BY 
           2 DESC;
       ```

    4. Add this snippet to the `flex-snowflake.yml` file:

       ```yml
       - name: CreditUsageByWarehouse
         entity: snowflake
         event_type: SnowflakeVirtualWarehouse
         custom_attributes:
           metric_type: snowflake.credit_usage_by_warehouse
         commands:
           - run: YOUR_PATH_TO_DOWNLOADED_BINARY_FILE YOUR_PATH_TO_CLONED_REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY/config.yaml YOUR_PATH_TO_CLONED_REPOSITORY_DIRECTORY/queries/credit_usage_by_warehouse.sql
       ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>
