headingText: Install the infrastructure agent

To use the Snowflake integration, you need to also [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent-new-relic/) on the same host. The agent collects data from Snowflake and sends it to New Relic. There, you can use dashboards to track your Snowflake storage performance.
