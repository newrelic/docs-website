headingText: Create your New Relic directory
---

In your app’s directory structure, create a new directory for the New Relic files you downloaded. We recommend putting your files into `/opt/newrelic`.

If you put them elsewhere, make sure the New Relic `.jar`  files, aren’t on the classpath or in directories listed in `java.endorsed.dirs`.
