New Relic supports the most popular Java app servers, frameworks, virtual machines, and tools. Once installed, the APM agent monitors your app's performance and gives you insight into that performance. Want more context? See our [intro to APM](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-apm).

To get the most out of this page, select your app deployment and framework. The instructions change based on your selection. You need a [New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup) to finish the installation process.
