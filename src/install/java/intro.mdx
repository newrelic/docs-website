New Relic supports the most popular Java app servers, frameworks, virtual machines, and tools. Once installed, the APM agent monitors your app's performance and gives you insight into that performance. You can use this doc to get started manually, or you can install the Java agent through the [New Relic UI](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace/install-data-source?state=f91bc85d-0574-6e23-b90a-4d89c7c12866).

To get the most out of this page, select your app deployment and framework. You need a [New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup) to finish the installation process. Want more context? See our [intro to APM](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-apm), or learn how to solve your app's performance issues with our [My app is slow tutorial](/docs/journey-app-slow/root-causes/).
