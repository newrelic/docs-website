New Relic supports the most popular Java app servers, frameworks, virtual machines, and tools. Once installed, the APM agent monitors your app's performance and gives you insight into that performance. Want more context? See our [intro to APM](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-apm).

Use the New Relic Java agent to solve your app's performance issues with our [My app is slow tutorial](/docs/journey-app-slow/root-causes/).
