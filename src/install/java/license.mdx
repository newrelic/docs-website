In order to finish installing the APM agent, you need a valid New Relic license key.

Go to the [API keys page](https://one.newrelic.com/api-keys) in the UI and click **Create a key**, and then create an ingest-license key type. Alternately, if you have an existing license key, click **...**, then click **Copy key ID**.

If you don't already have a New Relic account, [sign up](https://newrelic.com/signup?via=login) to get your license key. It's free, forever!

If you'd like to read more about how we use APIs and API keys, see [New Relic API keys](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys).
