When using the config file, we recommend you: 
  * change the default `newrelic.yml` permissions to read/write only for the owner â€¨of the application server process.
  * make sure `newrelic.yml` is part of your backup routine.
  * use the [New Relic Diagnostics CLI](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-solutions/solve-common-issues/diagnostics-cli-nrdiag/run-diagnostics-cli-nrdiag/) to validate your settings, either before or after you deploy.
