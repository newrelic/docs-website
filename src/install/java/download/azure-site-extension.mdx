This extension is designed for Java applications running on Azure Windows compute resources. To get started:

* Ensure you have your [New Relic license key](https://one.newrelic.com/api-keys) available prior to starting the installation.
* Ensure that you've stopped the target application prior to installing the extension.

## Install the Azure Site Extension [#install-azure-site-extension]

1. From the Azure Home page, click the App Services tile, then select the target application in the displayed list.
1. Scroll down to <DNT>**Extensions**</DNT> in the options listed on the left under the <DNT>**Development Tools**</DNT> category.
1. Click on <DNT>**+ Add**</DNT> at the top of the page to toggle the extension drop down, then select <DNT>**New Relic Java Agent**</DNT>. Check the box for accepting the legal terms
1. Confirm by selecting <DNT>**OK**</DNT> where needed to begin installation. 

Once installed, the extension creates the following artifacts:

* A folder that contains the Java agent artifacts (like jars and sources): `C:\home\NewRelic\JavaAgent\newrelic`
* Microsoft Xml Document Transformation (XDT) that adds the necessary  `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` environment variable on application startup: `applicationHost.xdt` 

If the extension fails to install, a log file is created at `C:\home\SiteExtensions\NewRelic.Azure.WebSites.Extension.JavaAgent\install.log`.

## Configure the extension [#configure-azure-extension]

1. On the options listed on the left, scroll to <DNT>**Configuration**</DNT> located under the <DNT>**Settings**</DNT> category.
2. From <DNT>**Configuration**</DNT>, add the following app settings:

    * `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` with the New Relic license key value
    * `NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME` with the name that will appear in the New Relic platform

You can also add any additional [app settings](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file/#Environment_Variables) to configure the agent as needed.
