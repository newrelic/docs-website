We offer in-depth performance monitoring for your serverless [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) functions. 

<Callout variant="tip">
The AWS Lambda monitoring feature is not the same as the [Lambda monitoring integration](/docs/integrations/amazon-integrations/aws-integrations-list/aws-lambda-monitoring-integration), which only uses CloudWatch data. Serverless Lambda monitoring is more extensive and uses both CloudWatch data and code-level instrumentation to deliver more in-depth monitoring.

We recommend you use our [interactive lambda installation steps in the UI](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?state=65b52603-2aba-a812-5142-3c2977c1ffcd). 

Alternately, see our [manual Lambda installation overview](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/enable-aws-lambda-monitoring) or our [legacy Lambda manual instrumentation steps](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/enable-serverless-monitoring-aws-lambda-legacy#java).
