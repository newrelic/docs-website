### Set up the installation directory [#install-directory]

You can unzip the `newrelic-java.zip` file wherever it is convenient for you. In the subsequent sections we assume you extracted it in the current working directory, which puts the files we need in `./newrelic`.

### Modify your startup scripts [#docker-script]

The startup script that contains the command to start your application server must include Java's built-in argument `-javaagent`. We recommend that you set this argument with the `JAVA_OPTS` environment variable. The value of that argument must contain the location where you `ADD` the Java APM agent's jar file to the image.

For example, with Tomcat, use commands like these in the `Dockerfile`:

```
RUN mkdir -p /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic
ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.jar /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar
ENV JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -javaagent:/usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.jar"
ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.yml /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.yml
```

### Set agent configurations [#agent-configs]

By default, agent behavior is controlled by configuration entries in `newrelic.yml`, which is typically located in the same directory as the agent. This section explains how to override these `newrelic.yml` configurations by using environment variables or Java system properties in the `Dockerfile`.

Before we look at some specific configurations, hereâ€™s how to load `newrelic.yml` using the `Dockerfile`:

```
ADD ./newrelic/newrelic.yml /usr/local/tomcat/newrelic/newrelic.yml
```
