headingText: (Optional) Recommended alert policies and dashboards

After deploying this integration, you can add:

* A default set of recommended alerts conditions and dashboards that you can add to your account. These conditions are grouped into these policies:

    * <DNT>**Kubernetes**</DNT>: To add the default set of recommended alert conditions and a dashboard.
    
    * <DNT>**Google Kubernetes Engine**</DNT>: To add the default set of recommended Google Kubernetes engine alert conditions and a dashboard.

  Once added, you can customize the [alert conditions](/docs/alerts/create-alert/create-alert-condition/alert-conditions/) to meet your needs. See [Recommended alert policies](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/recommended-alert-policies) for more information about managing them.
