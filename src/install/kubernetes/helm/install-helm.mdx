New Relic has many Helm charts for the different components, each with its own set of features for the platform. You can install these components separately, but we really recommend using the [`nri-bundle`](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nri-bundle) chart. New Relic provides this chart, which works as a wrapper or a meta-package containing the individual charts.

To install `nri-bundle` with Helm follow these steps:

1. Make sure `kubectl` is installed and configured correctly to manage the cluster.

2. Use this command to add the New Relic Helm charts repo:

   ```shell
   helm repo add newrelic https://helm-charts.newrelic.com
   ```

3. Create a file named [`values-newrelic.yaml`](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/blob/master/charts/nri-bundle/values.yaml), which will be used to define your configuration:

   ```yaml
   global:
       licenseKey: _YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY_
       cluster: _K8S_CLUSTER_NAME_

   newrelic-infrastructure:
       enabled: true
   newrelic-prometheus-agent:
       # Automatically scrape prometheus metrics for annotated services in the cluster
       # Collecting prometheus metrics for large clusters might impact data usage significantly
       enabled: true
   nri-metadata-injection:
       # Deploy our webhook to link APM and Kubernetes entities
       enabled: true
   nri-kube-events:
       # Report Kubernetes events
       enabled: true
   newrelic-logging:
       # Report logs for containers running in the cluster
       enabled: true
   kube-state-metrics:
       # Deploy kube-state-metrics in the cluster.
       # Set this to true unless it is already deployed.
       enabled: true
   ```

   <Callout variant="important">
     All the options you can include in the YAML file are in the [`nri-bundle`](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nri-bundle) chart.
   </Callout>

4. Make sure everything is configured properly in the chart by running the following command. Notice that we're specifying `--dry-run` and `--debug`, so nothing will be installed in this step:

   ```shell
   helm upgrade --install newrelic-bundle newrelic/nri-bundle \
   --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \
   -f values-newrelic.yaml \
   --dry-run \
   --debug
   ```

   Please notice and adjust the following flags:

   * `global.licenseKey=YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY`: Must be set to a valid <InlinePopover type="licenseKey"/> for your account.

   * `global.cluster=K8S_CLUSTER_NAME`: Used to identify the cluster in the New Relic UI, so should be a descriptive value not used by any other Kubernetes cluster configured in your New Relic account.

   * `kube-state-metrics.enabled=true`: Set this to `true` to automatically install Kube State Metrics (KSM). This is required for our integration to run. You can set this to false if KSM is already present in your cluster, even if it's on a different namespace.

   * `newrelic-prometheus-agent.enabled=true`: Set this to deploy our Prometheus Agent, which automatically collects data from Prometheus endpoints present in the cluster.

   * `nri-metadata-injection.enabled=true`: Set this to install our minimal webhook, which adds environment variables that, in turn, allows [linking applications instrumented with New Relic APM to Kubernetes](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/link-your-applications/link-your-applications-kubernetes).

   * Optional: `newrelic-infrastructure.windowsEnabled=true`: Set this if you want to enable Windows node monitoring.

   * Optional: `newrelic-logging.windowsEnabled=true`: Set this if you want to enable logging for Windows nodes.

   Our Kubernetes charts have a comprehensive set of flags and settings that you can edit to better meet your specific needs. Please, check our [Helm chart](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nri-bundle#readme) to see all the options you have.

5. Install the Kubernetes integration by running the command without `--debug` and `--dry-run`:

   ```shell
   helm upgrade --install newrelic-bundle newrelic/nri-bundle \
   --namespace newrelic --create-namespace \
   -f values-newrelic.yaml
   ```

6. Run this command to check that pods are deploying and reaching a stable state:

   ```shell
   kubectl -n newrelic get pods -w
   ```

7. If you're going to instrument a GKE AutoPilot cluster, your Helm command should include the following:

   ```yaml
   --set newrelic-infrastructure.controlPlane.enabled=false \
   --set newrelic-infrastructure.kubelet.config.scheme=http \
   --set newrelic-infrastructure.kubelet.config.port=10255 \
   ```

   [Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/) can use a FileStore volume to prevent data loss or duplicated logs during Fluent Bit pod restarts or redeploys.  Google FileStore API needs to be enabled in your GKE project. Check this [document](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158841) to know more about enabling APIs.

   To use FileStore, add the following:

   ```yaml
   --set newrelic-logging.fluentBit.persistence.mode=persistentVolume
   --set newrelic-logging.fluentBit.persistence.persistentVolume.storageClass=standard-rwx
   ```

   <Callout variant="important">
     The use of FileStore will result in additional costs, as charged by Google. See your Google Cloud Admin or the [FileStore](https://cloud.google.com/filestore/pricing) doc for more info.
   </Callout>

   If you don't want to use FileStore, add the following:

   * Set `"newrelic-logging.fluentBit.persistence.mode"` to `"none"`
   * Remove `"newrelic-logging.fluentBit.persistence.persistentVolume.storageClass"`


### Windows nodes (preview) [#windows-guided]

If you want to enable Windows nodes monitoring, your Helm command should include the following:

   ```yaml
   --set newrelic-infrastructure.enableWindows=true \
   --set newrelic-logging.enableWindows=true \
   ```
