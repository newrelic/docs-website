This step allows you to forward your Kubernetes logs to New Relic using our plugin. We recommend the default setup, as it's what most users will need.

Select one of these options:

  * **Forward all logs with full enrichment**: It associates all Kubernetes metadata with each log record. This option will increase your ingested data and your cost.

  * **Forward all logs with minimal enrichment (low data mode)**: It sets the `NR_CLI_LOW_DATA_MODE` to true. This is the default option for reducing the amount of data ingested. See [Reduce data ingested by setting `global.lowDataMode`](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/reduce-ingest/#reduce-data-ingest) for more info.

    If you're [using a Kubernetes secret](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/blob/master/charts/newrelic-logging/values.yaml#L8-L25) to store the New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" />, the `newrelic-logging` chart defaults to sending logs to the US API endpoint. If the license key belongs to an EU or FedRAMP account, and a secret is used for key storage, you must update the endpoint setting with the appropriate value from the [API reference docs](/docs/logs/log-api/introduction-log-api/#endpoint). Here's an example of how to set this for EU accounts:

    ```yml
        newrelic-logging:
            enabled: true
            endpoint: https://log-api.eu.newrelic.com/log/v1
    ```
</Callout>

At the end, you'll have the command that you need to copy and paste into a terminal.
