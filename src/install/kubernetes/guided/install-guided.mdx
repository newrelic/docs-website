The guided install is the easiest and simplest way to install the integration while also providing the most control. It also offers a quickstart option that includes some optional, pre-built resources such as dashboards and alerts alongside the Kubernetes integration so that you can gain instant visibility into your Kubernetes clusters.

To open the guided install, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/) > Integrations & Agents**</DNT> and click the <DNT>**Guided install**</DNT> tile. Then select <DNT>**Kubernetes**</DNT>.

Choose one of these instrumentation methods:

* **Guided**: It automates your installation by running a simple script.
* **Helm**: A Helm chart values file with pre-populated required parameters.
* **Manifest**: A manifest YAML file with pre-populated required parameters.
