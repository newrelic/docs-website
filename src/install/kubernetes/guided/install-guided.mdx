headingText: Install the Kubernetes integration
---

The guided install is the easiest and simplest way to install the integration while also providing the most control. It also offers a quickstart option that includes some optional, pre-built resources such as dashboards and alerts alongside the Kubernetes integration so that you can gain instant visibility into your Kubernetes clusters.

From the guided install, you can choose from one of these instrumentation methods:

* **Guided**: It automates your installation by running a simple script.
* **Helm**: A Helm chart values file with pre-populated required parameters.
* **Manifest**: A manifest yaml file with pre-populated required parameters.

Whichever option you choose, you'll go through several steps. Fill in the fields that apply to you. Follow the instructions on each screen. At the end, you'll have the command that you need to copy and paste into a terminal.
