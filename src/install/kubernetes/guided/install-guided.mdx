headingText: Install the Kubernetes integration
---

The guided install is the easiest and simplest way to install the integration while also providing the most control. It also offers a quickstart option that includes some optional, pre-built resources such as dashboards and alerts alongside the Kubernetes integration so that you can gain instant visibility into your Kubernetes clusters.

To open the guided install, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/) > Integrations & Agents**</DNT> and click the <DNT>**Guided install**</DNT> tile. Then select <DNT>**Kubernetes**</DNT>.

Choose one of these instrumentation methods:

* **Guided**: It automates your installation by running a simple script.
* **Helm**: A Helm chart values file with pre-populated required parameters.
* **Manifest**: A manifest yaml file with pre-populated required parameters.

Whichever option you choose, you'll go through several steps. Fill in the fields that apply to you. Follow the instructions on each screen. At the end, you'll have the command that you need to copy and paste into a terminal.

### Windows nodes (preview) [#windows-guided]

Go to the "Configure the Kubernetes integration" installation step, inside the "Windows monitoring" section you will need to enroll the **Windows Nodes Monitoring** preview.
Once joined, you will need to restart the installation flow.
The same section will present the option to automatically update the installation command.
