Our Cassandra integration sends performance [metrics](#metrics) and [inventory data](#inventory) from your Cassandra database to the New Relic platform. You can view pre-built dashboards of your Cassandra metric data, create alert policies, and create your own custom queries and charts.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Instrument your Cassandra database quickly and send your telemetry data with guided install. Our guided install uses our infrastructure agent and our CLI to set up the Cassandra integration, and discovers other applications and log sources running in your environment and then recommends which ones you should instrument. The guided install works with most setups. But if it doesn't suit your needs, there are other install options below.

For a more permanent and scalable solution, we recommend the standard manual install of the agent: keep reading for how to do that.
