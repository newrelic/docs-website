GitHub monitors the health of webhook integrations. If you do not see a green checkmark next to the webhook in the GitHub Webhook UI, investigate the source of the error.

To confirm the integration is running, use this NRQL query to view operational events:

```
FROM Log SELECT * WHERE source = 'GitHub Dependabot' AND issueType IS NULL SINCE 1 day ago
```
