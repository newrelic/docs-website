headingText: Upload new vulnerabilities through the Dependabot Webhook Integration
---

## Prerequisites

- A New Relic [license key](/docs/accounts-partnerships/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key) for the account you want to report data to.
- Organization/Repository administration access to your GitHub account(s)
    - Organization webhooks are strongly recommended. It’s much easier to administer a single webhook per org than to create separate rules for each repository.

## Create the webhook

To create the webhook:

1. From your GitHub organization or repository main page, select **Settings** then select **Webhooks** in the left nav and finally **Add webhook** in the top right of the page.
2. Set the following options:
    - Set **Payload URL** to `https://security-ingest-processor.service.newrelic.com/v1/security/webhooks/dependabot?Api-Key=<NewRelicIngestKey>`
    - Set **Content Type** to `application/json`
    - Leave **Secret** blank
    - Set **Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?** To ‘Let me select individual events`.
3. Select **Repository vulnerability alerts** in the list of events.
4. Click **Add webhook**

Confirm you see a green check mark by the new webhook.

Whenever Dependabot finds a new vulnerability, it will forward it to New Relic through the new webhook. You can find your new data in Logs, the vulnerability management views, and by querying your data.


## Bulk import previously detected vulnerabilitie (Optional)

Once you've created your webhook, we recommend importing previously detected vulnerabilities from your security tools to ensure data integrity. 

Bulk import is initiated with an HTTP POST request. Your GitHub PAT is stored in-memory during import and then discarded. It is never persisted to non-volatile storage.

<Callout variant="caution">
Running bulk import more than once is not recommended. New Relic will remove duplicate imported data in our vulnerability management UI, but queries to the underlying log data will show duplicate data.
</Callout>

A bulk import HTTP POST request consists of the following. Replace `<NewRelicIngestKey>`, `<GithubPAT>`, and `<OrganizationName>` with the appropriate values:

### Post:

```
https://security-ingest-processor.service.newrelic.com/v1/security/import/dependabot
```

### HEADERS

`Api-Key`: your New Relic license key

`Content-Type`: `application/json`


### BODY:
```
{
  "serviceApiKey": "<GithubPAT>",
  "serviceParams": {
    "orgName":"<OrganizationName>",
    "repositories": ["<RepositoryName1","RepositoryName2"] \\ optional
  }
}
```

Example CURL command:

```
curl --location --request POST 'https://security-ingest-processor.service.newrelic.com/v1/security/import/dependabot' \
--header 'Api-Key: <NewRelicIngestKey>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "serviceApiKey": "<GithubPAT>",
    "serviceParams": {
        "orgName":"<OrganizationName>"
    }
}'
```

### Confirming bulk import activity

When you POST to the v1/security/import/dependabot endpoint, the HTTP response will include a request UUID. For example:

```
{"success":false,"errorMessage":null,"uuid":"4740e3c8-dbc4-46e6-a4b2-a7fb6f918d20"}
```

The request GUID is included in all `Log` data written to NRDB from the import job. These events are written in real time as the import job runs. To view the status and output of an import as it runs, use this NRQL query (replacing `YOUR_UUID` with the UUID returned from your HTTP POST):

```
FROM Log SELECT * WHERE source = 'GitHub Dependabot' AND requestId = 'YOUR_UUID'
```
