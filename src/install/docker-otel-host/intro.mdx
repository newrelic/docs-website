Monitor your Docker containers using the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib) to send metrics and telemetry data to New Relic.

This integration leverages the OpenTelemetry [dockerstatsreceiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/dockerstatsreceiver) to monitor your Docker container performance metrics, resource usage, and health.
