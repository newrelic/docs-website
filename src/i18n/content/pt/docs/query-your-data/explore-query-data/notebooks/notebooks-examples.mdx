### Estrutura

**Markdown block: Incident overview**

```markdown
# Production API Outage - October 15, 2024

**Incident Start**: 2024-10-15 14:32 UTC
**Incident End**: 2024-10-15 15:18 UTC
**Duration**: 46 minutes
**Impact**: 15% of API requests failed

## Summary
Our main API experienced elevated error rates starting at 14:32 UTC...
```

**Query block: Error rate timeline**

```sql
SELECT count(*) as 'Total Requests',
       filter(count(*), WHERE httpResponseCode >= 400) as 'Errors'
FROM Transaction
WHERE appName = 'api-production'
TIMESERIES 1 minute
SINCE '2024-10-15 14:00:00' UNTIL '2024-10-15 16:00:00'
```

**Query block: Error breakdown by endpoint**

```sql
SELECT count(*) as 'Error Count',
       average(duration) as 'Avg Duration (ms)'
FROM Transaction

FACET request.uri
SINCE '2024-10-15 14:00:00' UNTIL '2024-10-15 16:00:00'
ORDER BY count(*) DESC
```

**Markdown block: Root cause analysis**

```markdown
## Root Cause Analysis

### Timeline of Events
- **14:32**: Error rates began climbing for `/api/users` endpoint
- **14:35**: Database connection pool exhaustion detected
- **14:45**: Database scaling initiated
- **15:18**: Service fully recovered

### Contributing Factors
1. Unusual traffic spike during product launch
2. Database connection pool too small for peak load
3. Missing rate limiting on user registration endpoint
```

**Query block: Database performance during incident**

## Best practices for notebook examples

### Structure your story

1. **Start with context**: Always begin with a Markdown block explaining the purpose
2. **Follow logical flow**: Arrange queries in the order someone would naturally investigate
3. **Provide conclusions**: End with Markdown blocks summarizing findings and next steps

### Make queries reusable

* Use variables for dates, application names, and thresholds
* Comment your NRQL to explain complex logic
* Choose appropriate time ranges for the analysis type

### Visual design tips

* Use consistent chart types throughout related queries
* Choose colors that support your narrative
* Add clear titles and labels to all visualizations
* Use tables for detailed data, charts for trends and patterns
