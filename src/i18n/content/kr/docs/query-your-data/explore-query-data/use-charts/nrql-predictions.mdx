## 개요 [#purpose]

<DNT>**NRQL Predictions**</DNT> in New Relic uses your metric&amp;apos;s historical data patterns to predict future trends, providing insights into how metrics might behave in the future. This proactive approach helps you visualize trends and anticipate potential issues, enabling timely interventions to maintain optimal system performance. This feature currently supports predictions for both seasonal (data that has a recurring, repeatable pattern on a set cadence) and non-seasonal time series. Metrics that exhibit a strong trend or defined seasonal pattern are best suited for NRQL predictions. These predictions are best utilized when added to existing dashboards to give a quick visual indicator as to where your metrics are headed.

Examples of situations where you might want to add a prediction to your chart:

* Your application is producing more logs over the past few hours and the disk space is running out.
* Your application is steadily running out of memory, threatening to crash the entire container.
* You need to project future revenue based upon observed seasonal and trend patterns.

While <DNT>**NRQL Predictions**</DNT> themselves do not identify potential issues, they equip you with the information you need to assess trends and plan for future challenges. To generate alerts when the predictions indicate an impending problem, you can enroll for the <DNT>**[Predictive Alerts](/docs/alerts/create-alert/set-thresholds/predictive-alerts)**</DNT> feature, currently available in public preview. <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> works alongside <DNT>**NRQL Predictions**</DNT> to generate predictions for your metrics and alert when those predictions pass a static threshold.

## 가격 [#pricing]

Your use of <DNT>**NRQL Predictions**</DNT> is billable during preview in accordance with your Order as applicable to the pricing model associated with your Account. New Relic Query Language queries related to use of this feature are billable as the Core Compute Product. If this feature becomes generally available, your use will be billable in accordance with your Order.

    Predictions can only be added to charts that depict time series, such as a line or area chart. To add a prediction to an existing chart, follow these steps:

    <Steps>
      <Step>
        #### 라인 또는 영역 차트에 액세스 [#access-a-chart]

        1. [one.newrelic.com &gt; All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) 으로 이동하세요.
        2. To add a prediction to a line or area chart, select it from <DNT>**Dashboards**</DNT>, or open it from <DNT>**Metrics and events**</DNT>.
      </Step>

      <Step>
        #### Add a prediction [#add-prediction]

        To add a prediction, from the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal" /> menu, select <DNT>**Predict trend**</DNT>. In **Data Explorer**, the prediction appears on the chart. The prediction range is automatically set to 20% of the query window. To indicate where the prediction is on the chart, the area is highlighted in gray and the predicted values are connected by a dashed line.

        The `PREDICT` clause is appended to the query and generates a prediction using the [NRQL predictions default behavior](#defaults). You can [refine the query](#customize-prediction-range) by fine-tuning according to your requirements and re-run it to get the updated predictions.

        <Callout variant="note">
          When you add a prediction to an area chart, it changes to a line chart containing the prediction.
        </Callout>
      </Step>

    The NRQL syntax includes the `PREDICT` clause to streamline the use of NRQL predictions. For usage details and examples, refer to [the NRQL syntax documentation](/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions).

    Example of using `PREDICT` in a NRQL query:

    ```sql
    FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE error IS TRUE TIMESERIES PREDICT
    ```

## 기본 동작 [#defaults]

Currently, <DNT>**NRQL predictions**</DNT> only supports the <DNT>**[Holt-Winters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing#Triple_exponential_smoothing_\(Holt_Winters\))**</DNT> algorithm, also known as exponential smoothing, for both seasonal and non-seasonal time series. This is a commonly used and standard algorithm for forecasting and prediction tasks. We support hourly, daily, and weekly seasonal lengths for the Holt-Winters model.

In general, the default behavior should be sufficient for the majority of NRQL prediction use cases.

쿼리의 `PREDICT` 절에는 다음과 같은 기본 동작이 적용됩니다.

* **Seasonality**: Automatically detects whether seasonality is present in the historic data. If seasonality is detected, the identified season length is used in the Holt-Winters seasonal algorithm. If no seasonality is found, it constructs a non-seasonal model.
* **Hyperparameters**: Sets the hyperparameters for the Holt-Winters algorithm based upon the seasonality and historical data.
* **Prediction window**: Predicts a range equal to 20% of the total time span specified in your query window.
* **학습용 이력 데이터**: 현재 쿼리 창과 이전 두 창의 이력 데이터를 사용하여 예측을 생성합니다.
* **시간 간격**: 데이터 투영의 일관성을 보장하기 위해 쿼리 창에서 시계열의 데이터 포인트 간격에 맞춥니다.

## Customizing the predictive model [#customize-prediction-range]

You can customize the predictions by manually setting the training model&apos;s hyperparameters and adding the `USING` and `BY` keywords. To learn more about NRQL and its syntax, refer to [NRQL documentation](/docs/nrql/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language). Generally, the only hyperparameter most users will want to adjust will be the seasonality. The algorithm will perform best when a known seasonality (or known non-seasonality) is specified by the user. The other hyperparameters for the Holt-Winters algorithm are accessible and changeable, but default values are determined based on the historical data for your metric.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser id="hyperparameters" title="Set seasonality and Holt-Winters model hyperparameters.">
    Currently, <DNT>**Holt-Winters**</DNT> is the only supported prediction algorithm and there are several hyperparameters that can be adjusted to fine-tune your predictions. The hyperparameters can be modified by adding `holtwinters(<hyperparameter>: <value>)` after the `PREDICT` clause in your query. Any combination of the following parameters can be added to modify the result of the predictions:

    * `seasonality` Specifies whether you want to use a known season length, automatic seasonality detection, or no seasonality (`<season length>`, `AUTO`, `NONE`).
      * `<season length>` must be an `integer unit` of time (i.e., `1 day` or `3 hours`)
    * `alpha` The level smoothing factor (`[0, 1.0]`) where a larger value gives more weight to recent values
    * `beta` The trend smoothing factor (`[0, 1.0]`) where a larger value gives more weight to recent values
    * `gamma` The season smoothing factor (`[0, 1.0]`) where a larger value gives more weight to recent values
      * Not compatible with the `seasonality: NONE` option because a non-seasonal model does not use the `gamma` hyperparameter. The query will return an error if you try to specify `holtwinters(seasonality: NONE, gamma: <value>)`
    * `phi` The trend damping parameter (`[0.98, 1.0]`) where a smaller values indicates more damping of the trend and a prediction that will flatten out

    Example query with hyperparameter modifications:

    ```sql
    FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE error IS TRUE TIMESERIES PREDICT holtwinters(seasonality: 1 hour, alpha: 0.2, beta: 0.5, gamma: 1.5, phi: 0.99)
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="by"
    title={<><InlineCode>
      BY
    </InlineCode> 키워드를 추가합니다.</>
    }
  >
    Use the `BY` keyword to set how far ahead in time you want the model to predict. For example, `PREDICT BY 3 hours` generates a prediction up to three hours into the future from the latest point in the time series. Make sure the time span is an `integer unit` of time. The maximum amount you can predict is 360 time windows (i.e., your time series window size times 360).

    Example query with `BY` keyword that will generate predictions for the next 30 minutes:

    ```sql
    FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE error IS TRUE TIMESERIES PREDICT BY 30 minutes
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="using"
    title={<><InlineCode>
      USING
    </InlineCode> 키워드를 추가합니다.</>
    }
  >
    Use the `USING` keyword to specify the amount of historical data you want to use to train the model. For example, `PREDICT USING 1 day` uses the query window along with the data from the preceding day to train the model. Make sure the time span is an `integer unit` of time. There is a limit to how much data can be used to train a model and if you specify an amount that exceeds the limit, you will receive an error message. This limit is 3,660 data points and you can figure out how much time that is by using the time series window. So for example, if you are querying a time series with a 1 minute time window, you will only be able to specify an amount of training data of up to 3,660 minutes, which is 61 hours or approximately 2.5 days.

    Example query with the `USING` keyword that will use 2 days of historical data:

    ```sql
    FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE error IS TRUE TIMESERIES PREDICT USING 2 days
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

Example query with the `PREDICT` clause specifying custom hyperparameters, and adding the `BY` and `USING` keywords:

```sql
FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE error IS TRUE TIMESERIES PREDICT holtwinters(seasonality: AUTO, alpha: 0.2) BY 1 hour USING 2 hours
```
