metaDescription: Here are some tips for understanding the OpenTelemetry logs page in the New Relic UI.
---

After you've sent us your OpenTelemetry data and opened your service (entity) in the UI, you can click on **Logs** to see data about your application. For more information about how to associate log data to your application in New Relic, see our [OpenTelemetry and logging documentation](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-logs).

For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following:

* `service.name`
* To correlate with trace data, the logs should contain the `trace.id` and `span.id` attributes.

To learn about OpenTelemetry in other UI pages, see the [UI overview](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/view-your-data/opentelemetry-view-your-data).
