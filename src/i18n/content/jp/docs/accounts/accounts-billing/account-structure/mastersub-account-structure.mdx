metaDescription: How New Relic master/sub-account structure works.
---

Some New Relic accounts are able to create a more complex account structure with master accounts and sub-accounts.

<Callout variant="important">
  Access to this feature depends on your subscription level.
</Callout>

## Master and sub-account hierarchy [#hierarchy]

Each sub-account is attached to a single master account and can have multiple apps reporting to it. The master account may also have applications reporting to it, but not all data sent from sub-account applications rolls-up into the master account data.

To switch between accounts in the UI, see [Account access](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/factors-affecting-access-features-data#account-access).

To understand how sub-accounts and master accounts scale with EU region accounts, see [EU region account hierarchy](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/introduction-eu-region-data-center#global-account-hierarchy).

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you have a partnership account structure, see [Partnership accounts](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/partner-account-maintenance/partnership-accounts-users-subscriptions).

  Master accounts can have their own apps reporting data. However, an app reporting to a sub-account may not report data to a master account.

## License keys for sub-accounts [#keys]

Your main New Relic account serves as the master account with its own [license key](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/license-key). Each sub-account has their own individual license keys (and their own [API keys](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/rest-api-key)). Each application can use only one license key, so each application can report to only one account.

## Create sub-accounts [#creating]

**Requirements:**

* Pro or Enterprise pricing tier.
* Your must be on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models) (if you're on our [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models), you need assistance from New Relic).

If you're able to create sub-accounts, you can do that with these instructions:

1. Go to: **[account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary**.
2. From **Sub-accounts**, select **Add account**.
3. Type the sub-account name, then select **Add this account**.
4. Continue with the procedures to add sub-account users.

If any sub-accounts have already been created, the first account on the **Sub-accounts** list is the master account. To manage a sub-account, select its name.

## Set up accounts with SAML SSO [#saml]

If you [set up SAML SSO](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/saml-single-sign/setting-sso) at the master account level, your sub-account users will also be able to sign in using SSO. For more information, see [Configuring SAML with multiple accounts](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/saml-single-sign/configuring-saml-multiple-accounts).

<Callout variant="important">
  If you do not set SAML SSO at the master level, you can set it at the sub-account level. However, **do not** set SAML SSO at both levels.
</Callout>

## Add sub-account users [#users]

**Requirements:**

* Pro or Enterprise pricing tier.
* Your must be on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models) (if you're on our [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models), you need assistance from New Relic).

In general, permissions for a user on a master account are automatically inherited for that user on sub-accounts. However, in order to receive alert notifications or weekly email reports, or to hide specific applications from a sub-account, they must be explicitly added to the sub-account.

When the Owner first adds a sub-account, the Users list is automatically populated with the admin who created the sub-account. To add, edit, or delete individuals for the sub-account later, go to the sub-account's **Summary,** or start from the master account's **Summary**:

1. Go to: **[account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown) > Account settings > Account > Summary**.
2. From the master account's **Sub-accounts** list, select the sub-account's link.
3. From the sub-account's **Active users** section, select **Add user**, fill in the user's email, name, role, and title as appropriate, and then select **Add this user**.
4. Optional: [Change the Owner or Admin roles](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/adding-updating-users) for the sub-account as appropriate.

## Update sub-account applications [#subaccount_apps]

**Requirements:**

* Pro or Enterprise pricing tier.
* Your must be on our [original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models) (if you're on our [New Relic One user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model#user-models), you need assistance from New Relic).
* Must be Owner or Admin.

When you change the app's config file to move it from one account to another, New Relic treats it as a new app in the new sub-account. New Relic does not move any historical data for the app.

To install a new app for your sub-account:

1. Make sure you have selected the master account: From the [account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown), select **Switch account > (master account)**.
2. Follow standard procedures to install new applications.

   OR

   Change the license key in the existing application's configuration file to move it to another sub-account.

## Update sub-account email settings [#subaccount_emails]

Anyone who uses the sub-account can update their own settings for alert notifications or weekly emails for the sub-account's applications:

1. Go to: **[account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown) > Switch account > (select a sub-account)**.
2. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](http://one.newrelic.com) > APM**.
3. From the sub-account's [**Applications** index](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/viewing-your-applications-index), select the app's gear <Icon name="fe-settings"/>
   icon, then select **Manage alert policy**.
