metaDescription: Here are some tips for understanding the OpenTelemetry transactions page in the New Relic UI.
---

After you've sent us your OpenTelemetry data and opened your service (entity) in the UI, click on **Transactions** to identify slow or error transactions that might be causing a spike in your application's response time. To get a list of transactions, go to the **Transaction Summary** page, and then select the transactions table.

New Relic's notion of a [transaction](/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/transactions-new-relic-apm#txn-defined) encapsulates one logical unit of work in a software application - generally, this is work performed by a single process.

With OpenTelemetry, we rely on [`SpanKind`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/trace/api.md#spankind) for mapping trace data to New Relic's concept of a transaction. A `SpanKind` of `server` or `consumer` is used to identify the entry point of a process - that is, these are spans that are either root spans or child spans of a remote process.

For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        UI area
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Top Transactions
      </td>

      <td>
        * `span.kind = server` or `consumer`
        * Facets by span name
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Throughput
      </td>

      <td>
        * `span.kind = server` or `consumer`
        * Facets by span name
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
