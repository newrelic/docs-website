After you send OpenTelemetry data to New Relic, you can use a variety of UI pages to analyze it. Take a look at these options:

* Standard UI pages (similar to APM pages): See the links in the left navigation pane for details about each page and how to ensure your data appears in them.
* [Errors inbox:](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-view-your-data/opentelemetry-errors-inbox-page) See how to triage error groups.
* [Data explorer and query builder:](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-view-your-data/opentelemetry-data-explorer-query-builder) Use these do-it-yourself tools to dig into your data.
