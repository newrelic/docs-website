---

After you've sent us your OpenTelemetry data and opened your service (entity) in the UI, you can click on **External services** to view calls to out-of-process services such as web services, resources in the cloud, and other network entities.

For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following:

* `span.kind = client` or `producer`
* `db.system` is not present

For more details, see [External services](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/external-services/external-services-intro).
