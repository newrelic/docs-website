metaDescription: Here are some tips for understanding the OpenTelemetry JVMs page in the New Relic UI.
---

After you've sent us your OpenTelemetry data and opened your service (entity) in the UI, you can click **JVMs** to identify which service instances instrumented with OpenTelemetry have unusual or unhealthy performance patterns. You can choose several service instances to compare based on summaries of key metrics: response time, throughput, error rate, garbage collection time, and memory usage. Then, you can compare all those instances' JVM metrics collected by OpenTelemetry instrumentation using timeseries charts to spot problems.

Here's a typical workflow:

1. Click **JVMs**.
2. Find interesting JVMs using the table of summarized health metrics:
   * Use the filter bar to narrow down your search.
   * Sort to find outliers.
3. Select those interesting JVMs.
4. Click **Compare** to see a display of the health and runtime metrics faceted by JVM.

    When you drill into a specific JVM, the UI display charts driven by JVM metric data. The Java specific runtime metrics are not well documented. The [implementation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/tree/main/instrumentation/runtime-metrics/library/src/main/java/io/opentelemetry/instrumentation/runtimemetrics) is effectively the documentation and may be subject to change.

    For your data to appear in this section, make sure it has the following:

    * A unique `service.instance.id` attribute for rendering the list of JVMs.
    * An OpenTelemetry resource attribute `service.instance.id`.

  Starting in OpenTelemetry Java agent 1.10.0, JVM memory usage switched from being collected as an async gauge to an async up down counter. This has implications on the exported data. Gauges and counters export differently:

    * Async gauges export as OTLP gauges.

    * Async up down counters export as OTLP non-monotonic sums.

  If you configure your SDK to export your metrics using delta aggregation temporality (which is required for counter and histogram instruments to function with New Relic), that results in async up down counters exported as non-monotonic delta sums. New Relic can't perform any useful analysis of non-monotonic delta sum data.

  The solution for now (until a better solution is sorted out in the OpenTelemetry metric specification) is to use the View API to indicate that async up down counters should be aggregated using [last value aggregation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/sdk.md#last-value-aggregation) instead of the default sum aggregation. This results in JVM memory usage being exported as gauge data, which is required for a useful experience in New Relic.

  The way you configure the View API varies based on whether you’re using the OpenTelemetry Java agent:

    * If you're not using the OpenTelemetry Java agent, review this simple [example](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples/pull/89/files#diff-da355ef6d1092534a55829e95160ab8468884bdd521f9018feeaaa66aea6ac5bR82-R86) that shows how to register a view when configuring `SdkMeterProvider`.

    * If you’re using the OpenTelemetry Java agent, you need to configure the View API in an [extension](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/blob/main/docs/agent-config.md#extensions). Extensions allow you to hook into the SDK configuration (among other things) and apply programmatic configuration that isn’t available by environment variable or system properties. This [example](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples/tree/main/java/agent-nr-config) demonstrates how you can use an extension to [customize](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-opentelemetry-examples/blob/main/java/agent-nr-config/config-extension/src/main/java/com/newrelic/otel/extension/Customizer.java#L28-L37) the `SdkMeterProvider`’s views.
