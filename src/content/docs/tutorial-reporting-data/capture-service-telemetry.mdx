Think about what your service does. Perhaps it receives an order, needs to validate the order for integrity, conveys that order to a clearinghouse service, and receives a confirmation code that's relayed back to the requestor. This example gives a clear path to break down the function of service and evaluate if you have enough telemetry and context to make decisions on how the service is functioning. If you are using New Relic's agents, you should have all the information you need to answer the questions at the beginning of this section. However, sometimes specific implementations require additional instrumentation.

The following list of questions helps you find where you might need to add telemetry or metadata capture through instrumentation. The [improvement process](#improvement-process) section that follows describes how to get the data needed to manage your service.

Considerations for instrumentation:

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Are my base telemetry requirements satisfied?
      </td>

      <td>
        If not, document the gaps and evaluate if they can be closed through custom configuration or additional instrumentation techniques.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Can I isolate discrete user stories within the telemetry?
      </td>

      <td>
        If not, use trace capabilities of agents to capture the invocation of a discrete user story with adequate context metadata.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Do I have insight into the parameters that are invoking user stories?
      </td>

      <td>
        If not, use custom attributes through agent SDKs to add context to the transactions and spans.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Can I measure the major functional components of the software?
      </td>

      <td>
        If not, use instrumentation SDKs to create baseline metrics on a specific functional element of the code. (cache lookups, processing routines, or utility functions).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Can I measure the client interactions from my code to external systems?
      </td>

      <td>
        If not, ensure requests and responses are captured by component level tracking. If the client invocation is not in synch, consider implementing distributed trace features to correctly view the processing.
      </td>

    ## Determine your instrumentation needs [#instrumentation-needs]

    First, you'll need to determine specifically what you need to do. Every service fulfilling a business need should have enough instrumentation to answer the following questions, and now is a good time to sew which ones you can and can't answer so you can know what areas you need to focus on.

    * How many requests do I receive?
    * How many messages and HTTP requests do I send?
    * How many requests are successful?
    * What is the response time for a full request?
    * What is the response time for invocation to a dependency?
    * How much resource should this process take under what number of requests?
    * What are all my points of failure?  

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Configure your instrumentation [#config-based-instrumentation]

    Next, it's time to begin configuring your instrumentation. Each New Relic agent provides a variety of configuration options. Typically you'll define a standard approach to include the agents within infrastructure hosts, application runtimes, and connections to your cloud service providers. Default agent configurations have been created to be widely applicable.

    One of the best ways for developers to influence the applicability of deployment is by overriding the default configuration options for your service instance. The following are default instrumentation options to consider:

    <CollapserGroup>
      <Collapser
        id="service-naming"
        title="Create an effective service name"
      >
        <Callout variant="tip">
          New Relic agents provide a variety of options to define the service runtime name. See the [application naming guide](/docs/new-relic-solutions/best-practices-guides/full-stack-observability/apm-best-practices-guide/#1-standardize-application-names-naming) to find the implementation details for your runtime environment.
        </Callout>

        The name you give a service provides the <DNT>**namespace**</DNT> (where you will find the agent data). One of the most important strategies New Relic uses to understand the behavior of your services is to aggregate simliar things together and use the commonalities from this aggregation to isolate variance. When deploying services, ask the following to help you name them:

        * Does my service target a specific audience?
        * Is my service running a different codebase?
        * Is my codebase using a different runtime configuration?

        If you answer “yes” to any of these questions, consider creating a unique name for your service based on the following:

        <CollapserGroup>
          <Collapser
            id="audience-criteria"
            title="Audience criteria"
          >
            Think of the audience as the group of end users or service functions. If your service is split between North American and European deployments, the runtimes in those deployments should be grouped accordingly. For example:

            ```
            newrelic.appname = PORTAL_AMER
            ```

            and

            ```
            newrelic.appname = PORTAL_EMEA
            ```

            This will group the telemetry created by that audience together, allowing you to better understand the contextual similarities of service problems related to a specific user audience.

            Sometimes the way we deploy applications divides the operational context of a service, such as a portal application with administrative functions. Maybe the admin functions are baked into the general portal codebase, but only one instance in a cluster is handling the portal admin requests. In that case you have a functional audience segmentation opportunity, so you should ensure that it is named appropriately. For example:

            ```
            newrelic.appname = PORTAL_MAIN
            ```

            and

            ```
            newrelic.appname = PORTAL_ADMIN
            ```
          </Collapser>

          <Collapser
            id="codebase-criteria"
            title="Codebase criteria"
          >
            If you're running different code versions under the guise of one service, consider segmenting those runtime instances and incorporating version naming as part of your naming scheme. When you group code together as one service name that is executing different service versions, you're increasing the noise-to-signal ratio of any metrics you produce.

            Different code versions might use different amounts of compute resource or process data differently. It becomes very difficult to determine if a service is behaving normally when the signals you get from the metrics are due to different functional implementations.

            If you have multiple versions running concurrently, consider adding a numeric identifier to the service name. For example:

            ```
            newrelic.appname = PORTAL_MAIN_V112
            ```

            and

            ```
            newrelic.appname = PORTAL_MAIN_V115
            ```

            If you employ feature flag frameworks like LaunchDarkly or Split, you may have multiple versions of an application or service within a single codebase. To address those conditions, please consult the section on isolating service functions.
          </Collapser>

          <Collapser
            id="runtime-criteria"
            title="Runtime criteria"
          >
            If an instance of a service is deployed to a system with different runtime constraints, it should be encapsulated in its own telemetry namespace. This can be a deployment to a different data center that offers network connectivity advantages to a shared resource, or perhaps the service is running on a separate compute tier with a different memory or thread configuration.

            These characteristics that affect the code runtime operation can cause different behaviors that lead to different operations behaviors. For example:

            ```
            newrelic.appname = PORTAL_NYC_DC
            ```

            and

            ```
            newrelic.appname = PORTAL_REALLY_BIG_FOOTPRINT
            ```
          </Collapser>
        </CollapserGroup>
      </Collapser>
    </CollapserGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Override default agent configuration [#override-default-agent-config]

    <Callout variant="tip">
      The New Relic agents provide a variety of options for runtime configuration. Please refer to the [APM agent config docs](/docs/new-relic-one/install-configure/configure-new-relic-agents) for the options specific to your runtime.
    </Callout>

    Each New Relic APM agent provides a variety of options to modify the default configuration. The most consistent location we do this is the configuration file that accompanies each agent install. However, you can also configure our agents by passing command line parameters directly to the service instance runtime, by using environment variables, or by calling functions within the agent's SDK at runtime.

    Here are the .NET agent configuration options:

    * [Using the New Relic .NET SDK API](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/net-agent-api/)
    * [Environment variables](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration/#environment-variables)
    * [Config file options](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration/#setup)  

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Isolate service functions [#isolate-service-functions]

    As the [Create an effective service name](#service-naming) section indicated, one of the primary objectives of instrumentation is to configure the New Relic agent to group similar runtime constraints together as a single named unit. For a specific set of inputs, you should get an expected range of measurable outcomes. The degree to which we can comfortably contain these into named service runtime components greatly helps us understand normal behavior and isolate issues.

    The New Relic agent is configured with a set of assumptions that create namespaces for transactions as they're detected. Those assumptions differ between the agent language runtime. A good example of how our Java agent determines the transaction name can be found in the [Java agent's transaction naming doc](/docs/apm/agents/java-agent/instrumentation/transaction-naming-protocol/).

    However, even after you've applied the agent transaction naming protocol, it may give you an unsatisfactory result depending on your needs. By adding additional instrumentation to name the transaction and improve its context, you can greatly improve your understanding of the service's execution behavior.

    <img
      src="/images/oma-oe-sc_screenshot-full_transaction-breakdown.webp"
      alt="Transaction Breakdown"
      title="Transaction Breakdown"
    />

    The goal for transaction naming should be a view of APM transactions that provides good segmentation of the services functions in an approach that's easy to understand for a non-developer. The transaction breakdown image above is a good example of transaction segmentation. It provides detailed tracking of the amount of work being done by each transaction within the broader codebase of the service as well as the transaction with a plain user-friendly name that offers insight into what the transaction does. As you learn more about naming transactions and including attributes, be sure to make your naming approach accessible for non-technical observers of the data.

    <img
      src="/images/oma-oe-sc-transaction-breakdown-weighted.webp"
      alt="Transaction Breakdown Weighted"
      title="Transaction Breakdown Weighted"
    />

    The transaction breakdown in the image above demonstrates a bad example of transaction name segmentation. In this case, you'd have about 60% of the transaction volume being named `OperationHandler/handle`. Both the percentage attribution of the transaction volume and the generic nature of the name indicate there might be too much aggregation of transactions underneath that namespace.

    Your objective is to create a transaction name that facilitates grouping transactions with the fewest unique characteristics, such as below.

    <img
      src="/images/oma-oe-sc_screenshot-full_transaction-breakdown-histogram-normal.webp"
      alt="Transaction Histogram"
      title="Transaction Histogram"
    />

    The normal distribution image demonstrates more purposefully named transactions within a service. In this case, the web transaction response times are more closely grouped, indicating consistent execution characteristics.  

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Define custom transaction names [#custom-transaction-names]

    <Callout variant="tip">
      Consult the API guide for your [New Relic agent](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-apm) to review the transaction naming procedure for your runtime.
    </Callout>

    The New Relic agent transaction naming service requires the invocation of a `SetName(String name)`-like API call to the New Relic agent SDK. Each language runtime agent has its own syntax and option for setting the name. See the example below if you need more information:

    <CollapserGroup>
      <Collapser
        id="transaction-example"
        title="Example"
      >
        To take the value of an HTTP request parameter and use it to name a transaction in the New Relic Java agent, you can use code similar to this:

        ```
        com.newrelic.agent.Agent.LOG.finer("[my query handler] Renaming transaction based on an important query parameter");

        com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic.setTransactionName("Query Handler_" + (javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest)_servletrequest_0).getParameter("important_query_parm"));
        ```
      </Collapser>
    </CollapserGroup>

    There is a maximum capacity for transaction names. When too many transaction names are being reported, we'll attempt to create rules to group those transaction names. More details can be found in the [agent troubleshooting guide](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/troubleshooting/metric-grouping-issues) related to metric grouping issues. Your transaction naming strategy will have to trade off a degree of specificity if there are thousands of potential transaction names.

    Should you suspect a metric grouping issue, open a support case with us and we'll be happy to work with you to isolate the cause of the transaction naming issue.  

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Capture parameters with your transactions [#capture-parameters]

    <Callout variant="tip">
      Consult the [New Relic agent custom attributes guide](/docs/using-new-relic/data/customize-data/collect-custom-attributes/) for your agent language to review the metadata enhancement options for attribute customization.
    </Callout>

    The transaction name is a powerful way for you to segment your service so that you can better understand its behavior. It allows you to discretely isolate functionality directly in the New Relic UI.

    However, there are many occasions when you'll want to get some additional context on the function of your service without resorting to isolating the transaction name. This can be accomplished by introducing attribute capture by your service.

    You can add `name:value` pair attributes to decorate the details of each transaction. The attributes will be available in each transaction event through the APM transaction trace and errors UI, or through direct query of parameters from the `Transaction` event type. Here's an example of the transaction trace details you can see in the APM errors UI.

    <img
      src="/images/oma-oe-sc_screenshot-crop_error-attributes.webp"
      alt="Error Attributes"
      title="Error Attributes"
    />

    If you've developed a useful transaction name segmentation, you can use the added context of the attributes to better understand the inputs, cohorts, or segments that led to an unexpected result.

    In addition to being able to understand the context of your transaction within the APM UI, using parameters are useful for analyzing transactions by querying transaction data directly. Add custom attributes to each transaction to make it easy to isolate specific conditions.

    The parameter capture approach can also be used with feature flag systems like Split or LaunchDarkly. In this case, as you're implementing the decision handler for the feature flag, consider capturing the flag context (for example, `optimized_version = on`) that's being applied to the block of code controlling the version or feature the customer sees.

    For example, to take the value of an HTTP request parameter and save it as a custom attribute with the New Relic Java agent, you can use code similar to this:

    ```
    com.newrelic.agent.Agent.LOG.finer("[my query handler] Adding an Attribute to transaction based on an important query parameter");

    com.newrelic.api.agent.NewRelic.addCustomParameter("ImportantParm", (javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest)_servletrequest_0).getParameter("important_query_parm"));
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Measure service components [#component-measurement]

    The behavior of a specific transaction within the context of a service is a powerful way to ensure a software system is operating effectively. However, another way to look at the behavior of a software system is to review the detailed component execution model of its implementation. The application framework code components are shared throughout the service, and the ongoing evaluation of component performance can provide an insight into the overall service health.

    In New Relic, there are two places you can observe component execution details. The service summary dashboard in APM provides a view of the composite execution of the service broken down by its component parts (for example, garbage collection execution or database calls).

    <img
      src="/images/oma-oe-sc_screenshot-full_summary-components.webp"
      alt="Summary Components"
      title="Summary Components"
    />

    Transaction component segments tend to demonstrate consistent performance behavior. You can use this to detect a change in fundamental behavior. This can indicate an underlying issue. This allows you to find dependencies through the common parts in the code running within a service.  

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Ensure your frameworks are measured [#framework-measurement]

    <Callout variant="tip">
      To find information about adding metric names to your instrumentation, consult the instrumentation and SDK guides for a specific APM agent.
    </Callout>

    The syntax for framework instrumentation is specific to the language your service is written in, but the general approach is consistent across them all. Each method or function execution on the stack is an opportunity to add additional instrumentation.

    <img
      src="/images/oma-oe-sc_screenshot-full_summary-client.webp"
      alt="Service Summary Components"
      title="Service Summary Components"
    />

    If a particular segment of logic is required for the function of your service or transaction, consider wrapping that call with callbacks to the New Relic agent so that the agent can understand that it has entered a discrete code component and can aggregate the time consumed within that component accordingly. By passing a metric name to the callback, you will create a component segment metric for your service and transaction.

    The metric naming option is specific to the instrumentation language, so be sure to consult the specific language documentation.

    Our agents allow you to specify a custom metric name for the instrumentation. We use `metricName` to determine the aggregated metric for the component. The following example demonstrates the `metricName` parameter being passed to a Java agent SDK `@Trace` annotation.

    <CollapserGroup>
      <Collapser
        id="metric-code-example"

        @Weave
        public abstract class MQOutboundMessageContext implements OutboundTransportMessageContext {

            @Trace(dispatcher = true, metricName="MQTransport")
            public void send(final TransportSendListener listener) throws TransportException {
                try {
                    NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod().setMetricName("Message", "MQ", "Produce");
                    MQHelper.processSendMessage(this, NewRelic.getAgent().getTracedMethod());
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    NewRelic.getAgent().getLogger().log(Level.FINE, e, "Unable to set metadata on outgoing MQ message");
                }

                Weaver.callOriginal();
            }

        }

  <Step>
    ## Track your external service calls [#external-services]

    <Callout variant="tip">
      To find the details of client library instrumentation, consult the instrumentation and SDK guides for the relevant APM agent.
    </Callout>

    Client instrumentation refers to making a call from your service to an external resource. Generally, New Relic agents are aware of clients popular for HTTP, gRPC, messaging, and database protocols and will apply the appropriate instrumentation pattern to aggregate calls to those clients as external services.

    If you have written your own client handler for a protocol, or are using something very new, our agent may not recognize the client and record the behavior of the client call. To this end you should verify the external services and databases within APM to represent all expected externalities for your service.

    It's important to validate that all your services' dependencies are represented here. If you don't see your service dependencies, you'll need to introduce new instrumentation to intercept the external call so that your APM agent can track it. The following example demonstrates wrapping an external call in Golang for capture by the agent.

    <CollapserGroup>
      <Collapser
        id="external-service-example"
        title="Example"

        	"github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/newrelic"
        )

        func currentTransaction() *newrelic.Transaction {
        	return nil
        }

        func main() {
        	txn := currentTransaction()
        	client := &http.Client{}
        	request, _ := http.NewRequest("GET", "http://www.example.com", nil)
        	segment := newrelic.StartExternalSegment(txn, request)
        	response, _ := client.Do(request)
        	segment.Response = response
        	segment.End()
        }

    ## Test your endpoints [#endpoint-testing]

    <CollapserGroup>
      <Collapser
        id="endpoint-testing2"
        title="Understand endpoint testing"
      >
        Before you begin, make sure you understand the concept of endpoint testing. Endpoint testing is a simple and practical approach that speeds up the finding of root causes of given system failures. It allows operations and supporting teams to quickly know there is a real problem, and isolate that problem to a specific service.

        Modern software systems depend on a number of services to complete their tasks. Historically, the process of monitoring those service endpoints was straightforward. The architecture team would produce a well documented map of dependencies for the operations team and create a check of the itemized endpoints.

        Today, with continuous delivery processes and small batch changes, you can create new endpoints and dependencies and deploy them at a rate that makes it difficult for an operations team to anticipate and proactively define synthetic checks. By giving the service developers greater scope of control to define production service tests during the development phase, you'll greatly increase the coverage of testing for your observability program.
      </Collapser>
    </CollapserGroup>

    Endpoint testing provides two benefits to your service instrumentation program:

    * <DNT>**Defect detection:**</DNT> By encoding a test for an endpoint that produces a simple true/false result, your operations can isolate discrete failures to determine if the integrity of service delivery has been compromised.
    * <DNT>**Baselining:**</DNT> Synthetic or machine tests provide a predictable set of conditions that allow you to evaluate the consistency of your service delivery from a control perspective.

    Our synthetic monitoring offers the ability to create a variety of testing types by employing an enhanced Selenium JavaScript SDK. Once a Selenium-based test script has been defined, we'll manage the location of the script execution as well as its frequency. The synthetic test offers a variety of test options, each with its own focus. For more information see our [synthetic monitoring documentation](/docs/synthetics/).

    First, you'll need to create a decision matrix for synthetic checks. Knowing whether or not you need to create a synthetic check is straightforward. You'll want to know the first occurrence of a failure for a dependency. If you answer “yes” to any of the following questions, consider creating a dedicated synthetic check:

    * Is the endpoint customer-facing?
    * Does the endpoint invoke new dependencies?
    * Is the endpoint on a different network infrastructure?
    * Is the endpoint shared between multiple services?
    * Is the endpoint a content origin supported by a CDN?

    You should then consider implementing the simplest possible test to evaluate endpoint availability and integrity. For example, you have just created a new Service endpoint that provides the current exchange rate for a group of currencies. This is a simple GET at an endpoint that returns a JSON object array.

    * Request example:  `http://example-ip:3000/exchange`
    * Response example:

    ```

    In order for this service to be considered operational, it needs to respond to requests but also provide the four currency responses. We're not worried about the content at the moment, just the fact we get four elements back in the array one, for each CDN, USD, EUR and MEX currencies.

    Using New Relic synthetic monitoring, an API test script could look like the following:

    ```
      /**
      * This script checks to see if we get the currency data from the endpoint.
      */
      var assert = require('assert');
      var myQueryKey = 'secret_key';
      var options = {
        uri: 'http://example_ip:3000/exchange',
        headers: {
          'X-Query-Key': myQueryKey,
          'Accept': 'application/json'
        }
      };

      function callback (err, response, body){
        var data = JSON.parse(body);
        var info = body;
        if (Array.isArray(data)) {
          if (data.length !== 4) {
            assert.fail('Unexpected results in API Call, result was ' + JSON.stringify(data));
          }
        }
      }

      $http.get(options, callback);
    ```

    You can directly configure the synthetics script in the New Relic interface, but we highly recommend you maintain your endpoint tests within your source repository system and employ automation. This ensures your endpoint testing accompanies the new endpoint dependencies that your services introduce to production service delivery.

## Realizing the value [#value-realization]

Like the process of monitoring services, your observability program will benefit through a dedicated team function that thinks critically about its expectations of return for its investment in effort. The following section outlines an approach for estimating the costs and benefits you should expect by incorporating service instrumentation into your observability practice.

### Investments [#investments]

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="inv-training"
    title="Training"
  >
    Ensure all developers are familiar with New Relic agent SDKs and platform capabilities.

    **Cost model:** Dependent on your company's developer FTE model and project estimation.
    **Estimation:** Typically a number of hours for a developer to become effective using New Relic instrumentation features.
        * Initial: 16 hours training and exploration
        * Recurring: 4 hours/Q review
        * Per developer a yearly investment of 16 to 40 hours training to develop core skills and maintain skills currency for New Relic platform

    The development effort required to implement and maintain instrumentation within a service project.

    **Cost model:** Dependent on your company's developer FTE model and project estimation.
    **Estimation:** This tends to be dependent on the scope of the project and the amount of instrumentation work required.
        * Initial: 8 hours per developer per service
        * Recurring: 4 hours/Q maintenance
        * Per developer a project estimation of 16 to 32 hours developing and maintaining service instrumentation

    Our doc on [alert quality](/docs/tutorial-create-alerts/manage-alert-quality/) delivers significant benefit to the operations team by ensuring the alert notifications from variant system performance are dealt with swiftly. This improves service delivery and resource allocation during incident remediation.

    An effective instrumentation practice federated into your observability program will greatly improve your team's ability to create meaningful alerts.

    <DNT>
      **KPIs:**
    </DNT>

    * Volume: incident count
    * Volume: accumulated incident duration
    * Volume: mean-time-to-close (MTTC)
    * User engagement: mean time to investigate

    <DNT>
      **Outcomes:**
    </DNT>

    * Less alert noise
    * Greater alert and incident responsiveness
    * Less unknown root cause
    * Increased operations productivity
    * Improved service delivery

    Improving your service quality will have a direct impact on the key financial metrics for your service. This will require that you have a well rationalized financial model for your application. Typically this return can be projected by associating a currency value for each percent improvement on a core service quality measure like errors or apdex attainment.

    As your investment in service instrumentation increases, you should see improved attainment on your service quality measures.

    <DNT>**KPI:**</DNT> Service quality (business KPI)

    <DNT>
      **Outcomes:**
    </DNT>

    * Decreased number of user impacting errors
    * More performant and resilient service components

    By providing better telemetry from your service instances, your delivery organization should be able to more quickly detect volatility or downtime and remediate faster. This will lead to better overall service delivery KPIs and decrease episodes of outage or degradation.

    Cost can be associated with the amount of time it takes to detect, investigate and remediate an incident. This might be related to the value the Service provides your organization that will be lost during an event, or may be related to the general cost to deal with the poorly behaving Service.

    <DNT>
      **KPIs:**
    </DNT>

    * Mean time to detect (MTTD)
    * Mean time to identify (MTTI)
    * Mean time to resolution (MTTR)

    <DNT>
      **Outcomes:**
    </DNT>

    * Decreased time to detect incidents
    * Decreased time to resolve incidents
