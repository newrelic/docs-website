You can integrate New Relic with [Lighthouse](http://lighthouseapp.com). This is useful to create tickets about performance issues in New Relic APM's [transaction traces](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/introduction-transaction-traces) and [error analytics](/docs/apm/applications-menu/error-analytics/error-analytics-explore-events-behind-errors).

## Requirements

New Relic sends information to the ticketing system with webhooks. Make sure your system accepts traffic from New Relic's [webhook IPs](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/networks#webhooks).

In addition, Lighthouse setup requires:

* The subdomain for your installation; for example, `https://subdomain.lighthouseapp.com`
* Your Lighthouse account's email and password for ticket tracking

## Integrate with New Relic [#procedures]

<Callout variant="tip">
  **Owner and Admins**
</Callout>

To connect your New Relic account to Lighthouse:

1. Go to: **[account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown) > Account settings > Integrations > Ticketing integrations**.
2. Select the tab for Lighthouse.
3. Follow the instructions on the individual tab, then click **Integrate**.

After your ticketing system has been integrated, the corresponding tab's health status indicator in New Relic's UI changes to green (enabled).

## File tickets [#ticket]

To use the ticketing system integrated with your New Relic account:

1. From the selected [APM transaction trace](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/transaction-trace-details) or [APM error trace](/docs/apm/applications-menu/error-analytics/error-analytics-manage-error-traces), select **File a ticket**.
2. Follow standard procedures to create a ticket from your Lighthouse account.
