      </th>

      <th>

      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `nrdiag-output.zip`
      </td>

      <td>
        A flattened folder structure with one or more config files and any existing New Relic logs. Attach this file to your New Relic Account. This archive also contains a copy of `nrdiag-output.json`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `nrdiag-output.json`
      </td>
