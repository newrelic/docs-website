metaDescription: Three output files and status codes used with New Relic Diagnostics (nrdiag).

After executing the Diagnostics CLI from your terminal, you will see the results for each task as they are completed. Tasks that result in a `Warning` or `Failure` status code will log additional details regarding possible issues found during execution, along with troubleshooting suggestions and relevant links to documentation. If you use the `-attach` flag, you will be able to view your results in [New Relic One](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/diagnostics-cli-nrdiag/interpret-nrdiag-output/#diag-in-nr1)

## File output

The Diagnostics CLI outputs three files:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Diagnostics output files
      </th>

      <th>
        Comments
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `nrdiag-output.zip`
      </td>

      <td>
        A flattened folder structure with one or more config files and any existing New Relic logs. Attach this file to your New Relic account. This archive also contains a copy of `nrdiag-output.json`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `nrdiag-output.json`
      </td>

      <td>
        Output of the individual tests. Attach this output to your New Relic account.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `nrdiag-filelist.txt`
      </td>

      <td>
        A list of files found. The `nrdiag-output.zip` file that you attach to your New Relic account automatically includes this list. You do not need to attach this `.txt` file separately.

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The Diagnostics CLI returns the following status codes after running:
