The Diagnostics CLI (`nrdiag`) is a utility that automatically detects common problems with New Relic products. If the Diagnostics CLI detects a problem, it suggests troubleshooting steps. The Diagnostics CLI can also automatically attach troubleshooting data to a New Relic Support ticket.

The Diagnostics CLI is open source and is located in [GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-diagnostics-cli).

For additional troubleshooting steps for your agent, check out [Not seeing data](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/not-seeing-data).

![New Relic Diagnostics - Ubuntu Linux](./images/2020-06-03-16.01.42.gif "New Relic Diagnostics - Ubuntu Linux")

Here's an example of the Diagnostics CLI running on Ubuntu Linux. The program checks the configuration of your agents for issues and can generate zipped troubleshooting logs that are ready to be attached to support tickets.

## Compatibility

The Diagnostics CLI is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows. It can detect common configuration issues for:

* **APM**: Available for all APM agents except C SDK. For the Go agent, only basic connectivity checks are available.
* **Browser monitoring**: Browser agent detection
* **Infrastructure monitoring**: Linux and Windows agents
* **Mobile agents**: iOS and Android
* **Synthetics**: CPM

The Diagnostics CLI does not require `superuser` or `admin` permissions to run, although New Relic does recommend those permissions for some checks. It will return an error if it does not have permissions to read the files it scans.

## Run the Diagnostics CLI [#run-diagnostics]

To use the Diagnostics CLI:

1. Review the [release notes](/docs/release-notes/platform-release-notes/diagnostics-release-notes), to make sure you have the latest version.
2. [Download the latest version](https://download.newrelic.com/nrdiag/nrdiag_latest.zip), which contains executable files for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
3. Move the executable for your platform into the [location of your application's root directory](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/find-agent-root-directory).
4. **Recommendation:** Temporarily raise the [logging level](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/new-relic-agent-logs-troubleshooting) for the New Relic agent for more accurate troubleshooting. Note that changing the logging level requires you to restart your application.
5. Run the executable.
   * **Recommendation:** Run with a [task suite](#task-suites) (CLI option) to scope your troubleshooting.

The Diagnostics CLI automatically searches its root directory and subdirectories for agent configuration files and other relevant data. To run the Diagnostics CLI, follow the procedures for your platform:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="linux-run"
    title="Linux"
  >
    1. Ensure you have the Diagnostics CLI:

       * From the command line, change the directory to your application's root directory and ensure that the `nrdiag.zip` file is present.

         OR
       * [Manually download the latest version](https://download.newrelic.com/nrdiag/nrdiag_latest.zip).
    2. Unzip `nrdiag.zip` if necessary.
    3. From the `nrdiag_1.2.3/linux` directory, move `nrdiag` into the application's root directory.
    4. Run `nrdiag` (along with any [CLI options](#cli-options) and/or [a ticket attachment key](#attach-ticket-results)):

       ```
       ./nrdiag CLI_OPTIONS
       ```

    The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it discovers, and uploads relevant files to your New Relic Support ticket if you include a ticket attachment key.

    1. Ensure you have the Diagnostics CLI:

       * From the command line, change directory to the application's root directory, and ensure that the `nrdiag.zip` file is present.

         OR
       * [Manually download the latest version](http://download.newrelic.com/nrdiag/nrdiag_latest.zip).
    2. Unzip `nrdiag.zip` if necessary.
    3. From the `nrdiag_1.2.3/win` directory, move `nrdiag.exe` or `nrdiag_x64.exe` into the application's root directory.
    4. For troubleshooting web applications, ensure you are running the executable from your project's **parent** directory, or specify your config file location with the `-c` option.
    5. Run the executable (along with any [CLI options](#cli-options) or [a ticket attachment key](#attach-ticket-results)) from the directory you placed the binary. Since some checks require elevated permissions, for best results run from an Admin shell.

       Run via PowerShell if you add any `CLI_OPTIONS`:

       ```
       ./nrdiag.exe CLI_OPTIONS
       ```

       **OR**, for x64 systems:

       ```
       ./nrdiag_x64.exe CLI_OPTIONS
       ```

## Suites flag (highly recommended CLI option) [#task-suites]

A suite is a collection of health checks that target specific products or issues. Using a suite can help narrow the scope of troubleshooting and reduce the occurrence of false positives.

### View suites

To review a list of available suites, run the Diagnostics CLI with the `-help suites` option.

```
./nrdiag --help suites
```

### Run suites

Suites are run by providing the `-suites` flag and one or more suite names (for example, `java`) to run as arguments.

      <td>
        To run from PowerShell, add `./` to the start of `cmd`.

        For 32-bit systems:

        ```
        nrdiag.exe --suites SUITE NAMES
        ```

        For 64-bit systems:

</Table>

## View or copy attachment key [#attachment-key]

New Relic Support generates an attachment key for your support ticket, which is used with the Diagnostics CLI. To view or copy your attachment key:

1. Log in to your New Relic account at [**rpm.newrelic.com**](https://rpm.newrelic.com), then select **Help > Get support**.
2. Select **View open tickets**, then select the ticket.
3. Copy the `NR Diagnostics attachment key` that appears at the top of the ticket. If you do not see the attachment key code, notify Support.

Use this attachment key to upload your Diagnostics CLI results to your support ticket.

## Upload results to a support ticket [#attach-ticket-results]

<Callout variant="important">
  If your system is configured to **not** connect to external IP addresses, this method will not work. Instead, attach the [output files](#file-output) in an email to New Relic Support.
</Callout>

### Automatic upload [#automatic]

To upload your results automatically to a New Relic Support ticket when the Diagnostics CLI is executed, use the `-attachment-key` command line flag with your ticket's attachment key.

Uploading your results to a support ticket will automatically upload the contents of `nrdiag-output.zip`. If you would like to inspect or modify the contents of this file before upload, follow the manual upload process.

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

### Manual upload [#manual]

If you modified or inspected the content of `nrdiag-output.zip` and want to attach it to a support ticket, you can use the `-file-upload` and `-attachment-key` command line flags together to upload a specific file:

```
./nrdiag -attachment-key ATTACHMENT_KEY -file-upload ZIP_FILENAME
```

## Pass command line options [#cli-options]

These command line options are available for the Diagnostics CLI:

## Validate your config file settings

The Diagnostics CLI now features more detailed configuration setting validation. Currently the Java agent's `newrelic.yml` file is supported, and support for other agents' configuration files is planned, if you have an urgent need for a specific agent let us know [here](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-diagnostics-cli/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement%2C+needs-triage&template=enhancement.md&title=). If you run `nrdiag` in the usual manner (on the system running your application with the New Relic agent already installed) the new validation will be applied automatically, and any warnings will be shown.

You can also use this feature as a linter to validate a config file before deployment. Do this by running the appropriate task and providing the path to your config file. For example, if your `newrelic.yml` and `nrdiag` are both in the current directory, you can run the following command to lint the config file: `./nrdiag -t Java/Config/ValidateSettings -c newrelic.yml`.

The screenshot below shows an example of the output for an incorrect setting. The `agent_enabled` setting in this case has a value of "yes", but the Java agent only accepts the values "true" or "false" (this misconfiguration will prevent the agent from running).

![Screenshot of a terminal window showing command output. The agent_enabled setting is called out as incorrect.](./images/agent_enabled.png "agent_enabled.png")

When enable your agent incorrectly, you see a message like this describing what setting needs to be updated and how it needs to be changed.

## Interpret the output [#interpret-output]

After executing the Diagnostics CLI from your terminal, you will see the results for each task as they are completed. Tasks that result in a `Warning` or `Failure` status code will log additional details regarding possible issues found during execution, along with troubleshooting suggestions and relevant links to documentation:

![screen-nrdiag-output.png](./images/screen-nrdiag-output_0.png "screen-nrdiag-output.png")

The Diagnostics CLI outputs any issues it found with your installation, along with troubleshooting suggestions.

## File output

The Diagnostics CLI outputs three files:

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Diagnostics output files

  </tbody>
</Table>

## Run the Diagnostics CLI in a Docker container

To troubleshoot your New Relic-instrumented application running in a Docker container you can use the `docker exec` command as follows:

1. [Download](https://download.newrelic.com/nrdiag/nrdiag_latest.zip) and unzip the `nrdiag_latest.zip` file.
2. Copy the binary to the container. Replace `IMAGE_NAME` with the name of your docker container:

   ```
   docker cp nrdiag/linux/nrdiag IMAGE_NAME:/bin
   ```
3. Run the `nrdiag` command in the docker container. Replace `IMAGE_NAME` as above, and replace `APPLICATION_ROOT` with the root directory of your application, where you installed the New Relic agent:

   ```
   docker exec -it -w APPLICATION_ROOT IMAGE_NAME nrdiag
   ```
4. (Optional) Remove the `nrdiag` binary when finished:

   ```
   docker exec IMAGE_NAME rm /bin/nrdiag
   ```

## Licensing and security [#security]

<Callout variant="important">
  The use of the Diagnostics CLI is subject to this [license agreement](/docs/licenses/license-information/other-licenses/new-relic-diagnostics-licenses), as well as licensing agreements for open-source software used by the Diagnostics CLI.
</Callout>

Like any other New Relic tool, the Diagnostics CLI service is designed to protect you and your customers' data privacy. The Diagnostics CLI inspects system information and New Relic product artifacts (logs and config files) that are relevant for performing diagnostic checks that assess New Relic product configuration and operability.

By default, this data is not transmitted to New Relic. You do have the option to upload this information to a support ticket over HTTPS.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="support-tickets"
    title="Data uploaded to support tickets"
  >
    The Diagnostics CLI does allow uploading of this information to a support ticket over HTTPS if you use a specific command-line argument. You will be prompted before the collection of any files that we expect to have sensitive information.

    Before the collected files [contained within `nrdiag-output.zip`](#file-output) are uploaded to New Relic, you will also be prompted. This allows you to review and edit any information that you do not want to provide. (For example, the `nrdiag-output.zip` will include your user name.) You also have the option to cancel the upload altogether.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="data-storage"
    title="Data storage"
  >
    Any support ticket attachments made using NR Diag or containing NR Diag data that are less than or equal to 20MB are stored by Zendesk. Otherwise these attachments are stored by New Relic. For more information, see [Zendesk's privacy and data protection policies](https://www.zendesk.com/company/privacy-and-data-protection/).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="environment-variables"
    title="Environment variables"
  >
    The Diagnostics CLI examines the following environment variables to perform diagnostic checks. The values of these variables are recorded locally in the `nrdiag-output.json` file.

    * Any environment variable containing `NEWRELIC` or `NEW_RELIC`
    * Any environment variable beginning with `NRIA`
    * `PATH`
