Quickstarts are bundles of dashboards, alerts, and instrumentation that are ready to install with a single click, specific to each technology we support. Popular technologies such as Node.js, Python, and Ruby have full-featured quickstarts, while others contain a mixture of instrumentations, dashboards, and alerts.

We thoroughly review external edit to our quickstarts for value and quality. Interested in contributing to the community?
