## Run the New Relic Diagnostics tool [#diagnostics]

[New Relic Diagnostics](/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/troubleshooting/new-relic-diagnostics) is our automated diagnostic tool for Linux, Windows, and Mac. If it detects a problem with any of our agents, it suggests solutions and saves troubleshooting logs that you can attach to tickets.

## Find answers in New Relic Docs and New Relic University [#find-answers]

New Relic's [Docs site](https://docs.newrelic.com/) contains helpful installation, configuration, and troubleshooting tips. From the [main page](http://docs.newrelic.com), select from frequently-used categories and topics, like [release notes](/docs/release-notes). Or, [search from any page](http://docs.newrelic.com/search).
