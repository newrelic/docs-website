## Problem

Depending on the situation, you may find [error traces](/docs/apm/applications-menu/error-analytics/error-analytics-manage-error-traces) in the APM UI that do not include stack traces for your application.

## Solution

Depending on the situation, follow these troubleshooting procedures.

    For performance reasons, we cap error reporting as follows:

    * 100 events per minute per agent instance
    * 20 trace details per minute per agent instance

    Our APM agents automatically report errors for unhandled exceptions. In situations where application logic handles the error, our APM agent may miss the error, and won't report a stack trace.

    You can use the `notice_error()` [agent-specific API](/docs/apm/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/manage-errors-apm-collect-ignore-or-mark-expected/#error-collection) to record handled exceptions.

    If you configured errors to be [ignored](/docs/apm/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/manage-errors-apm-collect-ignore-or-mark-expected/#ignore), the stack trace won't be avilable

    <Collapser
    id="500-errors"
    title="No stack traces for 500 errors"

    Returning a `500` error means that the application server itself detected an error and set the HTTPS `500` status code.

    * If the error condition was detected and handled by application logic, there was no exception object and thus, no stack.
    * If there was an exception object at some point, but it was handled internally by the application code that set the `500` status on the response, then the exception never became visible to the agent. There is no stack available for the agent to report.

    When stack traces are reported, the error results from an exception that was not caught and handled within the application server logic. The agent sees the unhandled exception during a monitored transaction, so it reports the stack trace.

## Agent specific behavior for missing stack traces

### Java Agent

    title="No stack traces for rapidly repeated errors"

    When an error is thrown in a rapidly repeated sequence, the Java compiler may optimize the stack trace away to help performance. To disable this optimization: In your JVM flags, include:

    ```
    -XX:-OmitStackTraceInFastThrow
    ```
