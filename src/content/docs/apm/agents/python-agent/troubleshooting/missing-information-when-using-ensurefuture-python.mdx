## Problem

Detailed function trace information does not appear when using `asyncio.ensure_future` in coroutines.

## Solution

Futures created from `ensure_future` must be awaited in the same coroutine in which they've been created. For example,in the **Before** section, `await` is not present with `ensure_future`, which would result in missing information:

**Before**:

```
import asyncio

async def foo():
  ensure_future(bar())

async def bar():
  await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
```

**After**:

```
import asyncio

async def foo():
  await ensure_future(bar())

async def bar():
  await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
```
