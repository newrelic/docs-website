## Problem

If you have problems [instrumenting browser](/docs/agents/python-agent/supported-features/page-load-timing-python) with the Python agent, follow the [standard troubleshooting procedures](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation-configuration/troubleshooting-browser-monitoring-installation) for browser monitoring. Here are some additional tips for Python.

## Solution

Follow these recommendations to check content structure and verify that content compression is not interfering.

    If you are expecting to see the browser agent added automatically but do not, check whether any of these restrictions might apply.

    * The `Content-Type` for the HTML response must be `text/html`.
    * The `Content-Encoding` response header cannot be set.
    * The `Content-Disposition` response header cannot mark the response as an attachment.
    * The `Content-Disposition` specified in an `http-equiv` meta tag within the HTML`<head>` element cannot mark the response as an attachment.
    * The `<body>` element of the HTML response must appear within the first 64 kbytes.

      If you are generating HTML page responses and using the `Content-Type` of `application/xhtml+xml`, you can override the allowed content types to list both this content type and `text/html` in your agent configuration file.

      ```
      browser_monitoring.content_type = text/html application/xhtml+xml
      ```

      Make sure the `browser_monitoring.content_type`is a space-separated list of content types.

      When adding `application/xhtml+xml` as an allowed content type for automatic instrumentation, be aware that the resulting page will no longer validate correctly as `application/xhtml+xml`, although the page should still be loaded and rendered correctly by browsers.

      To resolve issues with the other content limitations, use [manual instrumentation](/docs/agents/python-agent/supported-features/page-load-timing-python#manual_instrumentation).

    If you are using a WSGI or web framework middleware or a plugin that encodes the response content, such as when doing response compression, automatic instrumentation may not work. The Python agent provides specific support for Django `GZipMiddleware` and `Flask-Compress` with auto-instrumentation. However, currently this is not supported for `paste.gzipper`, because it contains a bug which makes it unusable in conjunction with the agent's WSGI middleware that adds the browser monitoring instrumentation.

    If you encounter this problem, use [manual instrumentation](/docs/agents/python-agent/supported-features/page-load-timing-python#manual_instrumentation), or switch to using your web server or frontend proxy to compress the response content, rather than performing compression within your web application. The latter solution may also offer performance benefits.

  <Collapser

    title="Check page source for conditional blocks."
  >
    When inspecting your page source, you see the browser agent inserted incorrectly inside a conditional block.

    ```
    <!--[if IE]>
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
        <script type="text/javascript">/*Browser agent here*/</script>
    <![endif]-->
    ```

    This can happen because the Python agent does not check for these conditional blocks when deciding to place the browser agent. Consider using [manual instrumentation](/docs/agents/python-agent/supported-features/page-load-timing-python#manual_instrumentation) in this case.
