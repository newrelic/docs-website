After you [install the Python agent package](/docs/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-quick-start) and create a config file, New Relic's Python agent must be integrated with your application. This step allows the agent to capture and report your application's important functions and web requests.

There are two integration methods:

* [Running the admin script via command line](#wrapper-script): We recommend this method because it is easy and doesn't require making changes to your app code.
* [Manual integration](#manual-integration): If you cannot use the admin script method, you can manually initialize the Python agent in your app code.

## Admin script integration method [#wrapper-script]

For a simple explanation of how to use the admin script via the command line, see the [integration section](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-installation#integration) of the advanced install instructions. Here are instructions with more details and context.

The `newrelic-admin` admin script prefixes the command you use to start your WSGI server or web app. This script works by wrapping your startup command and listening for certain function classes used by common frameworks. (To instrument functions and methods that are not instrumented by default, use [custom instrumentation](/docs/agents/python-agent/custom-instrumentation/python-custom-instrumentation).)

Here are examples of running the script:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "175px" }}>
        Old command form
      </th>

      <th>
        New command form
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `YOUR_ORIGINAL_COMMAND_OPTIONS`
      </td>

      <td>
        `NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program YOUR_ORIGINAL_COMMAND_OPTIONS`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `VARIABLE=VALUE YOUR_ORIGINAL_COMMAND_OPTIONS`
      </td>

      <td>
        `NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini VARIABLE=value newrelic-admin run-program YOUR_ORIGINAL_COMMAND_OPTIONS`
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The following examples give instructions for a Bourne-style shell. You may need to adjust these instructions for a different shell.

    If you're using Gunicorn and your startup command is:

    ```
    gunicorn -w 3 wsgi:application
    ```

    Then your new agent-integrated command is:

    ```
    NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program gunicorn -w 3 wsgi:application
    ```

    ```

    Here's an example of running the admin script using paster serve on a WSGI app specified in a paster ini configuration file:

    ```
    newrelic-admin run-program paster serve production.ini
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

For framework-specific documentation on using the admin script, see [Web frameworks and servers](/docs/agents/python-agent/web-frameworks-servers).

Here are some advanced instructions for running the admin script:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="multi-line"
    title="Splitting admin script command across multiple lines"
  >
    You can separately set and export the `NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable before running the script. Ensure you substitute your existing command options for `YOUR_COMMAND_OPTIONS`:

    ```
    NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini
    export NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE

    newrelic-admin run-program <var>YOUR_COMMAND_OPTIONS</var>
    ```

    If your startup command uses `exec`, separate the setting of the environment variable from the execution of the admin script. Ensure you substitute your existing command options for `YOUR_COMMAND_OPTIONS`:

    ```
    NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini
    export NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE

    exec newrelic-admin run-program <var>YOUR_COMMAND_OPTIONS</var>
    ```

    If you use a process management system such as **supervisord** where the environment variables must be set in a separate configuration setting, you cannot set them on the same line as the command.

    For example, under **supervisord** you might use the following. Be sure to substitute your existing command options for `YOUR_COMMAND_OPTIONS`.

    ```
    [program:warpdrive]
    command = newrelic-admin run-program <var>YOUR_COMMAND_OPTIONS</var>
    environment = NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="run-program"
    title="Running admin script with Python executable"
  >
    If the command being run is the `python` executable and it is being run directly on a Python code file as `python main.py`, use either of the following:

    ```
    newrelic-admin run-program python main.py

    newrelic-admin run-python main.py
    ```

    Using `run-python` will always use the same `python` executable as is installed in the Python installation or virtual environment that **newrelic-admin** is installed.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="location-admin"
    title="Notes about the location of newrelic-admin"
  >
    The **newrelic-admin** program you run must be coming from the same Python installation or virtual environment as your application is using. You cannot mix programs/components from different Python installations. If this is done, the agent will not run correctly.

    If you use a process management system such as **supervisord** in a virtual environment, you could use this configuration:

    ```
    [program:warpdrive]
    command = newrelic-admin run-program  
    environment = PATH="/path/to/python/app/venv/bin",NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE="newrelic.ini"
    directory = /path/to/python/app
    user = www-data
    ```

    Note the `PATH` environment variable that points to the same path that would be used by the virtual environment.

    For more information on these options to **newrelic-admin** and the different configuration options based on user environment variables, see the more detailed documentation for the `run-program` and `run-python` options.

## Manual integration in app code [#manual-integration]

If you cannot or do not want to use the recommended [admin script integration](#wrapper-script) method, you must initialize the Python agent manually in your web app code. This process involves importing a Python agent package into your app and making a call to initialize the agent. This call modifies your app's import mechanism so that when libraries are imported, the agent listens for the function classes it recognizes.

For manual integration, add the following to the beginning of the application script file or module that holds your WSGI entry point.

<Callout variant="important">
  Unlike standard Python functionality, the import order matters: the agent package must be imported first.
</Callout>

```
import newrelic.agent
newrelic.agent.<a href="/docs/agents/python-agent/python-agent-api/initialize">initialize</a>('<var>/some/path</var>/newrelic.ini')
<var>... YOUR_OTHER_IMPORTS</var>
```

In this example, <var>/some/path/newrelic.ini</var> represents the location of the copy of the config file created during [Python agent installation](/docs/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-quick-start). The config file must be readable by your web application.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="environment-override"
    title="Admin script with deployment environment overrides"
  >
    To specify an override in the agent config file that corresponds to a specific deployment environment, supply the environment's name as the second argument to the [`initialize()` function](/docs/agents/python-agent/python-agent-api/initialize). If you have installed the Python package into a Python virtual environment, you must add these lines after you have activated or set up **sys.path** to find your virtual environment.

    ```
    import newrelic.agent
    newrelic.agent.initialize('<var>/some/path</var>/newrelic.ini', 'staging')
    ```

    Whenever possible, precede any imports for modules that are going to be instrumented. For some web frameworks, including Flask, this is mandatory. The instrumentation will not work correctly if not placed before all imports that cause code from that framework to be imported.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="manual-override"
    title="Manual configuration with deployment environment overrides"
  >
    If you do not use the admin script but still want to use the environment variables `NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE` and `NEW_RELIC_ENVIRONMENT` to configure the agent, you can call the `initialize()` function with no arguments, and they will be read automatically.

    ```
    import newrelic.agent
    newrelic.agent.initialize()
    ```

    Alternatively, you can set the `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` and `NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME` environment variables if the defaults for all other configuration settings are suitable.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="embedded"
    title="Embedded environment overrides"
  >
    With embedded environments such as Apache/mod_wsgi, in general you cannot rely on being able to derive configuration from environment variables. This is because typically in embedded systems, you cannot set process environment variables which are in turn available to the WSGI script file. For more information, see the documentation for the [initialize()](/docs/python/python-management-api#initialize) function.

## Unsupported web frameworks [#wsgi-application]

If you are using an unsupported web framework or are constructing a WSGI application using a WSGI component library such as Werkzeug or Paste, you may also need to manually wrap the WSGI application entry point. This is in addition to doing one of the main integration methods ([using the admin script](#wrapper-script), or [manually initializing the Python agent](#manual-integration)).

If the WSGI application entry point is a function declared in the file itself, use a decorator:

```
@newrelic.agent.wsgi_application()
def application(environ, start_response):
...
```

If the WSGI application entry point is a function or object imported from a different module, wrap it with a wrapper object:

```
import myapp
application = myapp.WSGIHandler()

application = newrelic.agent.WSGIApplicationWrapper(application)
```

If a supported web framework is being used, you can still use the decorator or wrapper explicitly if, for example, you want to configure additional WSGI middleware around the supported web framework. This will ensure that execution of all WSGI middleware is also covered by the monitoring done by the agent.

For more information, see the documentation for the [wsgi_application()](/docs/python/python-instrumentation-api#wsgi_application) and [WSGIApplicationWrapper](/docs/python/python-instrumentation-api#WSGIApplicationWrapper) wrapper.
