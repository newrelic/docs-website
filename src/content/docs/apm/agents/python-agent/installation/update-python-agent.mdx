To take full advantage of our latest features, enhancements, and important security patches, we recommend you update your Python agent to the latest version. For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the [Python agent release notes](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/python-release-notes).

## Update with Python package index (PyPi) [#package-index]

The Python agent package is listed on PyPi at [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/newrelic "Link opens in new window"). To update with a specific package, follow the corresponding instructions:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={150}>
        **Python package**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Installation procedures**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        pip
      </td>

      <td>
        To update the `newrelic` package directly from PyPi, run:

        ```
        pip install --upgrade newrelic
        ```

        If you have New Relic in your `requirements.txt` file, you can do a mass update of all required packages by running:

        ```
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        easy_install
      </td>

      <td>
        To update using `easy_install`, run:

        ```
        easy_install --upgrade newrelic
        ```

        <Callout variant="tip">
          We recommend using `pip` rather than using `easy_install`, because `pip` will correctly remove old versions when updating the agent software.
        </Callout>
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        buildout
      </td>

      <td>
        Install the package by creating an appropriate section for the `newrelic` package using the `zc.recipe.egg` recipe.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Download package manually [#manual-download]

To manually download the New Relic Python package:

1. Remove the current New Relic package.
2. Download the new package, then follow the [Python agent installation](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-installation#download-site) procedures.

<Callout variant="tip">
  We recommend using `pip` rather than using manual installation, because `pip` will correctly remove old versions when updating the agent software.
</Callout>

## Python agent versions not supported [#eol-versions]

**End of life notification:** As of January 26, 2015, we will no longer accept data from Python agent versions earlier than **2.42.0**.

These agent versions use an out-of-date protocol when communicating with our data collection services. In addition, many of these versions contain a potential security issue where they may incorrectly send sensitive data to our data collector.

## Update unsupported agent versions [#eol-update]

<Callout variant="important">
  If you are updating from an older agent version, including major version jumps, review the following list for changes in functionality.
</Callout>

        Manual override for the path to your local CA bundle. This CA bundle will be used to validate the SSL certificate presented by our data collection service. Set with the [Python agent config file](/docs/agents/python-agent/configuration/python-agent-configuration#ca-bundle-path).

        **Previously deprecated APIs removed:**

        * `Transaction.add_user_attribute` (use `Transaction.add_custom_parameter`)
        * `Transaction.add_user_attributes` (use `Transaction.add_custom_parameters`)
        * `wrap_callable` (use `FunctionWrapper`)

        **Removed support for Python 2.6 and Python 3.3:**

        Python 2.6 and Python 3.3 are no longer supported. **Recommendation:** Update your application to a supported version of Python in order to continue to receive updates to the Python agent.

        **Python versions 2.6 and 3.3:**

        These are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower.

        * `Transaction.add_user_attributes` has been deprecated in favor of `Transaction.add_custom_parameters`. `Transaction.add_user_attributes` will be removed in a future release.
        * `wrap_callable` has been deprecated in favor of `FunctionWrapper`. `wrap_callable` will be removed in a future release.
        * `data-source admin command`: The platform API (used by `newrelic-admin data-source`) has been removed. Please use data sources in place of the platform API.

        **Deprecated config settings:**

        Several configuration settings have been deprecated. The most commonly used of the deprecated settings are `capture_params` and `ignored_params`. To achieve the same functionality as the old settings, use the new `attributes.include` and `attributes.exclude` settings.

        **Deprecated API:**

        Do not use the agent API function `add_user_attribute()`, which is now deprecated. Instead, use the `add_custom_parameter()` function.

        Optional: To display these parameters in browser traces, enable the `browser_monitoring.capture_attributes` agent configuration setting.

      </td>

      <td>
        **Proxy settings:**

        Python agent versions 2.0.0 or earlier do not provide the `proxy_scheme` setting, and the protocol scheme defaults to http or https depending on whether [SSL](/docs/agents/python-agent/configuration/python-agent-configuration#ssl) is disabled or enabled.

        If you are updating from an older agent version and your config file doesn't include `proxy_scheme`, ensure you add the setting and set it appropriately. If you don't, the agent will continue to base the protocol scheme on the SSL setting for backwards compatibility.

        Proxies are usually only configured to accept proxy requests via the http protocol scheme. If you do not set `proxy_scheme`, this may result in a failure.

        **Thread profiling for WSGI servers:**

        We have disabled the ability to get thread profiling information when a WSGI server uses coroutine libraries such as `gevent` or `eventlet`. This is because, due to the nature of how coroutines are implemented, we are not able to generate accurate usable data.

        **Attributes from WSGI requests:**

        Attributes captured from WSGI request environments such as `REQUEST_METHOD`, `HTTP_REFERER`, and `HTTP_USER_AGENT` now appear in the UI under the **Request environment** category in error details and slow transaction traces. Previously they appeared in the UI under **Custom parameters**.
