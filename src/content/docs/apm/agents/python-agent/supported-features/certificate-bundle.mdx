## Frequently Asked Questions

> What is a certificate bundle?

A certificate bundle essentially provides a list of “trust” roots. It tells the agent who to trust when communicating with the backend.

For more details, here's a good description on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_trust).

> Why is the certificate bundle provided?

Many customers run in docker. Sometimes, those images don't provide their own certificate bundles because the images aren't usually used to communicate over HTTP. We provide our own bundle so that customers have an easier time installing the agent.

> When is the certificate bundle used?

When system certificates are available, the agent will default to using those over the included certificate bundle. The certificate bundle is only used when no certificates are provided by the system.
