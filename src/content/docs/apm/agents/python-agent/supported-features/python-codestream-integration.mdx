Display context-sensitive APM data directly in your IDE by integrating [New Relic CodeStream](/docs/codestream/how-use-codestream/performance-monitoring#code-level) with the Python agent. Visualize code-level production telemetry in your editor as your write and review code with this integration.

## Getting started

First, [install](/docs/codestream/start-here/install-codestream) the New Relic CodeStream extension into your supported IDE of choice and login.

<Callout variant="important">
  The New Relic Code Level Metrics integration is available in Python Agent version 7.10.0.175 and higher and is enabled by default. To change this configuration, check out our documentation.

## Agent attributes

The Python agent reports and attaches the following attributes to spans produced by your application:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        **Name**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Description**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Example**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `code.function`
      </td>

      <td>
        The name of the instrumented function
      </td>

      <td>
        validate_credentials
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `code.filepath`
      </td>

      <td>
        The absolute path to the source code file in which `code.function` is defined
      </td>

      <td>
        /usr/local/apps/test-app/main.py
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `code.lineno`
      </td>

      <td>
        The line number where `code.function` is defined in code.filepath
      </td>

      <td>
        639
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `code.namespace`
      </td>

      <td>
        The namespace (class/ module name) in which `code.function` is defined
      </td>

      <td>
        example.service.MyService
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<Callout variant="important">
Not every function in your application code will be instrumented with the above attributes. In some cases, the agent will directly wrap base framework code (ie. Django, Flask, etc.) that is invoked within your application and will not display within your IDE.
