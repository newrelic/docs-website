With the Python agent, you can add [browser monitoring](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-browser) to your webpages either automatically or manually. To enable <InlinePopover type="browser"/> in the user interface, follow the procedures to [install the browser agent](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation/install-new-relic-browser-agent). Then follow the procedures in this section to set up the Python agent.

To use the browser agent with your Python agent, ensure you have the latest release. For more information, see the [agent installation instructions](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-and-configuration/python-agent-installation).

## Support for automatic instrumentation [#restrictions_on_instrumentation]

The Python agent only supports automatic instrumentation for WSGI applications that are hosted directly on a dedicated WSGI server with a native WSGI interface, and where the WSGI application returns the HTML page response via an iterable/generator.

Automatic instrumentation requires a dedicated WSGI server.

* WSGI servers such as Apache/mod_wsgi, gunicorn and uWSGI are supported.
* Using WSGI adapters on top of either the Tornado or Twisted frameworks is not supported.

The Python agent does not support insertion of instrumentation when using the `write()` callback returned from the WSGI `start_response()` function to write back the HTML page response. For more information about requirements for automatic instrumentation, see [Troubleshooting browser instrumentation in Python](/docs/agents/python-agent/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-page-load-timing-python).

## Use automatic instrumentation [#automatic_instrumentation]

The Python agent can automatically add the browser JavaScript agent to any HTML page responses. For WSGI applications, the agent uses a WSGI middleware installed into the request pipeline. Since the middleware is at WSGI level, automatic instrumentation should work for any WSGI application regardless of the web framework you are using, including popular Python web frameworks such as Django, Flask and Pyramid.

## Disable instrumentation for specific pages [#disabling_instrumentation]

If you want to use automatic instrumentation, but have an HTML page response that you do not want instrumented, you can disable instrumentation for that request. Add this [Python agent API call](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-configuration#disable_browser_autorum) into the code for that request handler:

```py
newrelic.agent.disable_browser_autorum()
```

If you are using a WSGI server that allows [per-request configuration](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-configuration#per-request-configuration), such as Apache/mod_wsgi, you can also disable automatic instrumentation by setting the [`newrelic.disable_browser_autorum`](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-configuration#disable_browser_autorum) key for that request in the WSGI environ dictionary passed into your monitored application.

For example, if using Apache/mod_wsgi, you could disable automatic instrumentation by filtering on the URL:

```apacheconf
<Location /login>
SetEnv newrelic.disable_browser_autorum true
</Location>
```

## Manually enable browser monitoring for specific pages [#manual_instrumentation]

You can manually add browser instrumentation to specific pages. This is useful, for example, if automatic instrumentation is not possible for your application, if you use a nonced content security policy, or if you want to collect browser data for only specific pages.

The calls in this procedure must be placed on <DNT>**every**</DNT> request you want to monitor. You <DNT>**cannot**</DNT> call these functions once at global scope and cache the result for later use.

<Callout variant="caution">
  The `get_browser_timing_footer` API was deprecated in version 9.4.0 and completely removed in version 11.0.0.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="important">
  Starting with Python Agent version 9.4.0+, the `get_browser_timing_footer` API has deprecated and always returns an empty string. The previous functionality of `get_browser_timing_footer()` is now included in [`get_browser_timing_header()`](/docs/apm/agents/python-agent/python-agent-api/getbrowsertimingheader-python-agent-api).

  On older versions of the agent, the footer is required to load the browser agent.
</Callout>

1. Disable automatic instrumentation: In the <DNT>**newrelic.ini**</DNT> file, set [`browser_monitoring.auto_instrument`](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-configuration#browser-auto) to `false`.
2. Restart your application.
3. Place these calls into the request handler of <DNT>**every**</DNT> page you want to monitor:

   ```py
   import newrelic.agent

   header = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_header()
   # The footer is required on Python Agent versions 9.3.0 and below.
   footer = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_footer()
   ```
4. Pass the `header` and possibly `footer` variables to the HTML response.
5. On the corresponding page, insert the `header` variable in the `<head>` element. Place the `header` variable after any `charset` properties or any meta tags for `http-equiv` with a value of `X-UA-Compatible`.
6. If required, insert the `footer` variable before the end of the `<body>` element.

Wait a few minutes, then [check your browser monitoring data](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/browser-overview-website-performance-glance). If no data appears after waiting a few minutes, see [Troubleshooting browser instrumentation in Python](/docs/agents/python-agent/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-page-load-timing-python).

## CSP Nonce support [#csp-nonce-support]

CSP Nonce usage in our browser instrumentation is supported in version 9.4.0+ of the Python agent. To use a nonce with the browser instrumentation, you must disable browser monitoring auto instrumentation and use the manual instrumentation via the agent API.

You may now pass a nonce as an argument into the API method to allow the agent to insert the nonce into the browser instrumentation.

1. Disable automatic instrumentation: In the `newrelic.ini` file, set [`browser_monitoring.auto_instrument`](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-configuration#browser-auto) to `false`.
2. Restart your application.
3. Place these calls into the request handler of <DNT>**every**</DNT> page you want to monitor, replacing "NONCE" with your CSP nonce:

   ```py
   import newrelic.agent

   header = newrelic.agent.get_browser_timing_header("NONCE")
   ```
4. Pass the `header` variable to the HTML response.
5. On the corresponding page, insert the `header` variable in the `<head>` element. Place the `header` variable after any `charset` properties or any meta tags for `http-equiv` with a value of `X-UA-Compatible`.
