This document lists the packages and modules automatically instrumented by the [Python agent](/docs/agents/python-agent/getting-started/new-relic-python) after you [install](/docs/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-quick-start) it. You can also use [custom instrumentation](/docs/agents/python-agent/supported-features/python-custom-instrumentation) if you want to:

* Disable instrumentation for specific packages or modules if the instrumentation interferes with your app.
* Instrument a-third party package or module that is not instrumented automatically by the agent.
* Add more specific instrumentation for your own code, such as to track the time spent in additional functions.

To request built-in instrumentation for additional packages, get support at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com).

## GraphQL Frameworks

The Python agent provides insight into your GraphQL application's operations and resolvers and reports GraphQL-specific metrics and span attributes. For more information on transaction naming and other features, please view our [GraphQL documentation](/docs/agents/python-agent/supported-features/python-graphQL). As of agent version 6.10.0.165, the agent supports the following GraphQL frameworks:

* [Graphene](https://docs.graphene-python.org/en/latest/)
* [Ariadne](https://ariadnegraphql.org/docs/intro)
* [Strawberry](https://strawberry.rocks/)
* [Starlette GraphQL](https://www.starlette.io/graphql/)
* [FastAPI GraphQL](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/graphql/)
* [GraphQL Server](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-server)

## Instance details

The agent collects [instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers](/docs/apm/applications-menu/features/analyze-database-instance-level-performance-issues). The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information depends on your Python agent version.

Python agent [version 2.72.0.52 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/python-release-notes) supports the following:

    <tr>

## SQL database adapters

For Python DB-API 2.0 compliant modules listed in this section, the Python agent supports:

* Timing of database queries
* Capturing SQL for the database query
* Capturing a stack trace for long database queries
* MySQL and PostgreSQ only: Capturing explain plans for slow database queries

The Python agent should be able to track database queries for any Python DB-API 2.0 compliant modules. However, the Python agent only officially supports the modules listed in this section.

* [cx_Oracle](http://cx-oracle.sourceforge.net/)
* [MySQLdb](http://mysql-python.sourceforge.net/)
* [oursql](https://launchpad.net/oursql)
* [proboscis](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/proboscis)
* [psycopg2](http://initd.org/psycopg/)
* [psycopg2ct](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/psycopg2ct)
* [psycopg2cffi](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/psycopg2cffi)
* [pymysql](https://github.com/petehunt/PyMySQL)
* [pyodbc](https://pypi.org/project/pyodbc/)
* [ibm_db_dbi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ibm_db)
* [mysql-connector-python](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/index.html)
* [py-postgresql](http://python.projects.pgfoundry.org/)
* [pymssql](http://www.pymssql.org/)

For the following database adapters, we provides additional instrumentation for functionality outside of the DB-API 2.0 specification, such as shortcut methods to execute queries without creating cursors:

* [pysqlite2](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pysqlite/)
* [sqlite3](http://docs.python.org/library/sqlite3.html)

If your database client module is not listed in this section, get support at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com). New Relic Support may be able to suggest a temporary change to your config file to get it working.
