Our Python agent monitors your Python application to help you identify and solve [performance issues](#monitor-performance). You can also extend your performance monitoring to collect and analyze [business data](#business-data) to help you improve the customer experience and make data-driven business decisions. With flexible options for [custom instrumentation and APIs](/docs/agents/python-agent/custom-instrumentation/python-custom-instrumentation), The Python agent offers multiple building blocks to customize the data you need from your app.

Our Python works with a wide variety of [web frameworks and hosting mechanisms](/docs/agents/python-agent/getting-started/instrumented-python-packages), including Django, Gunicorn, WSGI, CherryPy, uWSGI, and more. You can also install the Python agent in a [Google App Engine flexible environment](/docs/agents/python-agent/hosting-services/install-new-relic-python-agent-gae-flexible-environment).

## Monitor app performance [#monitor-performance]

After you [install](#installation) the Python agent, it begins to collect data about your app. You can view the data as charts and tables in the [New Relic UI](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one).

<DNT>
  **View the big picture of your app:**
</DNT>

* Monitor your app's [Apdex (user satisfaction)](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction).
* Get a high-level summary of your app with [Summary page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page).
* Enable [distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing) to see activity across an architecture having many services.
* Install [Infrastructure monitoring](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-infrastructure) and view detailed server/host data for your app.

<DNT>
  **Find errors and problems quickly:**
</DNT>

* Track [key transactions](/docs/apm/transactions/key-transactions/key-transactions-tracking-important-transactions-or-events) specific to your business.
* Create [custom dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-dashboards/custom-dashboards/custom-dashboards) for important metrics.
* [Alert](/docs/alerts/alert-policies/understanding-alert-policies/alerting-new-relic) your team when an error or problem occurs before it affects your users.
* View performance [after a deployment](/docs/apm/applications-menu/events/deployments-page).

<DNT>
  **Drill down into performance details:**
</DNT>

* Examine code-level [transaction traces](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/transaction-traces).
* Examine [database query traces](/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/troubleshoot-sql-statements).
* Examine [error traces](/docs/apm/applications-menu/events/view-apm-error-analytics).
* Use [thread profiler sessions](/docs/apm/applications-menu/events/thread-profiler-tool) to see detailed stack traces of sampled threads

<DNT>
  **View logs for your APM and infrastructure data:**
</DNT>

Bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. No need to switch to another UI page.

* With [logs in context](/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-python/), you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI.
* You can also see logs in context of your [infrastructure data](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/), such as Kubernetes clusters.

        * Use [default transaction attributes](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/decorating-events/apm-default-attributes-insights), or [add your own](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/decorating-events/insights-custom-attributes).
        * Query your data using the [New Relic Query Language (NRQL)](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data).

## Install the Python agent [#installation]

Before you install the Python agent, make sure your system meets the [system requirements](/docs/agents/python-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-python-agent). You must also create a [New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup).

We support a number of web frameworks and libraries right out of the box, including Django, WSGI, and Gunicorn. If you use one of the [supported web frameworks](/docs/agents/python-agent/getting-started/instrumented-python-packages), installation is easy. If you use an unsupported framework, the process will involve some additions to your app code and/or web server files.

For a quick and simple install process that will work for the majority of setups, follow these simple steps:

1. Download and install the Python package.
2. Create config file.
3. Integrate the Python agent with your application.

  </ButtonLink>
</ButtonGroup>

## Monitor non-web scripts, background tasks, and functions [#non-web]

The Python agent also lets you monitor non-web scripts, worker processes, tasks, and functions. The installation process for these non-web transactions is similar to the one used for a web app, with one major difference: instead of going through the standard integration process described in the [install instructions](/docs/agents/python-agent/getting-started/python-agent-quick-start), you would manually "wrap" any function you want to monitor. For more information, see [Non-web tasks and processes](/docs/agents/python-agent/supported-features/python-background-tasks). For instructions on monitoring Celery tasks, see [Celery background tasks](/docs/agents/python-agent/back-end-services/python-agent-celery).

## What's next after installation? [#instrumentation]

Once you get the agent up and running, some suggested next steps are:

* Explore your data in and get comfortable with the user interface.
* Read our docs on [our other observability solutions](/docs/full-stack-observability/monitor-everything/get-started-new-relic-monitoring-tools/get-started-full-stack-observability) and the [APM page](/docs/apm).
* [Change your application's name](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/rename-your-application), or other [configuration options](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-configuration).
* Learn about setting up [custom instrumentation](/docs/agents/python-agent/custom-instrumentation/python-custom-instrumentation) for application activity not monitored by default.
* Consider the [Python Telemetry SDK](/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/new-relic-sdks/telemetry-sdks-send-custom-telemetry-data-new-relic).

## Troubleshooting

After you complete the install process, your data should appear in the [APM UI](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page) within five minutes. If it does not, use these troubleshooting resources:

* If no data appears, follow these [troubleshooting steps](/docs/agents/python-agent/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-python).
* If you experience issues when installing or running the Python agent on a new host, [test that the package is installed correctly](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/testing-python-agent) and that it can contact New Relic's data collector service.
* For other problems, see the [full list of troubleshooting documentation](/docs/agents/python-agent/troubleshooting/).

## Check the source code [#source-code]

The Python agent is open source software. That means you can [browse its source code](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-python-agent) and send improvements, or create your own fork and build it. For more information, see the [README](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-python-agent/blob/main/README.rst).
