Before you install our Python agent, make sure your system meets these requirements.

## Basic requirements [#basic]

The Python agent supports many of the most common Python web frameworks. Additional configuration may be required depending on your specific hosting mechanism, hosting service, web framework, or back-end services. See the table below for support details.

If you don't have one already, [create a New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup). It's free, forever.

        Python (CPython/PyPy) versions supported: 2.7, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11.

        **Recommendation:** Use Python version 3.7 or higher with our agent.

        * Python versions 2.6 and 3.3 are supported only by Python agent versions 3.4.0.95 or lower.
        * Python version 3.4 is supported only by Python agent versions 4.20.0.120 or lower.
        * Python version 3.5 is supported only by Python agent versions 5.24.0.153 or lower.
        * Python version 3.6 is supported only by Python agent versions 7.16.0.178 or lower.
        * For Python version 2.7 follow our [end of life (EOL) support](#version) requirements.

      <td>
        Some WSGI servers, frameworks, and apps have special requirements. Although a specific Python WSGI web framework may not be supported, you can still use the agent. For unsupported frameworks, a breakout of time spent in key parts of the framework will not appear in web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces.

        In addition, the agent will not be able to meaningfully group any web transactions handled by specific handlers in your code that you use to make them more useful and targeted. In these situations you can use the Python agent API to name web transactions or add custom instrumentation.

        If your application uses other monitoring software besides ours, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see [Errors while using other monitoring software](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/troubleshooting/errors-while-using-new-relic-apm-alongside-other-apm-software).

## Python package instrumentation [#python-packages]

The agent also provides instrumentation for a range of other Python [packages and modules](/docs/agents/python-agent/getting-started/instrumented-python-packages). Instrumentation includes database queries, memcache requests, external service requests, [instance-level details](/docs/apm/applications-menu/features/analyze-database-instance-level-performance-issues), and more. The results will appear automatically in APM's user interface within web transaction performance breakdowns and transaction traces for slow transactions.

## Instrumented package version support [#package-version]

The Python agent actively supports and tests instrumented packages within a three year release window.

## Agent version support [#agent-version]

New Relic recommends that you upgrade the agent regularly and at a minimum every 3 months. Agent versions are a supported within a one year release window.

## Python version support [#python-version]

The agent in general will support all released and active [Python branches](https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches). However, to keep up with upcoming changes, the agent will also follow this Python version support schedule. The version support policy does not replace our [general end-of-life (EOL) policy](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/maintenance/new-relic-agent-plugin-end-life-policy).

### Support for new Python releases [#support-new]

The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary.

## Connect the agent to other capabilities [#digital-intelligence-platform]

The Python agent integrates with other capabilities to give you end-to-end visibility:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Product
      </th>

      <th>
        Integration
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        [Browser monitoring](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-browser)
      </td>

      <td>
        The Python agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you [enable auto-instrumentation](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation/install-new-relic-browser-agent#select-apm-app). After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the [APM Summary page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page) and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see [Browser monitoring and the Python agent](/docs/agents/python-agent/supported-features/page-load-timing-python).

    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        [Infrastructure monitoring](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-infrastructure)
      </td>

      <td>
        When you install the Infrastructure monitoring and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure monitoring UI. For more information, see [APM data in Infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/data-instrumentation/new-relic-apm-data-infrastructure).

        [Synthetic monitoring](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-synthetics)
      </td>

      <td>
        [Synthetic transaction traces](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/collect-synthetic-transaction-traces) connect requests from synthetic monitors to the underlying APM transaction.
