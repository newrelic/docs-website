The Python agent can be used with FastCGI in conjunction with [flup](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flup). There are no known special requirements or restrictions, so you can follow the general integration procedures in [Install the Python agent](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-installation).

## Admin script integration example [#integration-wrapper-code]

For FastCGI, the web application is always managed as an external process. If you have integrated the FastCGI/WSGI adapter for flup, as in:

```
#!/usr/bin/env python

import sys
from fcgi import WSGIServer

def application(environ, start_response):
    status = '200 OK'
    output = 'Hello World!'

    response_headers = [('Content-type', 'text/plain'),
                        ('Content-Length', str(len(output)))]
    start_response(status, response_headers)

    return [output]

ret = WSGIServer(application).run()
```

and if you are starting your FastCGI process as a Python script directly with Python as `python app.py`, instead run:

```
NEW_RELIC_CONFIG_FILE=newrelic.ini newrelic-admin run-program python app.py
```

For more on the install process, see [Install the Python agent](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-installation).
