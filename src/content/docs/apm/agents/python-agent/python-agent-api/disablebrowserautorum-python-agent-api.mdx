## Syntax

```py
newrelic.agent.disable_browser_autorum(flag=True)
```

Disables browser monitoring for a web request.

## Description

This call disables [browser monitoring](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-browser) for the page/request it is called for. This call only affects the current web request and must be called prior to the point where the browser agent header/footer JavaScript are injected. For more on how the browser agent JavaScript is inserted, see [Install browser monitoring](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation-configuration/add-apps-new-relic-browser).

<Callout variant="tip">
  You can also disable browser injection by setting the `newrelic.disable_browser_autorum` key for the specific request in the WSGI environ dictionary passed by the WSGI server into the WSGI application being monitored.
</Callout>

## Examples

### Disabling browser monitoring [#example]

In this example, you've upgraded the agent and you've noticed the N JavaScript that's automatically injected onto the HTML page is also being injected into every iFrame that is loaded on those pages. This has caused your pageviews to increase substantially.

On those specific iFrame views, you would make this call:

```py
newrelic.agent.disable_browser_autorum()
```
