The following are the specific policies and dates for support of our Go agent. See our documentation about [general EOL policies](/docs/licenses/end-of-life/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software/) for information about New Relic's overall end-of-life policy.
Note that each relese of the Go agent only supports the three most recent versions of Go at the time of release. We only support versions of the go release that are actively supported by the Go team, and the version of Go that was most recently out of the support window.

## New Relic Go agent releases and support dates [#go-eol]
