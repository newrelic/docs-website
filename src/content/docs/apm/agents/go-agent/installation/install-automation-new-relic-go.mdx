<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

Go is a compiled language with an opaque runtime, making it unable to support automatic instrumentation like other languages. For this reason, the New Relic Go agent is designed as an SDK. Since the Go agent is an SDK, it requires more manual work to set up than agents for languages that support automatic instrumentation.

In an effort to make instrumentation easier, the Go agent team created the Go easy instrumentation tool that is currently in preview. This tool does most of the work for you by suggesting changes to your source code that instrument your application with the New Relic Go agent.

To get started, check out this [four-minute video](https://asciinema.org/a/r0Il7o2eMiZaLKHIlew3IL2nx), or skip down to [How it works](#how-it-works).

    This feature is currently provided as part of a product preview and is subject to our New Relic Experimental policies. Recommended code changes are suggestions only and should be subject to human review for accuracy, applicability, and appropriateness for your environment. This feature should only be used in non-critical, non-production environments that do not contain sensitive data.

    This project, its code, and the UX are under heavy development, so you should expect it to change. Please take this into consideration when participating in this preview. If you encounter any issues, please report them using [Github issues](https://github.com/newrelic/go-easy-instrumentation) and fill out as much of the issue template as you can so we can improve this tool.

## How it works [#how-it-works]

This tool doesn't interfere with your application's operation, and it doesn't make any changes to your code directly. Here's what happens:

* It analyzes your code and suggests changes that allow the Go agent to capture telemetry data.      
* You review the changes in the `.diff` file and decide which changes to add to your source code.

As part of the analysis, this tool may invoke `go get` or other Go language toolchain commands which may modify your `go.mod` file, but not your actual source code.

<Callout variant="important">
  This tool can't detect if you already have New Relic instrumentation. Please only use this tool on applications without any instrumentation.
</Callout>

## What is instrumented? [#what-is-instrumented]

The scope of what this tool can instrument in your application is limited to these actions:

* Capturing errors in any function wrapped or traced by a transaction
* Tracing locally defined functions that are invoked in the application's `main()` method with a transaction
* Tracing async functions and function literals with an async segment
* Wrapping HTTP handlers
* Injecting distributed tracing into external traffic

### Supported Libraries [#supported-libraries]

* standard library
* net/http

## Installation [#go-easy-install]

Before you start the installation steps below, make sure you have a version of Go installed that is within the support window for the current [Go programming language lifecycle](https://endoflife.date/go).

Install Go easy instrumentation:
```sh
go install github.com/newrelic/go-easy-instrumentation@latest
```

    >
    The easiest way to use the installed `go-easy-instrumentation` binary is by adding your `GOPATH` bin to your `PATH`.

    <CollapserGroup>
      <Collapser
          id="unix-gopath"
          title="Mac or Linux"
      >
      In your terminal, bashrc, or zshrc, the following line adds the path to your `GOPATH` bin to your `PATH`:
      ```sh
      export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
      ```
      </Collapser>
      <Collapser
          id="windows-gopath"
          title="Windows"
      >
      In a windows terminal or powershell window, the following line will add the path to your `GOPATH` bin to your `PATH`:
      ```sh
      go env -w GOPATH=c:\go-work
      ```
      </Collapser>

## Generate instrumentation suggestions [#generate-suggestions]

This tool works best with Git. We recommend you verify your application is on a branch without any unstaged changes before applying any of the generated changes to it. After checking that, follow these steps to generate and apply the changes that install the New Relic Go agent in an application:

1. Run the following CLI command to create a file named `new-relic-instrumentation.diff` in your working directory:
    ```sh
    go-easy-instrumentation -path ../my-application/
    ```
2. Open the `.diff` file and verify or correct the contents.
3. When you are satisfied with the instrumentation suggestions, save the file, and then apply the changes:
    ```sh
    mv new-relic-instrumentation.diff ../my-application/
    cd ../my-application
    git apply new-relic-instrumentation.diff
    ```

Once the changes are applied, the application should run with the New Relic Go agent installed. If the agent installation is not working the way you want it to, you can easily recover by using common Git commands. For example, you could try one of the following:

*  Stash the changes with `git stash`
*  Revert the code to a previous commit
