Read on to learn how to enable and set up [distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing) for the New Relic's Go agent.

## Enable distributed tracing [#enable]

To enable distributed tracing for a Go application:

1. Use [Go agent configuration settings](/docs/agents/go-agent/configuration/go-agent-configuration#distributed-tracing) for the type of distributed tracing you want:
   * Standard distributed tracing
   * Infinite Tracing
2. Continue reading the [transaction and request instrumentation guidelines](#guidelines) below.

  For help understanding the different types of agent distributed tracing, see [How distributed tracing works](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works).

## Instrument transactions and HTTP requests [#guidelines]

In order for distributed tracing to work optimally, your Go application must adhere to guidelines for the following scenarios:

    id="create-transactions"
    title="Instrument transactions (if using ServeMux)"
  >
    If you are using Go's [`http.ServeMux`](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ServeMux) and want to enable New Relic's distributed tracing, your Go application must be instrumented with New Relic's `WrapHandle` and `WrapHandleFunc` wrappers. These wrappers automatically start and end transactions with the request and response writer, which will automatically add the correct distributed tracing headers. For more on how header propagation works, see [How distributed tracing works](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works).

    <CollapserGroup>
      <Collapser
        id="example-go-instrumentation"
        title="Before and after example"
      >
        Here is an example of code before instrumentation:

        ```
        http.HandleFunc("/users", usersHandler)
        ```

        And here is an example of that same code after instrumentation:

        ```
        http.HandleFunc(newrelic.WrapHandleFunc(app, "/users", usersHandler))
        ```
      </Collapser>
    </CollapserGroup>

    Read more about using these wrappers in [Instrument Go transactions](/docs/agents/go-agent/get-started/instrument-go-transactions#http-handler-txns).

  <Collapser
    id="make-http-requests"
    title="Instrument outbound HTTP requests as external segments"
  >
    In order to have your outbound HTTP requests eligible for distributed tracing, [create an external segment](/docs/agents/go-agent/get-started/instrument-go-segments#go-external-segments).

    The easiest way to create an external segment for your outbound HTTP request is to use the `newrelic.NewRoundTripper` method. Here is an example of making a request to `http://api.example.com` that includes the outgoing distributed tracing headers:

    ```
    func useNewRoundTripper(txn *newrelic.Transaction) (*http.Response, error) {
        client := &http.Client{}
        client.Transport = newrelic.NewRoundTripper(client.Transport)
        request, _ := http.NewRequest("GET", "http://example.com", nil)
        request = newrelic.RequestWithTransactionContext(request, txn)
        return client.Do(request)
    }
    ```

    If you have a more complex request that uses the Go standard library's `http.Request`, use the `newrelic.StartExternalSegment` method to ensure your outbound request is eligible for distributed tracing:

    ```
    func external(txn *newrelic.Transaction, req *http.Request) (*http.Response, error) { 
        s := newrelic.StartExternalSegment(txn, req) 
        response, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req) 
        s.Response = response 
        s.End() 
        return response, err
    }
    ```

    An `ExternalSegment` created with a struct literal cannot be used for distributed tracing. Because of this, New Relic recommends using [`newrelic.NewRoundTripper` or `newrelic.StartExternalSegment`](/docs/agents/go-agent/get-started/instrument-go-segments#go-external-segments).

    ```
    func noGoodForDt(txn *newrelic.Transaction, url string) (*http.Response, error) {
        // Distributed tracing headers are not added to the outgoing request.
        // Use newrelic.NewRoundTripper or newrelicc.StartExternalSegment instead.
        defer newrelic.ExternalSegment{
            StartTime: txn.StartSegmentNow(),
            URL:       url,
        }.End()

        return http.Get(url)
    }
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="create-manually"
    title="Manually create and accept distributed trace payload"
  >
    The distributed trace payload contains information that allows New Relic to stitch together transactions occurring in multiple services into a complete transaction trace. If New Relic-monitored services are not sending trace context to each other, it will result in incomplete trace details.

## Examine logs for trace details [#logs-context]

You can bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With [logs in context](/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-go/), you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI.

1. From the **Transactions** page, click on a trace to go to the [**Trace details** page](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/transaction-traces-trace-details-page).
2. From the trace details page, click **See logs**.
3. To view details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message.


You can also see logs in context of your [infrastructure data](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/), such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in.
