metaDescription: How to implement cross application tracing with the Go agent in order to connect transactions across APM-monitored apps.

The Go agent supports [cross application tracing (CAT)](/docs/apm/transactions/cross-application-traces/introduction-cross-application-traces). Cross application tracing links transactions between APM-monitored app, which is vital for applications implementing a service-oriented or microservices architecture.

  [Distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing) is now available. Distributed tracing is an improvement on cross application tracing and is recommended for large, distributed systems.

## Enable cross application tracing with Go [#enable]

You can enable or disable cross application tracing in the Go agent by using the [`CrossApplicationTracer.Enabled`](/docs/agents/go-agent/instrumentation/go-agent-configuration#cross-tracer-enabled) configuration flag.

## Transaction and HTTP request guidelines with Go [#guidelines]

Even with cross application tracing enabled, you'll need to make sure your application follows a few simple conventions when responding to HTTP(s) requests, making its own HTTP(s) requests, or [creating its own transactions](/docs/agents/go-agent/get-started/instrument-go-transactions).

    If you're using Go's [`http.ServeMux`](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ServeMux) and want CAT support, you'll need to use the agent's `WrapHandle` and `WrapHandleFunc` wrappers. These wrappers automatically start and end transactions with the request and response writer, which will [automatically add the correct CAT headers](/docs/apm/transactions/cross-application-traces/introduction-cross-application-traces#security). Your code should look similar to the following:

    ```
    http.HandleFunc("/users", usersHandler)
        http.HandleFunc(newrelic.WrapHandleFunc(app, "/users", usersHandler))
    ```

    You can read more about these wrappers in [Instrument Go transactions](/docs/agents/go-agent/get-started/instrument-go-transactions#http-handler-txns).

    When creating your own transactions with `app.StartTransaction`, ensure that you also call `Transaction.SetWebRequest` and `Transaction.SetWebResponse`. For example, a transaction started with the following code will have CAT enabled:

    ```
    txn := app.StartTransaction("<var>transactionName</var>")
    // req is a *http.Request, this marks the transaction as a web transaction
    txn.SetWebRequestHTTP(req)

    // writer is a http.ResponseWriter, use the returned writer in place of the original
    writer = txn.SetWebResponse(writer)
    writer.WriteHeader(500)

    defer txn.End()
    ```

    However, a transaction started without the calls to `Transaction.SetWebRequest` and `Transaction.SetWebResponse` **will not** have CAT enabled:

    ```
    // Cross application tracing not enabled
    txn := app.StartTransaction("<var>transactionName</var>")
    defer txn.End()
    ```

    Additionally, if you're setting HTTP response codes, use the Go agent's `txn.WriteHeader` method rather than the standard library's [`http.ResponseWriter.WriteHeader`](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ResponseWriter) method.

    ```
    // old code
    // writer.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)

    // replace with this
    txn := app.StartTransaction("<var>transactionName</var>")
    txn.SetWebRequest(req)
    writer = txn.SetWebResponse(writer)
    writer.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)
    ```

    In order to have your outbound HTTP(s) requests eligible for CAT, you'll need to [create an external segment](/docs/agents/go-agent/get-started/instrument-go-segments#go-external-segments).

    The easiest way to create an external segment for your outbound HTTP(s) request is to use the `newrelic.NewRoundTripper` method. For example, this code will make a request to `http://api.example.com/` that includes the outgoing CAT headers.

    ```
    func useNewRoundTripper(txn *newrelic.Transaction) (*http.Response, error) {
        client := &http.Client{}
        client.Transport = newrelic.NewRoundTripper(client.Transport)
        req, _ := http.NewRequest("GET", "<var>http://api.example.com/</var>", nil)
        req = newrelic.RequestWithTransactionContext(req, txn)
        return client.Do(req)
    }
    ```

    If you have a more complex request that uses the Go standard library's `http.Request`, you'll need to use the `newrelic.StartExternalSegment` method to ensure your outbound request is eligible for CAT.

    ```
    func external(txn *newrelic.Transaction, req *http.Request) (*http.Response, error) {
        s := newrelic.StartExternalSegment(txn, req)
        response, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)
        s.Response = response
        s.End()
        return response, err
    }
    ```

    While it's also possible to create an `ExternalSegment` via a struct literal, this segment **will not** be eligible for CAT. Because of this, New Relic recommends using [`newrelic.NewRoundTripper` or `newrelic.ExternalSegment`](/docs/agents/go-agent/get-started/instrument-go-segments#go-external-segments).

    ```
    func noGoodForCat(txn *newrelic.Transaction, url string) (*http.Response, error) {
        // CAT headers not inserted
        defer newrelic.ExternalSegment{
            StartTime: txn.StartSegmentNow(),
            URL:       url,
        }.End()

        return http.Get(url)
    }
    ```

## Get distributed tracing [#distributed-tracing]

New Relic also offers [distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing). Distributed tracing is an improvement on cross application tracing and is recommended for large, distributed systems.
