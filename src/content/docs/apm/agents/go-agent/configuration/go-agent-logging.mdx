[New Relic for Go](/docs/agents/go-agent/get-started/new-relic-go) logging uses the standard [Go log package](https://golang.org/pkg/log/) and a New Relic `Logger` package. Logging is useful for [troubleshooting](/docs/agents/go-agent/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-go) your New Relic integration; for example, with [installation](/docs/agents/go-agent/get-started/install-new-relic-go) or [configuration](/docs/agents/go-agent/instrumentation/go-agent-configuration) problems.

## Write log files [#write-logfiles]

To use the Go agent methods for writing log and audit files, see [log.go on the agent GitHub repo](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/blob/master/log.go).

## Logrus integration example [#logrus]

New Relic offers an [integration for the Logrus logging system](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/blob/master/_integrations/nrlogrus/nrlogrus.go). Here is an example of using the New Relic Logrus integration in an application:

1. Import both `github.com/sirupsen/logrus` and `github.com/newrelic/go-agent/v3/integrations/nrlogrus`.
2. Set the log level and assign the Logger output to Logrus. For example:

   ```
   app, err := newrelic.NewApplication(
       newrelic.ConfigAppName("<var>Your Application Name</var>"),
       newrelic.ConfigLicense("<var>__YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY__</var>"),
       func(config *newrelic.Config) {
       	logrus.SetLevel(logrus.DebugLevel)
           config.Logger = nrlogrus.StandardLogger()
       },
   )
   ```

## View logs for your APM and infrastructure data [#logs-context]

You can also bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With [logs in context](/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-go/), you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your [infrastructure data](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/), such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One.
