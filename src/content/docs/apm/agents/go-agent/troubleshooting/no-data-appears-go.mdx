## Problem

You [installed the New Relic Go agent](/docs/agents/go-agent/get-started/install-new-relic-go) for your Golang app. After you generated some traffic and waited a few minutes, your app is still not reporting data in New Relic.

## Solution

After sending a request to your web application, data should appear in the <InlinePopover type="apm"/> UI within two to three minutes. If you still do not see any data on your app's [<DNT>**Summary**</DNT> page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page), try these troubleshooting tips:

1. Verify your [app's name](/docs/agents/go-agent/instrumentation/go-agent-configuration#app-name) and [license key](/docs/agents/go-agent/instrumentation/go-agent-configuration#license) in your Go agent configuration's [`newrelic.Config` struct](/docs/agents/go-agent/instrumentation/go-agent-configuration).
2. Use [New Relic Diagnostics](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/new-relic-diagnostics) to try to automatically identify the issue.
3. Make sure you instrumented your app's transactions with [`newrelic.WrapHandleFunc` or `Application.StartTransaction` and `Transaction.End`](/docs/agents/go-agent/get-started/instrument-go-transactions).
4. Restart your web server.
5. Use the [Go Logger interface to generate `Debug` level logs](/docs/agents/go-agent/instrumentation/go-agent-logging), and check those logs for errors.
6. If necessary, upgrade to the [latest New Relic Go agent release](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/go-release-notes).
