We all know what it's like to wake up in the morning to a ping from your leadership team telling you that something is going wrong and they need it fixed as soon as possible. This is where our APM tools come in. When you have limited time and increased urgency, you can use APM to to find failures in your applications and triage issues from one place.

For this example, we're going to explore a situation where you work for an e-commerce company and you manage the checkout team. You are alerted to the fact that the `Pay now` button because customers have been complaining they have to wait too long to checkout.

<Steps>

<Step>
### Open APM [#open-apm]
Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > All capabilities > APM and services**.

From there, click on the application that's causing the `Pay Now` button to react slowly. 

For the purposes of this example, the app will be called `Checkout-service`.

/>
</Step>

<Step>

### Select a time period [#time-picker]

It's important to make sure that you are looking at the right time segment. Based on the message you got from your leadership team, you know the checkout issues are happening now and so you want to hone in on what's actively happening in your system. 

Click on the time picker in the top-left, and select **Since 30 minutes ago**.

### Find the problematic transaction [#transactions]

You know that checkout is failing in your app but you're unsure of what's causing the actual error. In order to figure out what part of the checkout process is breaking you need to investigate your apps' `Transactions`. At New Relic, a transaction is defined as one logical unit of work in a software application. Specifically, it refers to the function calls and method calls that make up that unit of work. For APM, it will often refer to a web transaction, which represents activity that happens from when the application receives a web request to when the response is sent. 

In order to determine which transaction is breaking, click on the **Transactions** tab.

A slow transaction can be a strong indicator that something is behaving abnormally, so digging deeper into your slowest transaction is a good place to start. Once you click into **Transactions** you will see a list of all the "work" that is happening behind the scenes for your `Checkout-service` application. On the left-hand side you will see which transaction is taking the most time. 

For the purpose of this example, the slowest transaction is `Sinatra/Rubytron/POST #purchaseCart.` 

Click on the transaction.

</Step>

<Step>
### Dig deeper into your slowest transaction [#slow-transactions]

Now we've identified the slowest transaction `Sinatra/Rubytron/POST #purchaseCart` for the `Checkout-service` application and we want to learn more about how it's working. 

Each transaction is comprised of many different units of "work." For example, for the `Sinatra/Rubytron/POST #purchaseCart` transaction a unit of work could be validating the input, performing business logic, or updating a database.

The **Transactions detail** page provides a holistic view of a single transaction by breaking it down into individual pieces of work. The histogram on top visually demonstrates which pieces of the transaction are responding slower than others. 

We want to figure out where the `Sinatra/Rubytron/POST #purchaseCart` transaction could be failing: databases, servers, controllers, or middleware. You can toggle between each different segment of the transaction to identify trends and spikes.

In the gif below you will see how you can toggle between segments to isolate different areas of the transaction and spot problem areas. Here you can see that the controller, `Sinatra/Rubytron/POST` is the slowest segment and is taking 59.83% of the transaction's total time.

    src={accountsSelectSlowestTransaction}
/>

</Step>

<Step>
### Take a look at throughput [#throughput]

While looking at response time for this transaction, you can also investigate throughput. Throughput is a way to measure the amount of work your application is handling. Throughput helps you understand if work is evenly distributed between your hosts and containers. Performance issues can often be a symptom of lack of resources. 

Since you're experiencing a spike in errors in the `Checkout-service` application and the `Sinatra/Rubytron/POST #purchaseCart` transaction, it's helpful to compare those errors with your throughput results. 

For the purposes of this example the throughput is a little higher than usual and it means you should take a look at how to more evenly distribute your application between your hosts and containers. If your throughput is very high during a time of service degradation, it could indicate that your application is processing more work than it can handle. On the other hand, low throughput could indicate that your app isn't handling very many requests. This could simply mean that it's not used very much or it could mean that a service upstream that calls to your application is broken and requests aren't being processed. 

In the gif below you see how to **expand** the throughput histogram to better compare trends between your service degradation and throughput.

### Investigate your transaction breakdown [#transaction-breakdown]

The transaction breakdown refers to the detailed breakdown of the time spent on each operation within a specific transaction. This breakdown helps developers understand the general performance of the transaction and identify bottlenecks or areas for improvement.

You can sort the transaction breakdown by **Category**, **% Time**, **Avg Calls/Txn**, and **Avg Time**. We recommend sorting by **% Time** to understand which piece of the transaction is taking up the most time within each transaction. 

Let's examine the sections of the **Breakdown table** in the screenshot below:

* **Category** refers to the type of call segment being monitored. 
* **Controller** is a type of **category** that refers to model-view-controller architecture and is most likely a call made directly from your UI to your application. 
* **External** is a type of **category** that represents a call being made that we began monitoring before we know where it's going.  
* **Middleware** is a type of **category** that most often refers to a dependency or library that is being used as part of your application's functionality. 
* **Segment** consists of the name of the function and call segment being monitored.
* **% Time** refers to the percentage of time each specific segment takes of the total transaction lifecycle. It's important to remember that some segments wait until all the other segments are completed before they're completed. In the screenshot below, the `Controller` segment is what is initiating the `POST` call, which means that all the other transactions are _nested_ within the `POST` call, which could be why it's taking longer than all the others. 
* **Avg Calls/Txn** is the amount of times that the segment is called per transaction during the time selected using the time picker. 
* **Avg Time** is the average time that a particular segment took to complete. It's important to keep in mind that there could be asynchronous work happening. One segment could be ongoing and then other, nested work, is being done at the same time. 

Once you sort the **Breakdown table**, you can click on any problematic segments.

<Step>
### Explore transaction traces [#transaction-traces]

When your customers are trying to purchase something on your site and they use the `Pay Now` button, the `Checkout-service` application generates multiple database queries, API calls, and other interactions with the underlying infrastructure. 

Transaction traces keep a record of every interaction between `Checkout-service` and your customers. 

Transaction traces can provide a wealth of information, including:

    * The time spent on each segment of a transaction, such as database queries, external API calls, or HTML renders.
    * The parameters passed to each segment of a transaction, allowing developers to identify specific data that may be causing issues.
    * Information about errors or exceptions that occurred during a transaction.
    * Information about the overall performance of the application, such as response times and throughput.

<Step>
### Take a look at trace details [#trace-details]

<img
    title="Trace details"
    alt="A screenshot showing trace details for a transaction trace"
    src={apmTraceDetails}
/>

</Step>
<Step>
And now you have all the information you need to fix the `Pay Now` button for your application. 

* You know which transaction is causing the service degradation of `Checkout-service`: `Sinatra/Rubytron/POST #purchaseCart`.
* You know when the problem started.
* You know which piece of the transaction is causing the breakdown in service: `Sinatra/Rubytron/POST`.

Your team can now start fixing the origin of the problem and get your checkout up-and-running as quickly as possible.
