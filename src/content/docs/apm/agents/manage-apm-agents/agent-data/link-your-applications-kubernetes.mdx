Agents can be configured to collect Kubernetes-related environment variables and add them to Transaction events to provide context between your Kubernetes cluster and your services. For details on the benefits see [this blog post](https://blog.newrelic.com/engineering/monitoring-application-performance-in-kubernetes/).

For more information on agent compatibility and installation instructions, see our [Kubernetes documentation](/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/metadata-injection/kubernetes-apm-metadata-injection).
