With real time streaming, your APM event data is sent to New Relic every five seconds. You can query and visualize your data for transactions, errors, and custom events in near real time. The smaller payloads result in faster chart refreshes and faster queries of data that is the most important to you.

For details on agents that support this feature, see [Agent versions](#enable).

Looking to stream your New Relic data to the cloud? See [Streaming data export](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-streaming-export).

## Why it matters [#benefits]

Real time streaming doesn't result in more events being sent. The combination of more frequent posts, with a smaller number of events per post, results in approximately the same number of events per minute as there would be without real time streaming.

The following image shows a comparison between data sent to New Relic with and without real time streaming. Note that 10,000 is an example number of events; some agents have lower default limits.

The overall limits on how many events can be sent per minute haven't changed. Also, non-event data (spans, traces, and metrics) are unaffected; they're still sent every minute.

Use real time streaming to quickly understand the impact when something has changed, such as deploying a new app version.

* Examine key performance indicators (throughput, error rates, charting, etc.) in near real time.
* Respond quickly to failure conditions and anomalies.
* Get the most out of our [dashboards](#create).
* Reduce mean time to detection with APM events reporting every five seconds.

## Query real time streaming data [#nrql]

When building charts, include the following in your NRQL query:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "250px" }}>
        NRQL clause
      </th>

      <th>
        Comments
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `SINCE 5 minutes ago`
      </td>

      <td>
        Be sure to add a [`SINCE 5 minutes ago` clause](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-components-functions#sel-since) to your NRQL query in order to take advantage of the 5 second chart refresh interval. This is because the [chart's refresh interval](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/insights-chart-refresh-intervals) is based on the time window.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `TIMESERIES` bucket
      </td>

      <td>
        To set the refresh interval for time series charts, you can also specify the bucket size as an optional argument to the [`TIMESERIES` clause](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-components-functions#sel-timeseries). For example, `SINCE 30 minutes ago TIMESERIES 5 seconds` will display a 30 minute window at a 5 second resolution. You can have a maximum of 366 buckets.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Create real time streaming charts [#create]

You can visualize the results of your NRQL query in through real time charts:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Query builder**.
2. Use the [Metrics & events explorer](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/browse-data/introduction-data-explorer) to start building a chart.
3. For applicable queries, hover over the query and click **Edit in query builder** to refine your query. 
4. In your NRQL query, adjust the [`SINCE` and `TIMESERIES` clauses](#nrql) to take advantage of the 5 second refresh intervals.

## Agent versions with this feature [#enable]

* **Go:** [v2.8.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/go-release-notes)
* **Java:** [v5.5.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/java-release-notes)
* **.NET:** [v8.23.107.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/net-release-notes)
* **Node.js:** [v5.13.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/nodejs-release-notes)
* **PHP:** [v9.5.0.252 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes)
* **Python:** [v5.2.0.127 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/python-release-notes)
* **Ruby:** [v6.7.0.359 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/ruby-release-notes)

<Callout variant="caution">
  If Transaction event reporting is [disabled](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-account-data/data-summary-page-manage-apps-reporting-insights#enable-disable), this can affect some UI elements throughout New Relic. You may see some empty charts on some UI pages that rely on this data.
