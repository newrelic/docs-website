## Problem

You need an easy way to get information about your application's configuration settings.

## Solution

If you do not want to view your configuration file itself, you can view the configuration settings in the APM UI, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM**</DNT>. Click your app, then click <DNT>**Settings > Environment > Agent initialization**</DNT>.
