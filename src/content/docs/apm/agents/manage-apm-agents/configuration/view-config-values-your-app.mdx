## Problem

You need an easy way to get information about your application's configuration settings.

## Solution

If you do not want to view your configuration file itself, you can view the configuration settings in the APM UI, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)** and click **APM**. Click your app, then click **Settings > Environment > Agent initialization**.
