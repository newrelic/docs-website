metaDescription: New Relic APM server-side config lets you manage some agent settings from the New Relic side, instead of the agent config file.

Server-side configuration transitions some core settings from your language agent's configuration file to the [New Relic collector](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#collector). Depending on the language agent, available settings may include:

* Transaction tracing
* SQL recording and logging
* SQL query plans
* Error collection
* Thread profiling
* Distributed tracing
* Cross application tracing
* Realtime profiling (Java agent only)

## Requirements [#requirements]

Server-side configuration is not available for our PHP agent.

## Centralization and security [#features]

Server-side configuration provides an easy way to manage the available settings from the New Relic server side. Centralized configuration settings can also help you ensure standards compliance and security management for your settings.

Any change to a monitored application automatically applies to all APM agents monitoring that application, even if they run across multiple hosts. The agent still follows the [local configurations](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/configuration/configure-agent) for any settings that can't be set .

## Server-side configuration precedence [#precedence]

This feature provides the convenience of managing the available configuration settings directly from the New Relic side, without the need for deployments or restarts. Available options to change settings, and the order of precedence they take when you use environment variables or other configuration options, will depend on the language agent used.

For more information about the hierarchy of settings, see the illustration for the specific agent:

* [Go hierarchy](/docs/agents/go-agent/instrumentation/go-agent-configuration#options)
* [Java hierarchy](/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file#config-options-precedence)
* [.NET hierarchy](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/net-agent-configuration#config-options-precedence)
* [Node.js hierarchy](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/configuring-nodejs#hierarchy)
* [PHP hierarchy](/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration#config-options-precedence) (server-side configuration not supported)
* [Python hierarchy](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-configuration#options)
* [Ruby hierarchy](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/installation-configuration/ruby-agent-configuration#Options)

## Configure from the UI [#enable-ssc]

The PHP agent doesn't support server-side configuration. To enable server-side configuration settings for monitored apps from the UI:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM**.
2. Click on your app. Then click **Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration**.

After you enable server-side configuration, you can view and change the available settings through the UI.

## Configure from NerdGraph API [#enable-nerdgraph]

For how to enable this with NerdGraph, see the [NerdGraph tutorial](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/apm-config-nerdgraph).

## View or change server-side configuration settings [#customize-ssc]

If you use server-side configuration, you must still include your `license_key` and `app_name` in the local config file. These settings are required for the agent to communicate with the New Relic collector.

The PHP agent doesn't support server-side configuration. To view or change the available server-side configuration settings through the UI for apps that use other New Relic agents:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM**.
2. Click on your app. Then click **Settings > Application > Server-side agent configuration**.

Once you set any of these options from the UI, they will override any conflicting options in the [agent's configuration file](#precedence).
