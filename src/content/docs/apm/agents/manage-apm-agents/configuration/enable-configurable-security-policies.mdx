<Callout variant="tip">
  APM's configurable security policies is available in **limited release** for approved New Relic accounts.

  If you are a New Relic customer and interested in the limited release of configurable security policies, contact your New Relic sales rep.
</Callout>

APM's configurable security policies gives you granular control over configuration options related to your account's data security. This document explains how to enable account-wide security policies and the options available.

For more information about New Relic's security measures, see our [security and privacy documentation](/docs/using-new-relic/new-relic-security/security/security-matters-data-privacy-new-relic), or visit the [New Relic security website](https://newrelic.com/security).

## Compatibility and requirements [#compatibility]

APM agent versions that support this feature include:

* C SDK: not available
* [Go](/docs/agents/go-agent/installation/install-new-relic-go): 2.1 or higher
* [Java](/docs/agents/java-agent/installation/upgrade-java-agent): 4.1 or higher
* [.NET](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation/update-net-agent): 8.1 or higher
* [Node.js](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/upgrade-nodejs-agent): 4.1 or higher
* [PHP](/docs/agents/php-agent/installation/upgrade-php-agent): 8.1 or higher
* Python: not available
* [Ruby](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/installation/upgrade-ruby-agent-versions): 5.2 or higher

## Enable configurable security policies [#activate]

<Callout variant="caution">
  Security policies apply account-wide. Once enabled, they can only be edited or disabled with the help of New Relic support.

  If [high security mode](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/configuration/high-security-mode) is enabled for the account(s), **do not disable it**. Account-level high security mode differs from your APM agent's high security mode, which is set in the configuration file.

  High security mode and configurable security policies do not apply to Lambda monitoring or use of the New Relic Event API.
</Callout>

For the limited release, there is no UI component.

If you are participating in the limited release, follow this procedure to set up your accounts:

1. Choose the accounts on which to enable configurable security policies.
2. Choose the [configurable security policies options](#options) that you want for those accounts.
3. Inform your New Relic sales rep of the options that you have chosen.
4. Ensure your [agent versions support this feature](#compatibility). Update agents if necessary.
5. When you receive the security token based on the security policies options that you chose, insert the security token into the agent configuration file(s). See [examples](#sample-file).
6. Delete the high security mode enabled flag from your config file(s).

High security mode (HSM) at the agent level is different than high security mode at the [account level](#account). Be sure to disable HSM in the agent's config file, as explained in this procedure. Having both the security token and the HSM flag will result in the agent disconnecting.

## Example configuration [#sample-file]

Here are some example configuration examples for enabling the configurable security policies:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="java"
    title="Java agent: YAML example"
  >
    The Java agent uses a [YAML file for configuration](/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file). Here is an example snippet enabling security policies:

    ```
    common: &default_settings
      license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY'
      app_name: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME'
      security_policies_token: 'YOUR_TOKEN'
    production:
      <<: *default_settings
      log_level: info
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="dot-net"
    title=".NET agent: XML example"
  >
    The .NET agent uses a [XML file for configuration](/docs/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration). Here is an example snippet enabling security policies:

    ```
    ...
    <configuration agentenabled="true" xmlns="urn:newrelic-config">
      <service licensekey="YOUR_LICENSE_KEY">
      <application>
        <name>YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME</name>
      </application>
      <securityPoliciesToken>YOUR_TOKEN</securityPoliciesToken>
      <log level="info">
    </log></service></configuration>
    ...
    ```

    If you prefer to use an environment variable, it would look like this:

    ```
    NEW_RELIC_SECURITY_POLICIES_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="ruby"
    title="Ruby agent: YAML example"
  >
    The Ruby agent uses a [YAML file for configuration](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/configuration/ruby-agent-configuration). Here is an example snippet enabling security policies:

    ```
    common: &default_settings
      license_key: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY'
      app_name: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME'
      security_policies_token: 'YOUR_TOKEN'
    production:
      <<: *default_settings
      log_level: info
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Available policy options [#options]

Here are the settings you can choose when creating your policies. Some of these options will not be available for some agents.

        * Disabled: Prevents the collection of obfuscated database query data.
