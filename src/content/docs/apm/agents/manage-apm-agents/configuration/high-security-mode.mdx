Our default APM agent settings provide a high level of security. However, you may need to guarantee that even if the default APM agent settings are overridden to be more permissive, no sensitive data will ever be reported to New Relic by the APM agent. If this is the case, then you'll want to turn on APM high-security mode (also known as enterprise security mode).

For more information about our default security measures, see our [security and privacy documentation](/docs/using-new-relic/new-relic-security/security/security-matters-data-privacy-new-relic), or visit the [New Relic security website](https://newrelic.com/security).

## Requirements [#requirements]

High-security mode requires [Enterprise edition](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/#editions).

High-security mode is a per-account setting, not a per-organization setting. This means that if your [organization contains multiple accounts](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/new-relic-account-structure), you must enable this mode for each account.

Have questions about access to this feature? Talk to your New Relic account representative.

## Versions [#overview]

There are two versions of high-security mode. [Version 1](#version1description) is deprecated and is available only if you already have it. If you're enabling high-security mode for the first time, the only option is version 2 (v2). For details about agent support for version 2, see [version support](#version-support).

## Enable high-security mode (version 2) [#version2enabled]

To enable high security, you must update both the local configuration on your server <DNT>**and**</DNT> the remote configuration in the UI.

Before you do this, note that:

* Once you enable high security for an account, <DNT>**high security cannot be turned off**</DNT> without assistance from [New Relic Support](https://support.newrelic.com).
* This is a [per-account setting](#requirements), meaning that you must set it for each account you want to grant high-security mode.

        * For users on [our newer user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-model) (almost all customers): Get the [account ID](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/account-id) for the account you want to enable. Then use that to go to this URL: `https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal/apm-agents/hsm?account=YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID`. On that page, you can configure high-security mode.
        * For users on [our original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model): Only the account owner can configure this. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**</DNT>, click the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings) and click on <DNT>**Administration**</DNT>. On that page, select <DNT>**High-security mode**</DNT>.

          If the agent is configured for high security via the UI but not locally, then the agent connections are rejected, and the agent will shut down. However, this won't shut down your application.

## Migrate from version 1 to version 2 [#migrating]

These are the main differences between the two versions of high security:

* In order to make high security even more secure, high security must be enabled in the New Relic user interface <DNT>**and**</DNT> in the local New Relic configuration file. High security v1 only required high security to be set in the New Relic UI.
* User attributes, `noticeError` attributes, and message queue parameters are turned off with high security in version 2, but not in version 1.

To update from v1 to v2, add `high_security: true` to your local agent configuration file.
