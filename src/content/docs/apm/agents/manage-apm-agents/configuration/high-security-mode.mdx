New Relic's default APM agent settings provide a high level of security. However, you may need to guarantee that even if the default APM agent settings are overridden to be more permissive, no sensitive data will ever be sent to New Relic. If this is the case, then you will want to turn on APM's high security mode (also known as enterprise security mode).

For more information about our security measures, see our [security and privacy documentation](/docs/using-new-relic/new-relic-security/security/security-matters-data-privacy-new-relic), or visit the [New Relic security website](https://newrelic.com/security).

## Requirements

Customers on our [usage-based pricing model](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing) require [Enterprise edition](https://newrelic.com/pricing). Customers on our original pricing model have access depending on their subscription level.

## Account level [#overview]

If you choose to turn on high security, you must enable high security for all applications reporting to the account. High security must be set on each individual account. For organizations that have a [parent/child account structure](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/mastersub-account-structure), child accounts don't automatically inherit the high security setting when enabled on the parent account.

Currently there are two versions of high security mode. [Version 1](#version1description) is deprecated and is only available if you already have it. If you are enabling high security mode for the first time, the only option is version 2 (v2).

## Enable high security mode (version 2) [#version2enabled]

To enable high security, you must update both the local configuration on your server **and** the remote configuration in the UI.

<Callout variant="caution">
  Once you enable high security for an account, **high security cannot be turned off** without assistance from [New Relic Support](https://support.newrelic.com).

        * For users on [our original user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-users-roles/users-roles-original-user-model): Only the account owner can configure this. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**, click the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings) and select **Account settings**. On that page, select **High security mode**.
        * For users on [our newer user model](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-changes-pricing-user-model/#user-model): Get the [account ID](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/account-id) for the account you want to enable. Then use that to go to this URL: `https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID`. On that page, you can configure high security mode.

          If the agent is configured for high security via the UI but not locally, then the agent connections are rejected, and the agent will shut down. However, this won't shut down your application.

## Migrate from version 1 to version 2 [#migrating]

These are the main differences between the two versions of high security:

* In order to make high security even more secure, high security must be enabled in the New Relic user interface **and** in the local New Relic configuration file. High security v1 only required high security to be set in the New Relic UI.
* User attributes, `noticeError` attributes, and message queue parameters are turned off with high security in version 2, but not in version 1.

To update from v1 to v2, add `high_security: true` to your local agent configuration file.
