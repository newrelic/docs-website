If you are an [Amazon AWS Elastic Beanstalk](http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/gsg/) user, the Java agent requires additional configuration.

## Prerequisites

Before completing the configuration, you must first:

* Create a supported [Amazon Web Services account](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/).
* Create a [New Relic account](http://newrelic.com/signup).
* [Download and install the Java agent](/docs/agents/java-agent/installation/java-agent-manual-installation).

To complete Java agent installation on AWS Elastic Beanstalk:

1. In your WAR file, add the `newrelic.jar` and `newrelic.yml` files to `WEB-INF/lib/`.
2. Repackage and deploy your new WAR file as a new application or an update to a previous application.
3. Locate and connect to the underlaying EC2 instance. Once connected, find the path to `newrelic.jar` file using this command - ensure you search one directory at a time. Use either `/var` or `/usr` as appropriate.

```
sudo find <var></var | /usr></var> -name "newrelic.jar"
```

## Pass -javaagent flag to JVM [#javaagent-flag]

To pass the `-javaagent` flag to JVM in AWS Elastic Beanstalk

1. In the AWS console, open the Elastic Beanstalk.
2. Select the relevant region.
3. Select your application.
4. In the left pane, select **Configurations**.
5. Open **Software Configuration**.
6. Under **Container Options**, add the following in the **JVM options** field:

   ```
   -javaagent:<var>/full/path/to/newrelic.jar</var>
   ```
7. Select **Apply** to save.

Your Elastic Beanstalk will then update your environment.
