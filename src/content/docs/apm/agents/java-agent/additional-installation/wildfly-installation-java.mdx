Before you install New Relic's Java agent, make sure your [WildFly version](/docs/agents/java-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-java-agent#app-web-servers) is supported. Depending on which WildFly version your application uses, additional configuration steps may be required.

## Install WildFly versions earlier than 11 [#wildfly-pre-11]

If your supported WildFly version is earlier than v11, follow [standard Java installation procedures](/docs/agents/java-agent/installation/install-java-agent). You **do not** need to do any additional configuration.

## Install WildFly version 11 or higher [#wildfly-11]

If you use [WildFly version 11 or higher](http://wildfly.org/), New Relic's Java agent requires additional configuration after you install it.

1. [Install the Java agent](/docs/agents/java-agent/installation/install-java-agent). If you already have it installed, [update](/docs/agents/java-agent/installation/update-java-agent#procedures) to the [latest Java agent](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/java-release-notes) version. Versions [5.0.0](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/java-release-notes/java-agent-500) and higher include fixes for later WildFly versions 11 and higher.
2. Open the `standalone` configuration file appropriate for your operating system and [add the -javaagent property](/docs/agents/java-agent/installation/install-java-agent) to `JAVA_OPTS`. For example, if you use Linux, edit the `/bin/standalone.conf` file or `/bin/standalone.conf.bat` for Windows.
3. Make sure the agent `jar` is visible to all JBoss modules by adding `com.newrelic` to the JBoss modules system packages using either of these options in the `standalone` script:

   * **Recommended: Option 1** (same as adding `-javaagent` property):

     ```
     JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -Djboss.modules.system.pkgs=$JBOSS_MODULES_SYSTEM_PKGS,com.newrelic"
     ```
   * **Option 2:**

     ```
     if [ "x$JBOSS_MODULES_SYSTEM_PKGS" = "x" ]; then
     JBOSS_MODULES_SYSTEM_PKGS="org.jboss.byteman,com.newrelic"
     fi
     ```
4. Restart your application server.
