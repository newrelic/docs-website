If you're a WebLogic or WebSphere user and use the Java 2 security model, our Java agent requires configuration in addition to the [Java agent installation](/install/java).

## WebLogic: Java 2 Security [#weblogic-java-2]

If you're using Java 2 security, add the following entry to `weblogic.policy` to complete installation:

```
grant codeBase "file:YOUR_FULL_PATH_TO_FILE/newrelic/-" {
    permission java.security.AllPermission;
  };
```

Specify the directory containing `newrelic.jar` in `/full/path/to/newrelic`. The default policy file location is `weblogic_root/server/lib/weblogic.policy`.

## WebSphere: Java 2 Security or Administrative Security [#websphere-java-2]

If you are using Java 2 Security or WebSphere Admin Security, you must grant all jars inside the New Relic install folder the proper permissions. 

To enable New Relic for all app servers, edit the `java.policy` file:

1. Open your `java.policy` file, located inside your WebSphere install directory at:

    ```
    YOUR_WEBSPHERE_INSTALL_DIRECTORY/java/jre/lib/security/java.policy
    ```
2. Append the following text to your policy file, customizing the `file:` path to point to the folder containing `newrelic.jar`. Ensure you preserve the dash `-` at the end of the path, which grants all jars in the target folder the necessary permissions.

    ```
    grant codeBase "file:/YOUR_FULL_PATH_TO_NEW_RELIC_FOLDER/-" {
          permission java.security.AllPermission;
          permission java.net.NetPermission "specifyStreamHandler";
          permission java.net.SocketPermission "*.newrelic.com", "connect,accept,resolve";
    };
    ```

    <Callout variant="important">
      The `codeBase` value must use slashes, not backslashes, as the directory separator, even on Windows systems.
    </Callout>
3. Restart your application server.

<Callout variant="tip">
  For each app, Java security permissions are determined by the union of `java.policy` and `server.policy`. Do not put the same permission settings in multiple files.
</Callout>
