## Problem

The [log data](/docs/agents/java-agent/troubleshooting/generate-debug-logs-troubleshooting-java) for your Java app shows failures to connect to New Relic. You want to verify if the `INFO` messages are due to traffic connectivity or firewall rules, or if they are due to more serious issues.

## Solution

Occasional failures to connect to the [New Relic collector](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#collector) should not be a cause for concern. These failures should not affect the performance metrics available in your app's New Relic user interface.

New Relic's Java agent attempts to connect about once a minute. To troubleshoot the problem:

1. Search your log files for [`INFO` messages about connection failures](#info-messages).
2. Check [how frequently the messages appear](#message-frequency).

For example, look for messages such as:

```
Jul 31, 2017 21:37:14 +0000 NewRelic 10
INFO: Failed to connect to collector.newrelic.com.:443 for My Application:java.net.
ConnectException: Connection refused:connect
```

or

```
Jul 31, 2017 21:37:14 +0000 NewRelic 40
INFO: The data collector is temporarily unavailable.
This can happen periodically. In the event that availability of our servers 
is not restored after a period of time, 
then please report this to New Relic.
java.net.SocketException: Connection reset
```

Depending on how frequently the message appears, do the following to troubleshoot the problem:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        **Frequency of INFO message**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Comments**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        A few minutes
      </td>

      <td>
        New Relic's Java agent can cache a significant amount of metric data when it cannot connect. Even if the outage lasts a few minutes, in general, this will not result in any loss of information in the APM UI. You can safely ignore these messages.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Intermittently over a few days
      </td>

      <td>
        Intermittent connection issues can occasionally cause many of these messages in a short time. If this occurs only once every few days, and all your app data appears in the New Relic UI, you can safely ignore these messages.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Every minute for several minutes
      </td>

      <td>
        If failures occur every minute for more than a few minutes, then the Java agent is not able to receive data from your app, and no data can be reported. In this situation:

        1. Verify whether New Relic is experiencing availability problems: Check New Relic's status at [status.newrelic.com](https://status.newrelic.com).
        2. If New Relic is not reporting any issues, [gather troubleshooting information](/docs/agents/java-agent/troubleshooting/gather-troubleshooting-information-java) for your app.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Cause

Despite the log text, this error generally is caused by a failure of connectivity or firewalled traffic rather than the New Relic collector actually being unavailable. For more information, see the lists of [IP ranges](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/networks) used by all of New Relic's services.
