## Problem

If your [log data](/docs/agents/java-agent/troubleshooting/no-log-file-java) shows `SEVERE:` or `ERROR:` with `NullPointerException` issues, there may be issues that are interfering with reporting.

## Solution

Before you begin these troubleshooting tips, make sure you have the [most recent version](/docs/agents/java-agent/installation/upgrade-java-agent) of New Relic's Java agent.

1. Use case-sensitive searches of your Java agent log file for lines with `SEVERE:` and `ERROR: NullPointerException`.
2. If you find any lines with these messages, [gather troubleshooting information](/docs/agents/java-agent/troubleshooting/providing-troubleshooting-information-java) to get support at New Relic.

## Cause

New Relic's Java agent between versions 3.0.0 and 3.2.3 would incorrectly log the error messages. For example:

```
ERROR: javax/servlet/ServletOutputStream is marked as a weaved class, but no methods are matched to be weaved.
```

This was entirely erroneous and is not a cause for concern. However, do not use these versions. Instead, update to the [most recent version](/docs/agents/java-agent/installation/upgrade-java-agent) of New Relic's Java agent.
