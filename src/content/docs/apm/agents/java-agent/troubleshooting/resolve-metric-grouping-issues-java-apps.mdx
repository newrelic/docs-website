## Problem

Your app uses New Relic's Java agent and you run into a [metric grouping issue](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/metric-grouping-issues).

## Solution

Try these troubleshooting procedures before metric grouping issues become too big of a problem.

    By default, the Java agent [names transactions](/docs/agents/java-agent/instrumentation/naming-web-transactions) based on your framework and the various components of your application. However, if the Java agent is configured to disable component-based naming, it will not be able to properly name those transactions. This will often lead to a metric grouping issue.

    To troubleshoot your Java agent configuration: If [component-based naming](/docs/agents/java-agent/instrumentation/naming-web-transactions#reverting) has been disabled, re-enable it.

    Some metric grouping issues can be resolved simply by [upgrading your New Relic agent](/docs/agents/java-agent/installation/upgrade-java-agent). Unless you have a good reason not to, New Relic recommends always upgrading to the most recent version.

    To troubleshoot your Java agent version, refer to the [Java agent release notes](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/java-release-notes). The release notes summarize fixes and changes, including situations where agent-related metric grouping issues have been corrected.

    If your Java agent version is up to date and correctly configured, but you still run into a metric grouping issue, you may need to [manually name your transactions](/docs/agents/java-agent/instrumentation/naming-web-transactions). To help you get started, refer to New Relic's [example program using the Java API](/docs/agents/java-agent/custom-instrumentation/java-agent-api-example-program).

    The [Java agent API](/docs/agents/java-agent/custom-instrumentation/java-agent-api) allows you to [set a transaction name](http://newrelic.github.io/java-agent-api/javadoc/com/newrelic/api/agent/NewRelic.html#setTransactionName%28java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String%29) within your application. This helps eliminate unique names and IDs in metric names.

  <Collapser
    id="resolve-limit"
    title="Resolve metric limit placed by New Relic"
  >
    After detecting a metric grouping issue, New Relic automatically applies a metric limit to your app. This prevents new metric names from coming into your app.

    The metric limit prevents the problem from getting any worse. However, before New Relic can remove the limit, the cause of the metric grouping issue must be resolved.

    Once the underlying problem has been managed, [New Relic Support](https://support.newrelic.com) will check your application to make sure that:

    * Your upgraded Java agent no longer sends the older metrics that were causing grouping issues.
    * Your new [transaction names](/docs/agents/java-agent/instrumentation/naming-web-transactions) properly exclude the unique portions of the name.

    After confirming that the metric grouping issue is resolved, New Relic Support will manually update your application so that new metric names will once again be allowed.
