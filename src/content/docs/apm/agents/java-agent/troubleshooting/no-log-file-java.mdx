## Problem

Your New Relic Java agent is not generating log files.

## Solution

Ensure your New Relic Java agent is configured to generate `newrelic_agent.log` files by checking the following:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="no-log-file"
    title="Log file directory"
  >
    New Relic's Java agent stores log files in the `logs` directory. The Java agent creates this directory in the same location used for the `newrelic.jar` in the `-javaagent` switch. If you cannot find `newrelic_agent.log`, ensure the JVM process has permissions to write to the `logs` directory.

    Permissions management varies greatly by environment, so work with your system administrator to verify that this is not an issue. If permissions are not the issue, check that you did not customize the location of the `logs` directory.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      You can specify a different directory and name with the `log_file_path` and `log_file_name` settings.
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="config"
    title="Config file"
  >
    Ensure that the YAML format in `newrelic.yml` is valid by using a [YAML validator](http://yamllint.com/). This tool verifies that your YAML is valid. It also gives you an interpreted version uncluttered by comments.

    If your YAML is not valid, use an editor that keeps spaces on lines, such as Sublime Text. This will help you make changes to your `newrelic.yml` with the correct number of spaces.

  <Collapser
    id="bootlog"
    title="Boot log"
  >
    You can start up your app server so that it prints to the console. Here are some examples of where this is stored:

    * **JBoss**: `log/boot.log`
    * **Glassfish**: `domain-dir/logs/server.log`
    * **Tomcat**: `catalina.out` (if specified in `catalina.sh`) or `catalina.bat`
    * **WebLogic**:[`server_name.log`](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17904_01/web.1111/e13739/logging_services.htm#i1179712)
    * **WebObjects**: `/var/log/webobjects.log`

      When booting your JVM, verify that the generated logs show that the `newrelic.jar` file opened and that the Java agent interpreted the `newrelic.yml` configuration file. Failures to find either file or open them correctly will appear in the logs.

      Successfully loading the agent will look something like this:

      ```
      Aug 29, 2017 15:02:49 -0700 NewRelic 1 INFO: Agent is using Logback
      Aug 29, 2017 15:02:49 -0700 NewRelic 1 INFO: Loading configuration file
      "/path/on/your/host/newrelic/.newrelic.yml"
      ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>
