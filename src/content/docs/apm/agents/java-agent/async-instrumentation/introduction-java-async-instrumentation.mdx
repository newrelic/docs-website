[New Relic for Java](/docs/agents/java-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-java) includes a [set of API methods](/docs/agents/java-agent/java-agent-api/java-agent-api-asynchronous-applications) for custom instrumentation of asynchronous activity. This is most useful to instrument asynchronous activity in [unsupported frameworks](/docs/agents/java-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-java-agent#frameworks), but you can also use the API to add additional instrumentation to supported frameworks. This document explains how asynchronous activity occurs, and how New Relic monitors async work.

## Asynchronous operations [#h2_asynchronous_basics]

With a **synchronous** programming model, programming tasks are usually executed in a specific order. One task must complete before the next task begins, and each task blocks the next task from completing.

**Asynchronous** programming uses a non-blocking model, so that tasks can be run in parallel. Tasks executed asynchronously are completely independent of each other in their execution and initialization. Because asynchronous code doesn't execute in a specific order, the server's full processing power can be used more efficiently, and the app's throughput increases.

## Async and thread-switching [#thread_switching]

For applications that use asynchronous processing, **thread-switching** is when a program or task switches from one thread to another. Understanding these asynchronous interleavings can help you decide which methods should be instrumented.

Here is an example method with a controller that makes external requests in parallel. These requests execute asynchronously, so each request executes independently of each other and `getScoreAsync()` returns immediately after being called. This allows the requesting thread to continue making requests while `getScoreAsync()` makes an external call and sends a reply.

```
@ResponseBody
@RequestMapping("getScores", method = RequestMethod.Get
   produces = “text/plain”)
public String getCreditScores(@RequestParam(name = "uids") uids) {
     return Arrays.stream(uids.split(","))
                .parallel()
                .map(Integer::valueOf)
                .map(uid -> getScoreAsync(uid))
                .collect(Collectors.toList());}
```

Some of these requests will finish before others. Some might even finish after the requesting thread has moved on to other tasks:

With New Relic's asynchronous instrumentation, the APM UI flags the work as **Async**. For example, if the above method were instrumented by New Relic (either automatically or via custom instrumentation), this is what the APM UI would show on the [**Trace details** page](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/transaction-trace-details):

## Async and response time [#response_time]

**Response time** is defined as the duration of a transaction from the perspective of the requester. For asynchronous applications, the response time is often less than the total transaction time. This is because the methods do not have to wait for all preceding methods to complete before returning. Because tasks can be deferred, the application can take advantage of its limited resources and process things more quickly.

The chart's response time line gives you more insight into the perceived behavior and speed of your application than does the total web transaction time:

This is because the methods do not have to wait for all preceding methods to complete before returning.

## Custom instrumentation with the async API [#async-api]

To implement custom instrumentation of async work, see the [Java agent async API guide](/docs/agents/java-agent/java-agent-api/java-agent-asynchronous-api-guide). For general information on how to use the Java agent API, see [Java agent API guide](/docs/agents/java-agent/custom-instrumentation/java-agent-api-guide).
