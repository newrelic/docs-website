To remove the Java agent:

1. Delete the `newrelic` folder from your app server's root directory.
2. Remove the [JVM argument](/docs/agents/java-agent/installation/include-java-agent-jvm-argument) you used to include the agent in your startup script.
3. If applicable, rename your backed-up start script to its original name.
4. After you complete these steps, [restart](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/uninstall-agent#restart) your app.
