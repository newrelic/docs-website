New Relic's Java agent 3.9.0 or higher supports both the [Java Message Service (JMS) 1.1 API](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/jms/package-summary.html#package.description) and the [RabbitMQ Java client library](https://www.rabbitmq.com/java-client.html). This gives you insights into the performance of your message processing, for both incoming and outgoing messages.

The APM UI will show transactions initiated via JMS 1.1 or RabbitMQ message receipt as **Message** background tasks. Message creation via JMS or RabbitMQ also appears in transaction traces.

## Performance improvements with background tasks [#background]

One way to increase responsiveness of web applications is to delegate work to background processes. Message queues are commonly used for this inter-process communication.

In the context of message queuing systems, applications typically interact with message brokers to send and receive messages. The RabbitMQ Java client library allows Java applications to interface with message brokers that implement the Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP) 0.9.

New Relic's Java agent shows messages sent and received using the RabbitMQ client library and JMS. With this visibility, you can see details including:

* Number of messages handled by your app
* Time your app spends publishing messages
* Time your app spends processing "dequeued" messages

[APM's](#view-queue) conveniently group and report operations that interact with temporary queues. By analyzing this information, you can more easily identify areas where processes take too much time and may be handled better as background messages.

## Installation requirements [#installation]

To monitor your RabbitMQ client activity, make sure you have downloaded and installed New Relic's [Java agent version 3.9.0 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/java-release-notes).

To monitor JMS, make sure you have downloaded and installed New Relic's [Java agent version 3.3.1 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/java-release-notes/java-agent-331).

<Callout variant="tip">
  For additional monitoring of your RabbitMQ systems, use the [free RabbitMQ plugin for New Relic](http://newrelic.com/plugins/pivotal/95). This plugin is published and supported by Pivotal, the corporate parents of RabbitMQ.

## Queue operations [#queue-ops]

Supported entry points for queue operations appear as `Put` (publish a message) or `Take` (receive a message) in APM's user interface.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={150}>
        **Queue operations**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Publish a message (`Put` in UI)**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Receive a message (`Take` in UI)**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        RabbitMQ
      </td>

      <td>
        `basicPublish`
      </td>

      <td>
        `basicGet`, `nextDelivery`, and `handleDelivery`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        JMS
      </td>

      <td>
        `send`
      </td>

      <td>
        `receive`, `receiveNoWait`, and `onMessage`
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## View message queue operations [#view-queue]

Queue operations appear in APM's [**Transactions** page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/transactions-dashboard) for the selected app. The `Put` and `Take` metrics appear in the **Breakdown table** and are categorized as `MessageBroker` metrics. Here is an example.

<figcaption>
  **APM > Applications > (selected app) > Monitor >Transactions > (selected transaction):** The transaction’s **Breakdown table** categorizes queue operations as `MessageBroker` metrics and labels them as `Put` (publish a message) or `Take` (receive a message).
</figcaption>

[Transaction traces](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/transaction-traces) also may provide additional details.

<Callout variant="tip">
  You can [select transaction traces](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/viewing-transaction-traces) from the app's **Summary** or **Transactions** pages in APM.
</Callout>

The [**Transaction trace summary** page](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/transaction-trace-summary) also may show `Put` and `Take` operations in the **Slowest components** section. For example:

![New Relic Java rabbitmq transaction summary](./images/screen-rabbitmq-trace-slowest.png "screen-rabbitmq-trace-slowest.png")

<figcaption>
  **APM > Applications > (selected app) > Monitor > Summary > (selected transaction trace):** In this example, the selected transaction trace's **Summary** shows RabbitMQ operations in the colored bar chart. The **Slowest components** section also lists the RabbitMQ `Put` and `Take` results.
</figcaption>

The **Transaction trace** page also may include a dedicated **Messages** tab. Here is an example.

![New Relic Java rabbitmq messages](./images/screen-rabbitmq-messages.png "screen-rabbitmq-messages.png")

<figcaption>
  **APM > Applications > (selected app) > Monitor > Summary > (selected transaction trace):** In this example, the selected transaction trace's **Messages** tab lists the RabbitMQ message details.
