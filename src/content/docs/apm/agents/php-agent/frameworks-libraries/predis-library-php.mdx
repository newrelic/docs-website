New Relic added support for the Predis library in PHP agent [release 4.22](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes/php-agent-422099).

The agent instruments standard calls to a `Predis\Client` object or to a pipeline. Any commands sent via a pipeline will be grouped and treated as a single command metric named `pipeline` rather than the individual commands.

The PHP agent does not support calls to the `executeRaw` or `transaction` methods, PubSub, monitor, or similar. These will not be instrumented.
