The New Relic PHP agent has added support for Laravel Horizon in the 12.2.0.27 release. Laravel Horizon is supported for Laravel 10 and above.

## Configuration

For Laravel Horizon and other long-lived queue worker processes, it is recommended to set the [newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration/#inivar-daemon-app_connect_timeout)
INI setting to 5s:

```ini
newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout = 5s
```

Increasing this value ensures the daemon has enough time to connect to the backend during startup. It is also important to note that this value can vary based on network conditions, which could require a higher timeout value.

## Disabling queue instrumentation

Queue instrumentation is enabled by default. If for any reason you would like to disable queue instrumentation, you would add the following line to your `newrelic.ini` file:

```ini
newrelic.special = disable_laravel_queue
```
