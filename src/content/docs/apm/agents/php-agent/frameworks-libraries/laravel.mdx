The New Relic PHP agent provides automatic instrumentation for Laravel web transactions and background transactions initiated by Laravel Queue Workers. Starting with PHP agent version 12.2.0.27, automatic instrumentation also supports background transactions initiated by Laravel Horizon Workers.

## Configuration Recommendations for Laravel Horizon/Queue Support

For Laravel Horizon and Laravel Queue, set the [newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration/#inivar-daemon-app_connect_timeout)
INI setting to 5s:
INI setting to 5s:

```ini
newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout = 5s
```

Increasing this value ensures the daemon has enough time to connect to the backend when long-lived worker processes start. Network conditions might require an even higher timeout value. Configure this setting only for worker processes, because increasing the timeout can negatively impact web transaction latency.

## Disabling Queue Instrumentation

Queue instrumentation is enabled by default. To disable it, add the following line to your `newrelic.ini` file:

```ini
newrelic.special = disable_laravel_queue
```
