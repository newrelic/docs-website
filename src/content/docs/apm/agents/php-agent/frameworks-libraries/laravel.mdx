The New Relic PHP agent provides support for Laravel and has added support for Laravel Horizon in the 12.2.0.27 release. Laravel Horizon is supported for Laravel 10 and above.

## Laravel Horizon/Laravel Queue Support

For Laravel Horizon and Laravel Queue, it is recommended to set the [newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration/#inivar-daemon-app_connect_timeout)
INI setting to 5s:

```ini
newrelic.daemon.app_connect_timeout = 5s
```

Increasing this value ensures the daemon has enough time to connect to the backend when long-lived worker processes start. Additionally, this value can vary based on network conditions, which could require a higher timeout value. It is also important to note that this setting should only be modified for worker processes, as increasing the timeout may negatively impact latency of web transactions.

## Disabling Queue Instrumentation

Queue instrumentation is enabled by default. If for any reason you would like to disable queue instrumentation, you would add the following line to your `newrelic.ini` file:

```ini
newrelic.special = disable_laravel_queue
```
