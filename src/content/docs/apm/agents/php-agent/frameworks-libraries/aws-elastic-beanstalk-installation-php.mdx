AWS [Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk) is a dynamic service that allows easy deployment and scalability for your PHP applications. Follow these instructions to install AWS with New Relic's PHP agent.

## Requirements

Before you install New Relic's PHP agent, make sure you have a supported [Amazon Web Services account](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/ "Link opens in a new window"). In addition, for any New Relic installation, you will need your New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey"/>. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you [sign up](http://newrelic.com/signup "Link opens in a new window") for your account.

## Installation

To install New Relic's PHP agent on AWS Elastic Beanstalk:

1. In the `.ebextensions` folder inside your Elastic BeanStalk application, create a new file named `newrelic.config`.
2. Add the following content to the file:

   ```yml
   packages:
     yum:
       newrelic-php5: []
     rpm:
       newrelic: INSERT_LINK_TO_REPO
   commands:
     configure_new_relic:
       command: newrelic-install install
       env:
         NR_INSTALL_SILENT: true
         NR_INSTALL_KEY: INSERT_LICENSE_KEY
   ```
3. Replace `INSERT_LINK_TO_REPO` with the appropriate repository URL.

   * For 32-bit systems, use `http://yum.newrelic.com/pub/newrelic/el5/i386/newrelic-repo-5-3.noarch.rpm`
   * For 64-bit systems, use `http://yum.newrelic.com/pub/newrelic/el5/x86_64/newrelic-repo-5-3.noarch.rpm`
4. Replace `INSERT_LICENSE_KEY` with your New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey"/>.
5. Push your app to Elastic BeanStalk:

   * In general, use [`eb deploy`](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb3-deploy.html).
   * If you are still using [Eb CLI 2.6](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli.html) , use `git aws.push` if required.

After a successful setup, it can take up to fifteen minutes before metrics begin to appear in New Relic.
