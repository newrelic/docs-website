New Relic supports versions 5, 6 and 7 of the <DNT>**Guzzle HTTP client library**</DNT>.

The Guzzle library allows both sequential and parallel requests. This page describes how each type of request will appear in the [<DNT>**Summary**</DNT> page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page) in the New Relic UI. To discover which call was the slowest, view the [External Services page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/external-services-page) which displays timing for individual external calls.

## Sequential requests [#more_help]

This PHP code makes multiple sequential requests with Guzzle:

```php
$client = new \GuzzleHttp\Client;
$response = $client->get('http://YOUR_SITE.com/api/foo');
$client->delete('http://YOUR_SITE.com/api/foo/'.$response->getBody());
```

This code would appear in the New Relic UI as:

</figcaption>

[Response time](/docs/data-analysis/user-interface-functions/response-time) is shown as the dark blue line. The green <DNT>**web external time**</DNT> represents time spent in the Guzzle library. Because the requests were made sequentially, the response time is <DNT>**equal**</DNT> to the [total time](/docs/data-analysis/user-interface-functions/response-time#response-time-total-time) spent in PHP, MySQL, and web external activities.

## Parallel requests [#more_help]

This PHP code makes multiple requests in parallel by unwrapping an array of promises:

```php
$client = new \GuzzleHttp\Client;

$promises = [
    $client->getAsync('http://YOUR_SITE.com/api/foo'),
    $client->getAsync('http://YOUR_SITE.com/api/bar'),
    $client->getAsync('http://YOUR_SITE.com/api/quux'),
];

\GuzzleHttp\Promise\unwrap($promises);
```

This code would appear in the New Relic UI as:

<img
  title="Parallel requests with Guzzle"
  alt="Parallel requests with Guzzle"
  src="/images/apm_screenshot-crop_guzzle-parallel.webp"
/>

<figcaption>
  <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services > (select an app) > Summary > Web transactions time**</DNT>: Parallel requests with Guzzle in the New Relic UI
</figcaption>

The green <DNT>**web external time**</DNT> represents time spent in the Guzzle library. Because the requests were performed asynchronously, the [total time](/docs/data-analysis/user-interface-functions/response-time#response-time-total-time) spent in PHP, MySQL, and web external is <DNT>**greater**</DNT> than the response time.

## Timing with Guzzle 6 and 7 [#timing]

Unlike previous versions, Guzzle 6 and 7 do not generate an event when a request is sent. Instead, the agent begins timing a request when the request object is created. If a request object is created and additional work is done before sending, New Relic may report that the request took longer than it actually did.

## Disable Guzzle support

To disable Guzzle support:

1. Add `newrelic.guzzle.enabled = false` to your `newrelic.ini` file.
2. [Restart your web server](/docs/agents/php-agent/troubleshooting/why-when-restart-your-web-server-php) (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.).
