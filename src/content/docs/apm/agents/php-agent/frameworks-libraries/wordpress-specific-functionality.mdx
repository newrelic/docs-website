If you [install New Relic for WordPress websites](/docs/agents/php-agent/installation/install-php-agent-shared-hosting-service), the PHP agent receives additional metrics. A **WordPress** page appears in the New Relic user interface: Go to [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com/) **> APM > (select a WordPress app)**.

## Configuration

You can control which WordPress-specific metrics your app sends to New Relic by using the PHP agent's `ini` setting `newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks`. This is enabled by default in versions **5.3** or higher, and it can be disabled with:

```
newrelic.framework.wordpress.hooks = false
```

Although this setting uses the word `.hooks`, it controls all WordPress metrics sent to New Relic, including hooks, plugins, and themes.

## Metrics

The PHP agent receives metrics for the following:

* **Hooks**: These metrics indicate time spent within each WordPress hook. Time is calculated from the hook dispatch functions `apply_filters`, `apply_filters_ref_array`, `do_action`, and `do_action_ref_array`.
* **Plugins and themes**: These metrics indicate time spent within each WordPress plugin and theme. Time is calculated from the dispatch functions for hooks.

## Integration with New Relic partners [#integration]

By integrating your WordPress application with APM, you can view performance directly from your WordPress app's **Administration** page. For example, [W3 Total Cache](http://newrelic.com/connect/details#w3-total-cache) is one of New Relic's [Connect partners](/docs/new-relic-partnerships/partner-integration-guide/new-relic-products-features/new-relic-connect) that specializes in WordPress apps.

## WordPress plugin for browser monitoring [#browser]

Signing up for a New Relic account and adding [browser monitoring](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-browser) to your WordPress site is fast and easy with the [browser monitoring plugin for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rt-newrelic-browser/). The plugin and our browser monitoring do not require the special access required to install our PHP agent.

This makes them generally compatible with **all** WordPress hosting providers. In addition, the WordPress plugin is supported by the authors and the WordPress community.
