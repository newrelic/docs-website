Before you [install the PHP agent](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/installation), make sure your system meets the version requirements listed below.


## PHP releases [#php-release]

The following PHP versions are supported:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th style={{ width: "250px" }}>
                Version
            </th>
            <th>
                Compatibility notes
            </th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                7.0 - 7.4
            </td>
            <td>
              Support for PHP versions 7.0 and 7.1 will **EOL** June 1st, 2024.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                8.0 - 8.3
            </td>
            <td>
                When PHP 8.x detects an observability extension (the PHP agent),  [Just-In-Time compilation](https://php.watch/articles/jit-in-depth) is disabled.

                PHP 8.1 and later does not support [Fibers](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.fibers.php).
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table> 

## PHP agent compatibility

See [PHP agent release notes](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes/) for the latest PHP agent release.

  * For PHP builds that are compiled with Zend Thread Safety (ZTS), only [PHP agent 9.19](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes/php-agent-9190309) and earlier support these builds.
  * If you're using an unsupported PHP version or platform (such as a 32 bit OS, FreeBSD, or ZTS builds), we recommend disabling the auto-update mechanisms for the PHP agent packages. If you fail to prevent automatic upgrades, this could lead to the accidental installation of a newer agent version. The newer version may no longer support critical features essential for APM data collection, resulting in disruptions to monitoring capabilities.
  
    To disable auto-update, you have two options: 
      * Add the PHP agent packages to an exclusion list for package upgrades, or
      * Version pin the PHP agent package to an agent version that supports the old, unsupported feature(s). The affected PHP agent packages are:
        * `newrelic-php5`
        * `newrelic-php5-common`
        * `newrelic-daemon`


## Permissions [#permissions]

Installing the PHP agent **requires** root access to:

* Read/write access to the PHP extensions directory.
* Read/write access to PHP configuration data, either in the PHP configuration directory (preferred) or in `php.ini`.
* Restart the web server or PHP process pool.

Running the agent **does not require** root access. The agent does need read/write access to the following files (the location of these files can be [customized in the PHP agent settings](/docs/php/php-agent-phpini-settings)):

* [A file storing the agent log files](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration/#inivar-daemon-logfile)
* [A file storing the agent socket endpoint](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration/#inivar-daemon-port)
* [A file storing the agent process ID](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration/#inivar-daemon-pidfile)

## License key [#license_key]

Your New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you [sign up](https://newrelic.com/signup) for your account. For more information, see the PHP [install script](/docs/php/the-newrelic-install-script) or [license key settings in the PHP `ini` file](/docs/php/php-agent-phpini-settings#inivar-license).

## Processors [#processor]

The following processors are supported:

* Intel (and compatible) platforms
* ARM64

## Operating systems [#operating-systems]

When vendors announce end of life (such as on [Ubunto's End of Standard Support page](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases)), we will continue to support those latest versions for one year. However, if the PHP version you're using is no longer officially supported, then support could end sooner than one year. 

This is why we recommend always using the latest version of the OS that is officially supported by the vendor.
The latest versions of our agent may work on OS versions that are past End of Life, but we no longer test or officially support the PHP agent with older versions.

The PHP agent supports the operating systems listed in the table below.

## Other third-party monitoring software [#other-monitoring-software]

If your application uses any additional monitoring software, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and cannot offer technical support. For more information, see [Errors when using other monitoring software](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/troubleshooting/errors-while-using-new-relic-apm-alongside-other-apm-software).

## Instance details

New Relic collects [instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers](/docs/apm/applications-menu/features/analyze-database-instance-level-performance-issues). The following databases and extensions are supported:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Database
      </th>

      <th>
        Extension
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        MongoDB
      </td>

      <td>
        [mongodb](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-library)
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        MySQL
      </td>

    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
      </td>

      <td>
        * [pgsql](http://php.net/manual/en/book.pgsql.php)
        * [pdo_pgsql](http://php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-pgsql.php)
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

To disable collection of host information, configure one of the following in the `newrelic.ini`file:
* Disable instance reporting with `newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled = false`
* Omit the database name with `newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false`

To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your PHP agent, get support at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com).

## Message queuing [#queuing]

The following supports message queuing:

* HTTP
* Laravel queuing

## Security requirements [#security]

As a standard [security measure for data collection](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/security/data-security), your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported.

## New Relic feature support [#digital-intelligence-platform]

The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Product
      </th>

      <th>
        Integration
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        [Browser monitoring](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-browser)
      </td>

      <td>
        The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you [enable auto-instrumentation](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation/install-new-relic-browser-agent#select-apm-app). After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the [APM Summary page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page) and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see [Browser monitoring and the PHP agent](/docs/agents/php-agent/features/page-load-timing-php).

      <td>
        [Codestream (code-level metrics)](/docs/codestream/how-use-codestream/performance-monitoring/)
      </td>

      <td>
        New Relic CodeStream brings observability into the IDE to show how your code is performing in production at the method level.

        PHP versions 7.0 - 7.4 and 8.0 - 8.3 report code-level metrics (starting with release 10.4.0).

    <tr>
      <td>
        [Infrastructure monitoring](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-infrastructure)
      </td>

      <td>
        When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your hosts by APM app in the infrastructure UI. For more information, see [APM data in infrastructure monitoring](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/data-instrumentation/new-relic-apm-data-infrastructure).
