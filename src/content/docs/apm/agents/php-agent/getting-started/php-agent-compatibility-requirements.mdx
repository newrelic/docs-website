Before you [install](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/installation) New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements.

If you don't have one already, [create a New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup). It's free, forever.

## PHP releases [#php-release]



New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 8.0, 8.1 and 8.2.

<Callout variant="important">
  Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0, 8.1 or 8.2 detects an observability extension, like the New Relic agent, PHP disables Just-In-Time compilation.

  Support for PHP 8.1 and 8.2 does not include Fibers.

  Support for PHP versions 5.5 and 5.6 ends in June 2023.
</Callout>

* We recommend using a [supported release](http://php.net/supported-versions.php) of PHP.
* Release [9.19](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes/php-agent-9190309) was the last release to support ZTS builds.

<Callout variant="important">
**For installations using an unsupported PHP version or platform (examples: 32 bit OSes, FreeBSD, ZTS), it's highly recommended that you disable the auto-update mechanisms for the PHP agent packages.** This can be done by adding the PHP agent packages to an exclusion list for package upgrades. Or you could version pin the PHP agent package to an agent version that supports the old, unsupported feature(s). Failure to prevent upgrades may result in a newer agent release being installed and removal of support for the required, unsupported features. This would disrupt APM data collection.
The PHP agent packages which are affected are:
   - newrelic-php5
   - newrelic-php5-common
   - newrelic-daemon
</Callout>

## Permissions [#permissions]

* Installation: Root access [is required](/docs/agents/php-agent/troubleshooting/determing-permissions-requirements) for most installations.
* Running: Root access [is not required](/docs/agents/php-agent/troubleshooting/determing-permissions-requirements).

## License key [#license_key]

For any installation, you will need your New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" />. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you [sign up](https://newrelic.com/signup) for your account. For more information, see the PHP [install script](/docs/php/the-newrelic-install-script) and [license key settings](/docs/php/php-agent-phpini-settings#inivar-license) in the PHP INI file.

## Processor type [#processor]

* Intel (and compatible) platforms
* ARM64

## Operating systems [#operating-systems]

The New Relic PHP Agent is supported on Ubuntu, Debian, Amazon Linux, Alpine, RHEL and CentOS Operating Systems (OS).
When vendors announce end of life (e.g., Standard Support for Ubuntu, EOL LTS for Debian,
Maintenance Support for RHEL and Maintenance Update for CentOS), New Relic will continue to support those latest versions for one year. After the year has passed, New Relic will end support for those versions. If the version of PHP youâ€™re using is no longer officially available for an OS, then support could end sooner than one year. It is highly recommended
to use the latest version of the OS that is officially supported by the vendor.
The latest versions of our agent may work on OS versions that are past End of Life, 
however it is no longer tested or officially supported by the New Relic PHP Agent.

The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app.

For more information, see [PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic](/docs/php/framework-developers-integrated-support-for-new-relic). If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the [Support Forum](https://discuss.newrelic.com/tags/phpagent) and create a `Feature Idea`!

## Other APM software [#other-monitoring-software]

If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see [Errors when using other monitoring software](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/troubleshooting/errors-while-using-new-relic-apm-alongside-other-apm-software).

## Instance details

New Relic collects [instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers](/docs/apm/applications-menu/features/analyze-database-instance-level-performance-issues). The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM is available for the following:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>

</table>

To disable collection of host information, use either of these options:

* Set `newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled` to `false` in the `newrelic.ini`.
* Omit the database name with `newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false`.

To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com).

## Codesteam/Code-level metrics

The PHP agent supports code-level metrics for PHP releases 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 8.0, 8.1 and 8.2.

## Logs In Context [#logging]

The PHP agent supports APM [logs in context](/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-php/) for the following libraries:

* Monolog 2 and 3

## Message queuing [#queuing]

* HTTP
* Laravel Queuing

## Security requirements [#security]

As a standard [security measure for data collection](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/security/data-security), your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported.

## Connect the agent to other New Relic features [#digital-intelligence-platform]

The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Product
      </th>

      <th>

    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        [Browser monitoring](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-browser)
      </td>

      <td>
        The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you [enable auto-instrumentation](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation/install-new-relic-browser-agent#select-apm-app). After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the [APM **Summary** page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page) and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see [Browser monitoring and the PHP agent](/docs/agents/php-agent/features/page-load-timing-php).

      <td>
        [Codestream/Code-level metrics](/docs/codestream/how-use-codestream/performance-monitoring/)
      </td>

      <td>
        New Relic CodeStream allows developers to see how the code they're responsible for is performing in production
        by bringing observability into the IDE and making it part of their daily routine.
        The PHP agent reports code-level metrics (starting with release 10.4.0) on your application which enables
        detailed insight into how your code is performing at the method level.

      <td>
        [Infrastructure monitoring](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-infrastructure)
      </td>

      <td>
        When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another. You can then view a list of hosts in the APM UI, and filter your Infrastructure hosts by APM app in the Infrastructure UI. For more information, see [APM data in infrastructure monitoring](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/data-instrumentation/new-relic-apm-data-infrastructure).

        The PHP agent sends [default events and attributes](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-events-attributes/apm-default-event-attributes) for NRQL queries. You can also [record custom events](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/insert-custom-events-new-relic-apm-agents) for advanced analysis.
