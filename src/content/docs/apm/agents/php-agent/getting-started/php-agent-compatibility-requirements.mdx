---

Before you [install](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/installation) New Relic for PHP, make sure your system meets the applicable requirements.

If you don't have one already, [create a New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup). It's free, forever.

## PHP releases [#php-release]

New Relic supports PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 8.0, and 8.1.

<Callout variant="important">
  Compatibility note: When PHP 8.0 or 8.1 detects an observability extension, like the New Relic agent, PHP disables Just-In-Time compilation.

  Support for PHP 8.1 does not include Fibers.
</Callout>

* We recommend using a [supported release](http://php.net/supported-versions.php) of PHP, especially 7.4, 8.0, and 8.1.
* PHP 5.1 support was deprecated in release 4.0 of the agent, and removed in release 4.5.
* PHP 5.2 support was deprecated in release 6.8 of the agent, and removed in release 7.0.
* PHP 5.3 and PHP 5.4 support was deprecated in release [9.15](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes/php-agent-9150293) of the agent, and removed in release [9.17](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes/php-agent-9170300/).
* 32-bit support for PHP versions 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4 was deprecated in release [9.19](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes/php-agent-9190309).
* Release [9.19](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes/php-agent-9190309) is the last release to support ZTS builds. In the future, ZTS builds may not be provided and support may be completely pulled from the codebase.

## Permissions [#permissions]

* Installation: Root access [is required](/docs/agents/php-agent/troubleshooting/determing-permissions-requirements) for most installations.
* Running: Root access [is not required](/docs/agents/php-agent/troubleshooting/determing-permissions-requirements).

## License key [#license_key]

For any installation, you will need your New Relic [license key](/docs/subscriptions/license-key). This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you [sign up](https://newrelic.com/signup) for your account. For more information, see the PHP [install script](/docs/php/the-newrelic-install-script) and [license key settings](/docs/php/php-agent-phpini-settings#inivar-license) in the PHP INI file.

## Processor type [#processor]

* Intel (and compatible) platforms
* ARM64

## Operating systems [#operating-systems]

<Callout variant="important">
  The Windows operating system is not supported.

The PHP agent's list of frameworks continues to grow. Even if the framework you are using is not listed here, the PHP agent may be able to provide you with useful information about your app.

For more information, see [PHP frameworks: Integrating support for New Relic](/docs/php/framework-developers-integrated-support-for-new-relic). If you want to suggest support for other popular PHP frameworks, visit us at the [Explorers Hub](https://discuss.newrelic.com/tags/phpagent) and create a `Feature Idea`!

## Other APM software [#other-monitoring-software]

If your application uses other application performance monitoring (APM) software besides our agent, we cannot guarantee that our agent will work correctly and we cannot offer technical support. For more information, see [Errors when using other monitoring software](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/troubleshooting/errors-while-using-new-relic-apm-alongside-other-apm-software).

## Instance details

New Relic collects [instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers](/docs/apm/applications-menu/features/analyze-database-instance-level-performance-issues). The ability to view specific instances and the types of database information in APM depends on your New Relic agent version.

New Relic's PHP agent [version 6.8 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes/php-agent-680177) supports instance details for the following:

<table>

To disable collection of host information, use either of these options:

* Set `newrelic.datastore_tracer.instance_reporting.enabled` to `false` in the `newrelic.ini`.
* Omit the database name with `newrelic.datastore_tracer.database_name_reporting.enabled = false`.

To request instance-level information from datastores currently not listed for your New Relic agent, get support at [support.newrelic.com](https://support.newrelic.com).

## Message queuing [#queuing]

* HTTP
* Laravel Queuing, available as an experimental feature in the [PHP Agent 6.6.0.169 release](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes/php-agent-660169), enabled by default since [PHP Agent 8.0.0.204](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes/php-agent-800204).

## Security requirements [#security]

As a standard [security measure for data collection](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/security/data-security), your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported.

## Connect the agent to other New Relic features [#digital-intelligence-platform]

The PHP agent integrates with other New Relic features to give you end-to-end visibility:

        The PHP agent automatically injects the browser agent's JS code when you [enable auto-instrumentation](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation/install-new-relic-browser-agent#select-apm-app). After enabling browser injection, you can view data in the [APM **Summary** page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page) and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see [Browser monitoring and the PHP agent](/docs/agents/php-agent/features/page-load-timing-php).

        When you install the infrastructure and APM agents on the same host, they automatically detect one another.
