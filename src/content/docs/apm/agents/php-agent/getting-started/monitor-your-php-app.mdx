Want to start monitoring your PHP application with New Relic right away? Use this guide to find the best path to start sending your application data to New Relic.

Want to learn more before you get started? [Introduction to APM](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-apm) and [Introduction to New Relic for PHP](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-php) are a good place to start.

## What do you want to monitor? [#what]

We have a few paths to install the PHP agent, depending on what you're monitoring.

You have some options for instrumenting your Docker app with the PHP agent.  

   * Install via our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?state=38549f24-54f0-9e80-e910-0c42a9b493b1) if you want your daemon and PHP agent in different containers. If you still need to create your daemon, follow the additional steps in [Docker and other container environments](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/advanced-installation/docker-other-container-environments-install-php-agent#daemon-container) 
   * To set up the agent and daemon in the same container, follow [these steps](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/advanced-installation/docker-other-container-environments-install-php-agent#install-same-container). This involves downloading the [tar archive](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/installation/php-agent-installation-tar-file/) for the PHP agent.

* Our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?state=38549f24-54f0-9e80-e910-0c42a9b493b1) uses `yum` to install the agent, just like our manual installation. The guided install is a great option if you want more visibility and certainty about where you are in the install process. 
* Our [manual install](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/installation/php-agent-installation-aws-linux-redhat-centos#manager-tarball) walks you through the same process, but lets you manage every step from your command line.

* Our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?state=38549f24-54f0-9e80-e910-0c42a9b493b1) uses `apt` to install the agent, just like our manual installation. The guided install is a great option if you want more visibility and certainty about where you are in the install process. 
* Our [manual install](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/installation/php-agent-installation-ubuntu-debian) walks you through the same process, but lets you manage every step from your command line.

    id="tar"
    title="App deployed with other Unix flavors (using tar archive)"

If you're on a different flavor of Unix, install the agent using our [PHP tar archive](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/installation/php-agent-installation-tar-file).
</Collapser>
<Collapser
    id="lambda"
    title="App deployed with AWS Lambda"

If your app is deployed with AWS Lambda, follow our [self-guided steps](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?state=3daeff79-c8e3-4375-f0e0-57d417ec07ab) to instrument your app with the PHP agent.

<Collapser
    id="hosting-providers"
    title="App hosted on AWS, Heroku, Magento, or other hosting providers"

Through partnerships with New Relic, you can run the PHP agent if your web app is hosted on a third party provider. 

* For AWS hosted apps, install the [Amazon CloudWatch Metric Streams integration](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/connect/aws-metric-stream-setup). To learn about New Relic and AWS integrations, read [Intro to AWS integrations](/docs/infrastructure/amazon-integrations/get-started/introduction-aws-integrations/).
* For a Heroku-hosted PHP app, install the [New Relic add-on](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/advanced-installation/php-agent-heroku/#installing)
* If you're a merchant on Magento, [follow these steps](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/partner-based-installation/log-install-new-relic-partners/#magento) to deploy the PHP agent to your Magento installation.
