Our Magento integration monitors the performance of your Magento ecommerce application, helping you diagnose issues in your app's performance and respond by optimizing your code. Our Magento integration relies on our agents to collect and report your app data, and
you'll have access to a pre-built dashboard with important app metrics, like errors, application crashes, app launches, app installations, HTTP errors, and network failures.

        ## (Optional) Install the infrastructure agent

        Our infrastructure agent monitors your host and reports metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, storage usage, disk usage, and network traffic. 
        
        To install the agent, follow the instructions in our guided install by going to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**, search for and select  **Website Performance Monitoring**
        
        If you need to install the agent in a different way, see [Install the infrastructure monitoring agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent/).

        </Step>

    <Step>
        ## Install the PHP agent

        Our PHP agent reports application and browser-related metrics such as AJAX performance, error rate, duration, core web vitals, and throughput.
        
        To install the agent, follow the instructions in our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/nr1-core.settings?pane=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJ0dWNzb24ucGxnLWluc3RydW1lbnQtZXZlcnl0aGluZyJ9&cards[0]=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJzZXR1cC1uZXJkbGV0cy5zZXR1cC1waHAtaW50ZWdyYXRpb24iLCJhY2NvdW50SWQiOjI2NDA0MDl9&platform[accountId]=1).
        
        If you need to install the agent in a different way, see [PHP agent installation overview](/docs/apm/agents/php-agent/installation/php-agent-installation-overview/).

            * Configuration file name: mysql-database-config.yml

        2. Add this `nri-flex` code snippet to the configuration file:

            ```
            # NOTE: 'database' is an experimental API at this time
            # ref: https://github.com/newrelic/nri-flex/blob/master/docs/experimental/db.md

        3. Restart the infrastructure agent

        [Restart the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/manage-your-agent/start-stop-restart-infrastructure-agent/) to start sending all the query results to [one.newrelic.com](one.newrelic.com). 

        Query Example
        Here's an example of a query to view total registered customers on your magento platform:
        ```
        SELECT LATEST(`Registered Accounts`) AS ‘Registered Accounts’ FROM MYSQLCustomerEntityRegisteredUsers
        ```

    </Step>
