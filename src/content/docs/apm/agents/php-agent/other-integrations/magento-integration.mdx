Our Magento integration monitors the performance of your Magento ecommerce application, helping you diagnose issues in your app's performance and respond by optimizing your code. Our Magento integration relies on these New Relic agents and tool:

* PHP agent
* MySQL agent
* Apache agent
* Elasticsearch agent
* (Optional) Infrastructure agent
* NRI-flex (Our all-in-one tool that allows you to collect metric data from a wide variety of services.)

Once you've installed and configured our agents and Flex tool, you'll have access to a pre-built dashboard with your most important Magento app metrics, like errors, application crashes, app launches, app installations, HTTP errors, and network failures.
