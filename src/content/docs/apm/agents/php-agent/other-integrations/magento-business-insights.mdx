            * Path to the configuration file: `/etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d/`
            * Configuration file name: `mysql-database-config.yml`

        2. Add this code snippet to the configuration file:

            ```
            # NOTE: 'database' is an experimental API at this time
            # ref: https://github.com/newrelic/nri-flex/blob/master/docs/experimental/db.md

    ## Install the Magento business insights dashboard [#install-dashboard]

        1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Dashboards**.
        2. In the search bar, type "Magento business insights". The dashboard should appear. 
        3. Click on it to install.

Your Magento dashboard is considered a custom dashboard and can be found in the **Dashboards** UI. For information on using and editing dashboards, see [our dashboard docs](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards).

        </Step>
</Steps>

## Query your Magento data [#query-data]

Interested in querying your Magento app data? Here's an example NRQL query checking the total registered customers on your Magento platform:

```sql
SELECT LATEST(`Registered Accounts`) AS ‘Registered Accounts’ FROM MYSQLCustomerEntityRegisteredUsers
```
