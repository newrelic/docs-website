## Problem

The **newrelic** module appears in your `phpinfo()` page but no data is appearing in your UI and your license key does not appear there.

## Solution

The **`newrelic.ini`** file may not have been read from the configuration file because it may not appear in a directory where PHP expects it to be. To determine where your `newrelic.ini` should appear:

1. In your [`phpinfo()` page](/docs/php/php-kb-103), look at the first section of the page.
2. Check to see if `newrelic.ini` is listed in the section labeled **Additional .ini files parsed**
3. Check to see your `newrelic.ini` file exists in the directory identified in the section labelled **Scan this dir for addition .ini files** or **Additional .ini files parsed** and verify that permissions are suitable for your web server to read it.

If `newrelic.ini` is not the name of your configuration file, check that the file to which you have added your license key and other configuration parameters is listed as having been read. Verify that the permissions on the file provide access for your webserver.
