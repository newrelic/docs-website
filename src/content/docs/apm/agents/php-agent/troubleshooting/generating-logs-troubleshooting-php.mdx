## Problem

You encounter problems with your New Relic for PHP installation but are not sure what is the cause.

## Solution

Monitoring your New Relic logs may help diagnose the problem. The New Relic PHP agent and daemon have their own logs. To monitor the logs:

1. Check both logs for content:
   * **[Default agent log location](/docs/php/php-agent-phpini-settings#inivar-logfile)**: `/var/log/newrelic/php_agent.log`
   * **[Default daemon log location](/docs/php/php-agent-phpini-settings#inivar-daemon-logfile)**: `/var/log/newrelic/newrelic-daemon.log`
2. Set the log level for each to `verbosedebug` for more information:
   * [Setting the agent **loglevel**](/docs/php/php-agent-phpini-settings#inivar-loglevel)
   * [Setting the daemon **loglevel**](/docs/php/php-agent-phpini-settings#inivar-daemon-loglevel)
3. Restart your app.
4. Collect 5 to 10 minutes of log time with your log level set to `verbosedebug`.
5. Examine your logs and use the information to diagnose the problem.
6. When you are finished troubleshooting, reset the logs' levels. Do not keep them at `verbosedebug`.

<Callout variant="caution">
  Watch the size of your log files. Depending on your application, they can grow very quickly.
