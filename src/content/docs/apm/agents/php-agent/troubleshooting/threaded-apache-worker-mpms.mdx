## Problem

The New Relic PHP agent does not support any Apache multi-processing model (MPM) that involves threading.

## Solution

The PHP language development team [discourages the use of a threaded MPM with Apache](http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.unix.apache2.php "Link opens in a new window"), and we have chosen not to implement support for threaded MPMs in the PHP agent for similar stability reasons. This includes the <DoNotTranslate>**worker**</DoNotTranslate> and <DoNotTranslate>**event**</DoNotTranslate> MPMs.

If the default, non-threaded <DoNotTranslate>**prefork**</DoNotTranslate> MPM is unsuitable for your needs for performance reasons, we suggest using <DoNotTranslate>**mod_fcgid**</DoNotTranslate> and <DoNotTranslate>**php-fpm**</DoNotTranslate> to use PHP via FastCGI instead.
