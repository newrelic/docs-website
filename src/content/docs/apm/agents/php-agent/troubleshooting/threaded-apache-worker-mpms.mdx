## Problem

The New Relic PHP agent does not support any Apache multi-processing model (MPM) that involves threading.

## Solution

The PHP language development team [discourages the use of a threaded MPM with Apache](http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.unix.apache2.php "Link opens in a new window"), and we have chosen not to implement support for threaded MPMs in the PHP agent for similar stability reasons. This includes the <DNT>**worker**</DNT> and <DNT>**event**</DNT> MPMs.

If the default, non-threaded <DNT>**prefork**</DNT> MPM is unsuitable for your needs for performance reasons, we suggest using <DNT>**mod_fcgid**</DNT> and <DNT>**php-fpm**</DNT> to use PHP via FastCGI instead.
