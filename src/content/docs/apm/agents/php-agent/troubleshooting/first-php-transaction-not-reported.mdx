## Problem

You installed the New Relic PHP agent and generated some traffic, but the agent does not send the first transaction.

## Solution

This is expected behavior. When the [PHP daemon](/docs/agents/php-agent/getting-started/new-relic-daemon-processes) is in its initial state, <DNT>**two**</DNT> transactions must occur before it will start reporting:

* With the first transaction, the PHP daemon adds your newly-reporting application to its own application information table.
* Once the application is added, the PHP daemon reports the second transaction to New Relic.

Recommendation: Run a trivial php process, such as `phpinfo()`, before running the processes you want reported.

## Cause

This is expected behavior by the PHP daemon, which initially requires two transactions to be reported.
