## Problem

You attempt to install the PHP agent on OS X 10.11 - El Capitan, and it fails.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser title="Failure with the install script">
    You used the script `newrelic-install` and encountered something similar to this:

    ```
    Install daemon ([y]es, [n]o or x to e[x]it): y

    FATAL: failed to copy new daemon into place
    FATAL: New Relic agent installation failed.

    Please contact http://support.newrelic.com
    and report the above error. We have also created a tar file with
    log files and other system info that can help solve the problem.
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser title="Failure with the manual install process">
    You used the [manual install process](/docs/agents/php-agent/advanced-installation/php-agent-installation-non-standard-php-advanced#manual) with the install utility `nrmaninstall.php`, or you followed the manual instructions, and then you encountered something similar to this:

    ```
    $ sudo cp ./agent/x86_64/newrelic-20121212.so /usr/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20121212/
    cp: /usr/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20121212/newrelic-20121212.so: Operation not permitted

    $ sudo cp ./daemon/newrelic-daemon.x86_64 /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon
    cp: /usr/bin/newrelic-daemon: Operation not permitted
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Solution

If necessary, you can install the PHP agent by disabling Apple's System Integrity Protection (SIP). This is true for the `newrelic-install` script and for manual installations.

<Callout variant="caution">
  This is not an endorsement for disabling SIP in general. Be sure to verify that this does not violate the security policies of your organization.
</Callout>

Follow this general procedure:

1. Boot into recovery mode.
2. Disable SIP and reboot.
3. Install the New Relic PHP agent.
4. Boot into recovery mode.
5. Re-enable SIP and reboot.

There are many articles available on the web that describe SIP and the steps for disabling, re-enabling, and checking the status.

## Cause

PHP agent installation requires the daemon program to be installed in `/usr/bin` and the extension module in `/usr/lib`. However, those directories have `R-X` permissions, which means the daemon cannot be installed by normal means.

Apple's System Integrity Protection, SIP, prevents the modification of permissions on these directories even when logged in as root, admin, or via a sudo privileged account. This also applies in situations where the PHP `bin` is self-contained (for example, MAMP).
