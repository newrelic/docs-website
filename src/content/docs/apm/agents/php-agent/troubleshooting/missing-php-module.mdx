## Problem

**newrelic** module section does not appear in `phpinfo()`.

## Solution

A missing `newrelic` module description section in the `phpinfo()` page indicates that the **`newrelic.so`** file may not have been installed in the extensions directory. To determine whether the New Relic PHP module exists:

1. In your [`phpinfo()` page](/docs/php/php-kb-103), look for the **PHP Core** section.
2. To identify the directory from where your PHP extensions are loaded, find the local value of the `extension_dir` setting.
3. Verify that `newrelic.so` is present in the directory specified by `extension_dir`.

If `newrelic.so` file is not present in your extensions directory, either:

* Follow New Relic's [non-standard PHP installation procedures](/docs/php/php-agent-installation-non-standard-php).

  OR
* Manually link in the correct version from `/usr/lib/newrelic-php5/agent/x32` for 32 bit, or `/usr/lib/newrelic-php5/agent/x64` for 64-bit. Or, if you installed from a tar file, copy or link from the **agent** directory where you extracted the tar file.
