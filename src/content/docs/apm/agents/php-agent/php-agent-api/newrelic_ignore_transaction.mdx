## Syntax

```
newrelic_ignore_transaction()
```

Do not instrument the current transaction.

## Requirements

Compatible with all agent versions.

## Description

Do not generate data for this transaction. This is useful when you have transactions that are particularly slow for known reasons and you do not want them frequently generating transaction traces or skewing your site averages.

## Parameters

This call does not accept any parameters.

## Examples

```
function example() {
    if (extension_loaded('newrelic')) { // Ensure PHP agent is available
        newrelic_ignore_transaction();
    }
    <var>...</var>
}
```
