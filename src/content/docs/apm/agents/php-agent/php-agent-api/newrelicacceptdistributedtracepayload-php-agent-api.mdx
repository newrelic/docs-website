## Syntax

```php
newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload (string $payload)
```

Accepts a distributed trace payload.

## Requirements

Requires PHP agent [version 8.4 or higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes).

## Description

[Distributed tracing](/docs/agents/php-agent/features/distributed-tracing-php) allows you to see the path that a request takes as it travels through a distributed system.

<Callout variant="important">
  With PHP agent [version 9.10 or](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/php-release-notes) higher, the following JSON functions are now considered deprecated and will be removed in a future release:

  ```php
  newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload()
  newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload($payload)
  newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_payload_httpsafe($payload)
  ```

  Instead, use the API that is compatible with W3C Trace Context support, added in agent version 9.8. With this, the API for manually instrumenting applications has changed from the JSON payload related functions to the following header array forms:

  ```php
  newrelic_insert_distributed_trace_headers($outbound_headers)
  newrelic_accept_distributed_trace_headers($inbound_headers)
  ```
</Callout>

## Parameters

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width="25%">
        Parameter
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `$payload`

        _string_
      </td>

      <td>
        Required: a JSON formatted string created by using `newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload`.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
