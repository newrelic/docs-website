Our [PHP agent](/docs/agents/php-agent/getting-started/new-relic-php#configuration) auto-instruments your code so you can start monitoring applications. These are the standard procedures to install our PHP agent on Ubuntu or Debian on x86_64 architecture. (This is not the same as the Ubuntu and Debian procedures for the [infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation/install-infrastructure-linux#apt-based).) For installation on aarch64 architecture, please use [tar file](/docs/php/php-agent-installation-tar-files) method. For other situations, see the [PHP agent procedures for non-standard PHP installations](/docs/php/php-agent-installation-non-standard-php).

## PHP versions [#php7]

The package name for New Relic's PHP agent is `newrelic-php5`. Although the package name references PHP 5, this package works for all [supported PHP versions](/docs/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-compatibility-requirements#php-release).

## Recommended: Use `apt` [#use-apt]

This is the recommended method for New Relic installation and maintenance.

<Callout variant="important">
  Run the commands in this procedure as root.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Configure the New Relic apt repository [#configure-repo]

    New Relic's apt repository configuration is only required once per system. To do so, complete these two tasks:

    #### 1. Trust the New Relic GPG key

       For all Ubuntu releases and Debian releases _before_ Debian Trixie use:

       ```bash
       wget -O- https://download.newrelic.com/NEWRELIC_APT_2DAD550E.public | sudo gpg --import --batch --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/download.newrelic.com-newrelic.gpg
       ```

       For Debian Trixie and later use:

       ```bash
       wget -O- https://download.newrelic.com/NEWRELIC_APT_2DAD550E.public | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/download.newrelic.com-newrelic.gpg
       ```

       This command installs New Relic's GPG key used by `apt` to verify signatures of packages in `http://apt.newrelic.com/debian/` apt repository added in next step.

    #### 2. Add `http://apt.newrelic.com/debian/` apt repository to `sources.list`

       ```bash
       echo 'deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/download.newrelic.com-newrelic.gpg] http://apt.newrelic.com/debian/ newrelic non-free' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/newrelic.list
       ```

       This command adds `deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/download.newrelic.com-newrelic.gpg] http://apt.newrelic.com/debian/ newrelic non-free` to `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/newrelic.list`. It creates the file if it does not exist.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Update the local package list [#update-package-list]

    Execute the following command as root:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```
    <Callout variant="important">
      If you see this error:
      ```
      Err:8 http://apt.newrelic.com/debian newrelic Release.gpg
      The following signatures were invalid: B60A3EC9BC013B9C23790EC8B31B29E5548C16BF (untrusted public key algorithm: dsa1024)
      ```
      or this error:
      ```
      Err:8 https://apt.newrelic.com/debian newrelic Release.gpg
      The following signatures were invalid: B60A3EC9BC013B9C23790EC8B31B29E5548C16BF (untrusted public key algorithm: dsa1024) The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 32FA4C172DAD550E
      ```
      please make sure you have the correct New Relic GPG key installed. See the [Trust the New Relic GPG key](#1-trust-the-new-relic-gpg-key) section for instructions how to install the New Relic GPG key.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Install the PHP agent [#install-php-agent]

    Execute the following command to install directly from the New Relic repositories:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install newrelic-php5
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Non-standard installations: Complete installation manually [#manual-install]

    If you are not using the default Ubuntu or Debian PHP packages, the `newrelic-php5` package may be unable to configure PHP automatically. You may see this error:

    ```
    Please run newrelic-install as root to complete installation.
    ```

    If so, run the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo newrelic-install install
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Configure your application name and New Relic license key [#license-key]

    The installation process prompts for your application name and license key. Your <InlinePopover type="licenseKey"/> appears in the account information section of <DNT>**Account settings**</DNT>. For headless installations, you can also [preconfigure your license key and application name by using `debconf`](#preseeding).
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Restart your web server or FastCGI Process Manager (FPM) [#fpm]

    Generate traffic for your app, and wait a few minutes for your application to send data to New Relic. Then, [check your app's performance in the New Relic UI](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Optional: Unattended installation [#unattended]

To run an unattended installation, you can use non-interactive mode. Include the `-y` flag to automatically respond `yes` to any prompt during package installation. For example:

```bash
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get -y install newrelic-php5
```

## Manual: Use `dpkg` [#use-dpkg]

<Callout variant="important">
  If you use `dpkg`, you must manually install updates. This is why New Relic recommends the [`apt` method](#use-apt) for installation and maintenance. Run the commands in this procedure as root.
</Callout>

To install the PHP agent manually using `dpkg`:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Copy the URL for the package download [#copy-package]

    Copy the full URL for the latest `newrelic-daemon`, `newrelic-php5-common`, and `newrelic-php5` packages from [New Relic's repository](https://apt.newrelic.com/debian/dists/newrelic/non-free/binary-amd64/)
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Download the package [#download-package]

    Run the following `wget` command, replacing `https://LINK_TO_PACKAGE` with the full URL of the package:

    ```bash
    wget -L https://LINK_TO_PACKAGE
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Install the PHP agent [#manual-install]

    Run the install command as root, replacing `X.X.X.X` with the current version:

    ```bash
    dpkg -i newrelic-php5-common_X.X.X.X_all.deb newrelic-daemon_X.X.X.X_amd64.deb newrelic-php5_X.X.X.X_amd64.deb
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Configure your application name and New Relic license key [#configure-key]

    The installation process prompts for your application name and license key. Your <InlinePopover type="licenseKey"/> appears in the account information section of <DNT>**Account settings**</DNT>. For headless installations, you can also [preconfigure your license key and application name by using `debconf`](#preseeding).
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Restart your web server or FastCGI Process Manager (FPM) [#restart-server]

    Generate traffic for your app, and wait a few minutes for your application to send data to New Relic. Then, [check your app's performance in the New Relic UI](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Headless: Preconfigure license key and app name [#preseeding]

For headless installations, you need to take steps to preconfigure your <InlinePopover type="licenseKey"/> and [application name](/docs/site/naming-your-application). You must use the default php5 packages provided by your distribution. To preconfigure the license key and application name, set values in your `debconf` database by using [`debconf-set-selections`](https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/debconf/debconf-set-selections.1.en.html).

<Callout variant="important">
  These settings will be ignored if you are not using a packaged PHP. You will be prompted to run `newrelic-install`.
</Callout>

These keys are located in the `newrelic-php5` package:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Name
      </th>

      <th width="100px">
        Type
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        ```
        newrelic-php5/application-name
        ```

        The name of your app. This string sets [`newrelic.appname`](/docs/php/php-agent-phpini-settings#inivar-appname) in your `newrelic.ini`.
      </td>

      <td>
        string
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        ```
        newrelic-php5/license-key
        ```

        Your <InlinePopover type="licenseKey"/>. This string sets [`newrelic.license`](/docs/php/php-agent-phpini-settings#inivar-license) in your `newrelic.ini`.
      </td>

      <td>
        string
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

For example, you can run these commands to preconfigure your app name and license key:

```bash
echo newrelic-php5 newrelic-php5/application-name string "My App Name" | debconf-set-selections
echo newrelic-php5 newrelic-php5/license-key string "YOUR_LICENSE_KEY" | debconf-set-selections
```
