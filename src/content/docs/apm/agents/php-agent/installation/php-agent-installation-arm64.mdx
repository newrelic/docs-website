### Build [#install]

<Callout variant="tip">

2. Once you've created `newrelic.ini` and put it in the correct location, edit the file to add the following:

   * Add a valid <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> to the line `newrelic.license = "INSERT_YOUR_LICENSE_KEY"`.
   * Change the application name that's shown in **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)** on the line `newrelic.appname = "PHP Application"` (optional).
