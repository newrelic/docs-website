Starting in March of 2026, for best practices and security, new releases of New Relic PHP Agent RPM packages will be signed with a new signing key. To continue operation of the PHP Agent uninterrupted, anyone installing via rpm/yum should perform the following command before installing or upgrading their agent.

```rpm --import https://download.newrelic.com/php_agent/NEWRELIC_RPM_BD2E199C.public```

## Verify the key

Once the key has been imported, you can verify that it is trusted by running:

```rpm -qa | grep gpg-pubkey-bd2e199c```

If the key is properly imported and trusted, the output of this command will be ```gpg-pubkey-bd2e199c-6970e650```

## What happens if you do not import the new key before March?

If the new key is not added to your system, installs and upgrades of new releases of the PHP Agent will fail, with an error message such as ```Error: GPG check FAILED```. Any installs pinned to older versions of the agent will continue to function as before (though in such cases adding importing the new key anyway is recommended).
