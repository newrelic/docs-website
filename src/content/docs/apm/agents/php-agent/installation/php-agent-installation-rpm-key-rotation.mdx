Starting in March of 2026, for best practices and security, new releases of New Relic PHP Agent RPM packages will be signed with a new key. To continue operation of the PHP Agent uninterrupted, before installing or upgrading New Relic PHP Agent from RPM packages the following command should be executed to accept and import the new public key.

```rpm --import https://download.newrelic.com/php_agent/NEWRELIC_RPM_BD2E199C.public```

## Verify the key

After you import the key, verify that it is trusted by running the following command:

```rpm -qa | grep gpg-pubkey-bd2e199c```

If the key is imported and trusted, the command returns the following output:

```gpg-pubkey-bd2e199c-6970e650```

## What happens if you do not import the new key before March?

If the new key is not added to your system, installs and upgrades of new releases of the PHP Agent will fail, with an error message such as ```Error: GPG check FAILED```. Any installs pinned to older versions of the agent will continue to function as before (though in such cases adding importing the new key anyway is recommended).
