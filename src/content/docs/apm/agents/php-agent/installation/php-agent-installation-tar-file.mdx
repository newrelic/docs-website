You can install New Relic's PHP agent from compressed tar files on any supported operating system on any supported processor architecture. However, for Redhat or CentOS on x86_64 it is more common to use the [RPM package](/docs/agents/php-agent/installation/php-agent-installation-aws-linux-redhat-centos/). For Ubuntu or Debian on x86_64 it is more common to use the [Debian package](/docs/agents/php-agent/installation/php-agent-installation-ubuntu-debian).

## Download the tar distribution [#download]

Unlike other installation options, tar archives do not require any special repository setup. All you need to do is download the archive and follow these instructions.

Download the appropriate tar distribution file from <DNT>**[download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/](https://download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/)**</DNT>:

* For Linux with GNU libc (most Linux distributions), download `newrelic-php5-X.X.X.X-linux.tar.gz`.
* For Linux with musl libc (Alpine Linux), download `newrelic-php5-X.X.X.X-linux-musl.tar.gz`.

<Callout variant="tip">
  The package name for the PHP agent is `newrelic-php5`. Although the package name references PHP 5, this package works for all [supported PHP versions](/docs/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-compatibility-requirements#php-release).

## Install or update [#install]

With tar file installation, the steps for first time installation and for updating are the same. Replace X.X.X.X with the correct New Relic version. To install or update the agent:

1. Download the appropriate tar file from the [New Relic website](https://download.newrelic.com/php_agent/release/), and save it to a local disk in a convenient location. Don't use the `/tmp` folder.
2. Decompress and extract the archive:

   ```bash
   gzip -dc newrelic-php5-X.X.X.X-OS.tar.gz | tar xf -
   ```
3. Change to the newly created directory:

   ```bash
   cd newrelic-php5-X.X.X.X-OS
   ```
4. Run the installation script:

   ```bash
   ./newrelic-install
   ```
5. Change the default [application name](/docs/site/naming-your-application) to a meaningful name.
6. Restart your web server (Apache, Nginx, PHP-FPM, etc.).
7. Wait a few minutes for your application to send data, then [check your app's performance in the UI](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page).
