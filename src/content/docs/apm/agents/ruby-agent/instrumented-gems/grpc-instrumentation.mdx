metaDescription: The New Relic Ruby agent automatically instruments gRPC clients and servers.
---

## Overview

The [New Relic Ruby agent](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/getting-started/new-relic-ruby) automatically instruments [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) clients and servers that use the [grpc](https://rubygems.org/gems/grpc) gem (version 1.0.0 or higher). All communication types are supported: unary, bidirectional, client-streaming, and server-streaming.

<Callout variant="important">
  gRPC instrumentation requires Ruby agent version 8.10.0 or higher.
</Callout>


## Configuration (All settings are optional)

The instrumentation of gRPC clients and servers can be configured separately. By default, both configuration options are set to `auto`, which is short for `automatic`. The agent's automatic behavior for each is to enable the instrumentation by attempting to leverage Ruby module prepend behavior at first and falling back on Ruby method chaining behavior if known compatibility issues are encountered. 

See additional options and examples in the sections that follow.

### Client and server options

You can alter the behavior of the agent by modifying the New Relic config file or by setting environment variables. Here are the options that apply to both clients and servers:

  - **auto:** The default that is enabled via automatic Ruby method behavior selection
  - **disabled:** Instrumentation disabled
  - **prepend:** Force the use of Ruby method prepending
  - **chain:** Force the use of Ruby method chaining

### gRPC client options

Use the following only for clients:

  - config file parameter: `instrumentation.grpc_client`
  - environment variable: `NEW_RELIC_INSTRUMENTATION_GRPC_CLIENT`

### gRPC server options

Use the following only for servers:

  - config file parameter: `instrumentation.grpc_server`
  - environment variable: `NEW_RELIC_INSTRUMENTATION_GRPC_SERVER`

### Client and server gRPC configuration examples

To disable gRPC server instrumentation via the config file:

```
# newrelic.yml
instrumentation.grpc_server: disabled
```

To disable the gRPC client instrumentation via an environment variable:

```
export NEW_RELIC_INSTRUMENTATION_GRPC_CLIENT=disabled
```

## Verification [#verification]

Once the New Relic Ruby agent starts, it will detect the presence of the `grpc` gem having been loaded and then attempt to apply gRPC instrumentation. When successful at applying this instrumentation for the gRPC client and server components, the agent will write the following lines to its log file (`log/newrelic_agent.log` by default):

```
INFO : Installing New Relic supported gRPC_Client instrumentation using Prepend
INFO : Installing New Relic supported gRPC_Server instrumentation using Prepend
```

## Usage

As long as the instrumentation is working properly (see [Verification](#verification) above to confirm this), all instrumentation performed by the New Relic Ruby agent should be fully automatic and not require any modifications to any of your existing gRPC client and/or server code.

The New Relic Ruby agent's gRPC instrumentation includes distributed tracing headers in spans, which allows gRPC client and server calls to be connected to any other service that supports W3C distributed tracing. gRPC requests can be sent from a Ruby-based client to a server based on another language, and a Ruby-based server can field requests coming from a client based on another language.

<Callout variant="important">
  gRPC client requests will not be reported to New Relic unless they are spawned when an existing New Relic transaction is present. Typically this means that a Rails controller method or background job process is active and responsible for the invocation of the gRPC client request. The request will then roll up under that outer wrapper's transaction in the New Relic web UI.

  gRPC server requests will always generate a new New Relic transaction and will not require nor roll-up to any pre-existing New Relic transaction.
</Callout>


## Viewing Data

See the sections below for information about how to view the collected gRPC data in the New Relic UI.

### Client Instances

On the [Summary page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page), gRPC client requests will appear as web transactions and contribute data to the **Web transactions time**, **Throughput**, and **Error rate** charts.

On the [Distributed tracing page](/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/configuration/distributed-tracing-ruby-agent/), click on a trace group, click on the trace group name again, and then click **Expand all** and then click a specific nested client trace. With a specific client trace selected, select the **Attributes** tab on the right. The `grpc_status`, `grpc_type`, `http.method`, and `http.url` attributes should all appear. In the event of a failed client request (which will have a `grpc_status` value other than `0`), an additional `grpc_message` attribute will appear with the gRPC status message.

If the gRPC client requests are being sent to a gRPC server with New Relic gRPC instrumentation (based on Ruby or another language), then the distributed tracing trace map should display both the client and server applications and report on how many distinct call types were performed between them.

In the event of a gRPC-based Ruby exception, information about the exception will appear on the **Events &gt; Errors** page.

### Server Instances

On the [Summary page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page), gRPC client requests will appear as Web transactions and contribute data to the **Web transactions time**, **Throughput**, and **Error rate** charts.

On the [Distributed tracing page](/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/configuration/distributed-tracing-ruby-agent/), click on a client trace group, and then click on the trace group name again. Then, from the resulting page's list, click on an individual gRPC server trace and click the **Attributes** tab on the right. The `request.grpc_type`, `request.method`, and `request.uri` attributes should all appear.

If the gRPC server handled requests originated from a gRPC client with New Relic gRPC instrumentation (based on Ruby or another language), then the distributed tracing trace map should display both the client and server applications and report on how many distinct call types were performed between them.

In the event of a gRPC-based Ruby exception, information about the exception will appear on the **Events &gt; Errors** page.


## Support and Feedback

When contacting New Relic for support and/or feedback related to the New Relic Ruby agent's gRPC instrumentation, please try to have answers to the following questions:

- What version of the `grpc` gem are you using?
- Do you use New Relic Infinite Tracing?
- How would you describe your application's environment? (Framework, Ruby version, other key technologies used)
- What do you use gRPC for?
- Do you use Ruby for gRPC clients?
- Do you use a different language for gRPC clients?
- Do you use Ruby for gRPC servers?
- Do you use a different language for gRPC servers?
- Where are you calling your gRPC client code? (from a controller, a background job, etc.)
- What strategy/strategies are you using to send your data? (unary, bidirectional, client-streaming, server-streaming)
