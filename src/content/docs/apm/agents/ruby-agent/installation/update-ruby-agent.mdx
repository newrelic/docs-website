To take full advantage of New Relic's latest features, enhancements, and important security patches, we recommend you update your Ruby agent to the latest version. For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the [Ruby agent release notes](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/ruby-release-notes).

## Verify your Ruby agent versions [#determine-versions]

To determine which Ruby agent versions your apps currently use:

1. In New Relic, from the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), select **Account settings > Connected agents**.
2. Optional: Sort by **Oldest agent version**.

## Update the agent [#Updating_the_Agent]

To update the Ruby agent:

* Using Bundler: Run this command:

  ```
  bundle update newrelic_rpm
  ```
* Not using Bundler: Run this command:

  ```
  gem update newrelic_rpm
  ```
