The New Relic <DNT>Ruby</DNT> agent provides a public API with documentation available on GitHub. The GitHub documentation tells you how to set up custom instrumentation of your <DNT>Ruby</DNT> app and collect more in-depth data:

* [Overview](https://rubydoc.info/github/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent)
* [Public API methods](https://rubydoc.info/github/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/NewRelic/Agent)

The following sections explain common goals, solutions, and links to relevant parts of the documentation.

<Callout variant="important">
  When using the <DNT>Ruby</DNT> agent API, ensure that you have the latest <DNT>Ruby</DNT> agent release. Several APIs used in the following examples require Ruby agent [version 4.6.0](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/ruby-release-notes/ruby-agent-3170325) or higher.
</Callout>

## Instrument missing sections of your code with transactions [#creating-transactions]

To instrument your app, New Relic separates each path through your code into its own [transaction](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#transaction). New Relic times (or "instruments") the parent method in these transactions to measure your app's overall performance, and collects [transaction traces](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/introduction-transaction-traces) from long-running transactions for additional detail.

Use these methods when New Relic is not instrumenting a particular part of your code at all:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        If you want to...
      </th>

      <th>
        Do this...
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Time a method New Relic is not instrumenting automatically
      </td>

      <td>
        Create a new transaction. See [Tracing transaction entry points](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/customization/ruby-custom-instrumentation#transaction-tracers).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Time something other than a single method call
      </td>

      <td>
        Use the [Tracer API](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/customization/ruby-custom-instrumentation#advanced-tracing).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Prevent a transaction from reporting to New Relic
      </td>

      <td>
        [Ignore](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/customization/ignoring-specific-transactions) the transaction.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Time specific methods using segments [#segments]

If a transaction is already visible in the New Relic UI, but you don't have enough data about a particular method that was called during that transaction, you can create segments to time those individual methods in greater detail. For example, you might want to time a particularly critical method with complex logic.

Use these methods when you want to instrument a method within an existing transaction:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        If you want to...
      </th>

      <th>
        Do this...
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Time a particular method
      </td>

      <td>
        See [Method tracers](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/customization/ruby-custom-instrumentation#method_tracers).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Time something other than a single method call
      </td>

      <td>
        Use the [Tracer API](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/customization/ruby-custom-instrumentation#advanced-tracing).
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Enhance the metadata of a transaction [#metadata]

Sometimes the code you are targeting is visible in the New Relic UI, but some details of the method aren't useful. For example:

* The default name is causing a [metric grouping issue](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/metric-grouping-issues#video).
* You want to add [custom attributes](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-attributes) to your transactions so you can filter them in the [query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data).

Use these methods when you want to change how New Relic instruments a transaction that's already visible in the New Relic UI:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        If you want to...
      </th>

      <th>
        Do this...
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Change the name of a transaction
      </td>

      <td>
        See [Naming transactions](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/customization/ruby-custom-instrumentation#naming-transactions).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Add metadata (such as your customer's account name or subscription level) to your transactions
      </td>

      <td>
        Use [custom attributes](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-attributes). See [Adding custom attributes](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/attributes/ruby-agent-attributes#add-custom-attributes).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Mark a transaction as a background job
      </td>

      <td>
        See [Monitor custom background jobs](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/background-jobs/monitor-ruby-background-processes#custom_background_jobs).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Mark a transaction as a web transaction
      </td>

      <td>
        Pass a `:category => :controller` option to `set_transaction_name()`. For more information, see [Naming transactions](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/customization/ruby-custom-instrumentation#naming-transactions).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Prevent a transaction from affecting your [Apdex score](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction)
      </td>

      <td>
        See [Ignoring Apdex contributions](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/customization/ignoring-specific-transactions#apdex).
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## See related logs [#logs]

To see logs directly within the context of your application's errors and traces, use these API calls to annotate your logs:

* [`linking_metadata`](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/newrelic_rpm/NewRelic/Agent#linking_metadata-instance_method)
* [`current_trace_id`](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/newrelic_rpm/NewRelic/Agent/Tracer#current_trace_id-class_method)
* [`current_span_id`](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/newrelic_rpm/NewRelic/Agent/Tracer#current_span_id-class_method)

For more information about correlating log data with other telemetry data, see our [logs in context](/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-ruby/) documentation.

## Collect or ignore errors [#errors]

Usually the agent detects errors automatically. However, you can manually mark an error with the agent. You can also mark errors as [ignored or expected](/docs/apm/applications-menu/error-analytics/ignoring-errors-new-relic-apm).

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        If you want to...
      </th>

      <th>
        Do this...
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Report an error the agent does not report automatically
      </td>

      <td>
        See [Sending New Relic handled errors](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/customization/sending-new-relic-handled-errors).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Prevent the agent from reporting an error at all
      </td>

      <td>
        Mark the error as ignored. See [Error Collector](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/configuration/ruby-agent-configuration#error_collector) to use the `error_collector.ignore_errors` config option.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Prevent an error from affecting your Apdex or error rate, but still report it to New Relic
      </td>

      <td>
        Mark the error as expected. See [Sending New Relic handled errors](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/customization/sending-new-relic-handled-errors), and set `:expected` to `true`.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Send custom event and metric data from your app [#custom-data]

APM includes a number of ways to record arbitrary custom data. For an explanation of New Relic data types, see [Data collection](/docs/data-analysis/metrics/analyze-your-metrics/data-collection-metric-timeslice-event-data).

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        If you want to...
      </th>

      <th>
        Do this...
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Send data about an event so you can analyze it in dashboards
      </td>

      <td>
        Create a [custom event](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-events). See [`record_custom_event()`](https://www.rubydoc.info/github/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/NewRelic/Agent#record_custom_event-instance_method).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Tag your events with metadata to filter and facet them in dashboards or error analytics
      </td>

      <td>
        Add [custom attributes](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-attributes). Pass a hash of attributes to [`record_custom_event()`](https://www.rubydoc.info/github/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/NewRelic/Agent#record_custom_event-instance_method).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Report custom performance data
      </td>

      <td>
        Create a [custom metric](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/custom-metrics). See [`record_metric()`](https://www.rubydoc.info/github/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/NewRelic/Agent#record_metric-instance_method).
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Control the browser agent [#browser]

Usually the <InlinePopover type="browser"/> agent is added automatically to your pages or deployed by copy/pasting the JavaScript snippet. For more information about these recommended methods, see [Add apps to browser monitoring](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation-configuration/add-apps-new-relic-browser). However, you can also retrieve the browser agent via APM agent API calls. For more information, see `browser_timing_header()`.

## Instrument calls to datastores [#async]

Use these methods to collect data about your app's connections to other datastores:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        If you want to...
      </th>

      <th>
        Do this...
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Time a call to a datastore not instrumented automatically by New Relic
      </td>

      <td>
        See `wrap()`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Time a datastore call that can't cleanly be wrapped in a Ruby block
      </td>

      <td>
        See `Tracer.start_datastore_segment()`. You <DNT>**must**</DNT> call `finish` on the object returned by this method.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Capture SQL queries along with timing
      </td>

      <td>
        See `notice_sql()`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Capture non-SQL queries along with timing
      </td>

      <td>
        See `notice_statement()`.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Instrument calls to externals [#externals]

Use these methods to collect data for external requests:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        If you want to...
      </th>

      <th>
        Do this...
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Time a call to an external request not instrumented automatically by New Relic
      </td>

      <td>
        Use `Tracer.start_external_segment()`. You <DNT>**must**</DNT> call `finish` on the object returned by this method.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Add cross-application tracing (CAT) headers to an outbound HTTP request
      </td>

      <td>
        Use `add_request_headers()`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Read CAT headers from an inbound HTTP request
      </td>

      <td>
        Use `read_response_headers()`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Generate an obfuscated string to transport CAT information in an outbound request
      </td>

      <td>
        Use `get_request_metadata()`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Process an obfuscated string containing CAT information received from an inbound request
      </td>

      <td>
        Use `process_response_metadata()`.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Instrument calls for distributed tracing [#distributed]

<Callout variant="important">
  The following API examples require Ruby agent version 6.9.0 or higher.
</Callout>

These APIs require [distributed tracing to be enabled](/docs/enable-distributed-tracing).

[Distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing) lets you see the paths requests take as they travel through a distributed system.

For general instructions on how to use the calls below to implement distributed tracing, see [Use distributed tracing APIs](/docs/enable-distributed-tracing#agent-apis).

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        If you want to...
      </th>

      <th>
        Do this...
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Send a payload/header to the called service.
      </td>

      <td>
        See `insert_distributed_trace_headers()`.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Accept a payload/header received from the first service, which will link these services together in a trace
      </td>

      <td>
        See `accept_distributed_trace_headers()`.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
