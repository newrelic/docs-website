The [New Relic Ruby agent](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/getting-started/new-relic-ruby) allows you to send information about application deployments by using the [REST API](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/recording-deployments) or a Capistrano recipe (versions 2.x and 3.x) distributed with the Ruby agent. You can then [view deployments in the New Relic UI](/docs/apm/applications-menu/events/deployments-page). By default, all deployment information is recorded in your production environment. You can also customize the `rails_env` variable for other environments, such as staging.

## Assign an application name [#Installation]

To assign an application name:

1. Download the [latest version](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/ruby-release-notes) of the Ruby agent.
2. Set the `app_name` in your `newrelic.yml` file to a [meaningful name](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/installation-and-configuration/naming-your-application).

This will assign instances in the given environment the label given by `app_name` when browsing your data in the New Relic user interface. The deployment upload script will use that label to associate an app with the deployment.

## Record with the command line [#Manual]

If you installed the Ruby agent as a gem, you can record deployments directly by using the `newrelic` executable:

```
newrelic deployments
```

Depending on your environment, you may need to run:

```
$bundle exec newrelic deployment
```

You can use several optional values with `newrelic`. The `description` is short text.

```
deployments [OPTIONS] [description]
OPTIONS:
   -a, --appname=name           Set the application name.
                                Default is app_name setting in newrelic.yml
   -e, --environment=name       Override the (RAILS|RUBY)_ENV setting
   -u, --user=USER              Specify the user deploying.
   -r, --revision=REV           Specify the revision being deployed
   -c, --changes                Read in a change log from the standard input
   -h                           Print this help
```

When using the `-c` option, you can pipe the change log into the script. If not piping when using the `-c` option, select `control-D` to signify the end of file (EOF).

## Record with Capistrano 3.x [#capistrano3]

The New Relic Ruby agent contains a Capistrano recipe that can record app deployments. After [assigning your app name](#Installation), edit your Capistrano files to communicate with the agent:

1. At the top of your Capfile, add the following line:

   ```
   require 'new_relic/recipes'
   ```
2. In your `deploy.rb` file, include:

   ```
   after "deploy:updated", "newrelic:notice_deployment"
   ```

## Record with Capistrano 2.x [#capistrano2]

You can record Capistrano 2.x deployments with the New Relic agent:

1. Tell Capistrano to load New Relic's recipes:

   <CollapserGroup>
     <Collapser
       id="installed-with-gem"
       title="If agent was installed with New Relic gem"
     >
       Add this at the top of your `deploy.rb` file:

       ```
       require 'new_relic/recipes'
       ```
     </Collapser>

     <Collapser
       id="installed-as-rails"
       title="If agent was installed as Rails plugin"
     >
       In your Capfile, add the following line above `load deploy.rb` (if it is not already there):

       ```
       Dir['vendor/plugins/*/recipes/*.rb'].each { |plugin| load(plugin) }
       ```
     </Collapser>
   </CollapserGroup>
2. Add the following hooks to your `deploy.rb` file:

   ```
   # Notify New Relic of deployments.
   # This goes out even if the deploy fails, sadly.
   after "deploy",            "newrelic:notice_deployment"
   after "deploy:migrations", "newrelic:notice_deployment"
   after "deploy:cold",       "newrelic:notice_deployment"
   ```

The next time you run `cap deploy`, the agent notifies New Relic of the deployment, and all time series charts will show the deployment event.

## Customize your Capistrano configuration [#customizing]

If Capistrano is running the deployment notification recipe on a remote build machine,the build machine **must** have your [New Relic License key](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key). You can either copy a valid `newrelic.yml` file to the build machine (possibly using a Capistrano [Before Hook](https://capistranorb.com/documentation/getting-started/before-after/)) or call `set :newrelic_license_key, 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY'` in your Capistrano configuration.

You can customize some deployment information by using Capistrano variables. If defined, these will override the defaults. These apply to both Capistrano 2 and 3.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={230}>
        Capistrano 2 and 3 variables
      </th>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `newrelic_appname`
      </td>

      <td>
        The app where the deployment will appear. By default this comes from the definition in the `newrelic.yml` file for the given `rails_env`.

        If you set this value from the command line, you can only specify one application name. If you set this value in `newrelic.yml`, only the first application name will be used.

      <td>
        The change log, which is determined by running the svn/git `log` command from the local working directory where the Capistrano command was issued.

    </tr>

    <tr>

      </td>

      <td>
        The New Relic [license key](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key) to use. By default this comes from the definition in the `newrelic.yml` file for the given `rails_env`. This is **not** the same as your [REST API key](/docs/apis/getting-started/intro-apis/access-rest-api-keys).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `newrelic_revision`
      </td>

      <td>

      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `newrelic_user`
      </td>

      <td>
        The user to associate with the deployment.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Override Capistrano settings [#override]

In any version of Capistrano, you can override settings in your `deploy.rb`:

```
set :newrelic_user, "username"
```

To override settings with Capistrano 2.x: From the command line:

```
cap production deploy -Snewrelic_desc="Deploying beta Krakatau release"
```

This example will prompt for content that will appear in the deployment's change log:

```
set(:newrelic_changelog) do
  Capistrano::CLI.ui.ask "Enter a summary of changes: "
end
```

## Deploy to staging [#staging]

By default, the `newrelic_rpm` gem comes with Capistrano tasks to record all deployments in your production environment. If you have a separate staging application, you can change the `rails_env` variable setting so that staging deployments are recorded in the staging app instead of the production app.

To identify deployments to your staging environment, use Capistrano or the command line.

        If you are using Capistrano multistage, add this line to `config/deploy/staging.rb`:

        ```
        set :rails_env, "staging"
        ```
      </td>

        Capistrano 2.x

      <td>
        If you are using Capistrano 2.x, add this information from the command line:

        ```
        cap -s rails_env=staging deployment_task_name
        ```
