The [New Relic Ruby agent](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/getting-started/new-relic-ruby) allows you to send information about application deployments by using the [REST API](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/recording-deployments) or a Capistrano recipe (versions 2.x and 3.x) distributed with the Ruby agent. You can then [view deployments in the New Relic UI](/docs/apm/applications-menu/events/deployments-page). By default, all deployment information is recorded in your production environment. You can also customize the `rails_env` variable for other environments, such as staging.

## Assign an application name [#Installation]

To assign an application name:

1. Download the [latest version](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/ruby-release-notes) of the Ruby agent.
2. Set the `app_name` in your `newrelic.yml` file to a [meaningful name](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/installation-and-configuration/naming-your-application).

This will assign instances in the given environment the label given by `app_name` when browsing your data in the New Relic user interface. The deployment upload script will use that label to associate an app with the deployment.

## Add your user key [#api-key]

Optionally, you can record deployments via the New Relic REST API v2. To do this, provide your [user key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#overview-keys) to the agent configuration using `api_key`. When this configuration is present, the `newrelic deployments` command automatically uses the REST API v2 deployment endpoint.

## Record with the command line [#Manual]

If you installed the Ruby agent as a gem, you can record deployments directly by using the `newrelic` executable:

```bash
newrelic deployments
```

Depending on your environment, you may need to run:

```bash
bundle exec newrelic deployment
```

You can use several optional values with `newrelic`. The `description` is short text.

```
deployments [OPTIONS] [description]
OPTIONS:
   -a, --appname=name           Set the application name.
   -i, --appid=ID               Set the application ID
                                If not provided, will connect to the New Relic collector to get it
                                Default is app_name setting in newrelic.yml
   -e, --environment=name       Override the (RAILS|RUBY)_ENV setting
   -u, --user=USER              Specify the user deploying.
   -r, --revision=REV           Specify the revision being deployed
   -c, --changes                Read in a change log from the standard input
   -h                           Print this help
```

When using the `-c` option, you can pipe the change log into the script. If not piping when using the `-c` option, select `control-D` to signify the end of file (EOF).

## Record with Capistrano 3.x [#capistrano3]

The New Relic Ruby agent contains a Capistrano recipe that can record app deployments. After [assigning your app name](#Installation), edit your Capistrano files to communicate with the agent:

1. At the top of your Capfile, add the following line:

   ```rb
   require 'new_relic/recipes'
   ```
2. In your `deploy.rb` file, include:

   ```rb
   after "deploy:updated", "newrelic:notice_deployment"
   ```

## Record with Capistrano 2.x [#capistrano2]

You can record Capistrano 2.x deployments with the New Relic agent:

1. Tell Capistrano to load New Relic's recipes:

   <CollapserGroup>
     <Collapser
       id="installed-with-gem"
       title="If agent was installed with New Relic gem"
     >
       Add this at the top of your `deploy.rb` file:

       ```rb
       require 'new_relic/recipes'
       ```
     </Collapser>

     <Collapser
       id="installed-as-rails"
       title="If agent was installed as Rails plugin"
     >
       In your Capfile, add the following line above `load deploy.rb` (if it is not already there):

       ```rb
       Dir['vendor/plugins/*/recipes/*.rb'].each { |plugin| load(plugin) }
       ```
     </Collapser>
   </CollapserGroup>
2. Add the following hooks to your `deploy.rb` file:

   ```rb
   # Notify New Relic of deployments.
   # This goes out even if the deploy fails, sadly.
   after "deploy",            "newrelic:notice_deployment"
   after "deploy:migrations", "newrelic:notice_deployment"
   after "deploy:cold",       "newrelic:notice_deployment"
   ```

The next time you run `cap deploy`, the agent notifies New Relic of the deployment, and all time series charts will show the deployment event.

## Customize your Capistrano configuration [#customizing]

If Capistrano is running the deployment notification recipe on a remote build machine,the build machine **must** have your <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" />. You can either copy a valid `newrelic.yml` file to the build machine (possibly using a Capistrano [Before Hook](https://capistranorb.com/documentation/getting-started/before-after/)) or call `set :newrelic_license_key, 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY'` in your Capistrano configuration.

You can customize some deployment information by using Capistrano variables. If defined, these will override the defaults. These apply to both Capistrano 2 and 3.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={230}>
        Capistrano 2 and 3 variables
      </th>

      <th>
        Description
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        `newrelic_appname`
      </td>

      <td>
        The app where the deployment will appear. By default this comes from the definition in the `newrelic.yml` file for the given `rails_env`.

        If you set this value from the command line, you can only specify one application name. If you set this value in `newrelic.yml`, only the first application name will be used.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `newrelic_changelog`
      </td>

      <td>
        The change log, which is determined by running the svn/git `log` command from the local working directory where the Capistrano command was issued.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `newrelic_desc`
      </td>

      <td>
        Descriptive text that appears with the deployment. Default is empty.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `newrelic_license_key`
      </td>

      <td>
        The New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> to use. By default this comes from the definition in the `newrelic.yml` file for the given `rails_env`. This is **not** the same as your [REST API key](/docs/apis/getting-started/intro-apis/access-rest-api-keys).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `newrelic_revision`
      </td>

      <td>
        The revision recorded for the deployment. **Recommendation:** If you are using Subversion, consider including the tag or branch name in addition to the revision.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `newrelic_user`
      </td>

      <td>
        The user to associate with the deployment.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Override Capistrano settings [#override]

In any version of Capistrano, you can override settings in your `deploy.rb`:

```rb
set :newrelic_user, "username"
```

To override settings with Capistrano 2.x: From the command line:

```bash
cap production deploy -Snewrelic_desc="Deploying beta Krakatau release"
```

This example will prompt for content that will appear in the deployment's change log:

```rb
set(:newrelic_changelog) do
  Capistrano::CLI.ui.ask "Enter a summary of changes: "
end
```

## Deploy to staging [#staging]

By default, the `newrelic_rpm` gem comes with Capistrano tasks to record all deployments in your production environment. If you have a separate staging application, you can change the `rails_env` variable setting so that staging deployments are recorded in the staging app instead of the production app.

To identify deployments to your staging environment, use Capistrano or the command line.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Deploy to staging
      </th>

      <th>
        Comments
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Capistrano multistage
      </td>

      <td>
        If you are using Capistrano multistage, add this line to `config/deploy/staging.rb`:

        ```rb
        set :rails_env, "staging"
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Capistrano 2.x
      </td>

      <td>
        If you are using Capistrano 2.x, add this information from the command line:

        ```bash
        cap -s rails_env=staging deployment_task_name
        ```
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
