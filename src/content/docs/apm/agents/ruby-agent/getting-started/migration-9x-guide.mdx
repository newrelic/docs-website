## Summary [#summary]

This guide covers the major changes between the 8.x and 9.x series of the Ruby agent, issues that may be encountered while upgrading, and how to successfully migrate to version 9.x.

The main changes include:

* [Removed all deprecated configuration options](#removed_config)
* [Dropped support for Ruby 2.2 and 2.3](#ruby_2223)
* [Enabled Thread tracing by default](#thread_tracing)
* [Removed deprecated instrumentation for gems](#removed_gem_instrumentation)
* [Updated API method `set_transaction_name`](#set_transaction_name)
* [Removed deprecated API methods](#removed_api_methods)

See the [milestone for 9.0](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/milestone/28?closed=1) for more information.

## Removed Deprecated Configuration [#removed_config]

  The following configuration options have been removed and will no longer work. Please update all configs to use the replacements listed below. Please see our [configuration documentation](/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/configuration/ruby-agent-configuration) for details.

## Removed Support for Ruby 2.2 and 2.3 [#ruby_2223]

  Ruby 2.2 and 2.3 are no longer supported by the Ruby agent. To continue using the latest Ruby Agent version, please update to Ruby 2.4.0 or above.

  Note that New Relic continues to provide support for certain older Ruby versions even after they have fallen out of the officially supported maintenance window provided by the Ruby language development team (Ruby team). For example, as of March 2023 the oldest Ruby version supported by the Ruby team will be version 3.0, whereas with version 9.0 of the New Relic agent, Ruby versions 2.4 and above are still supported. For more information about official Ruby team support of Ruby versions, see [Ruby Maintenance Branches](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/).


## Enabled Thread Tracing by Default [#thread_tracing]

  The configuration option `instrumentation.thread.tracing` is now enabled by default. This configuration allows the agent to properly monitor code occurring inside threads. In Ruby agent 9.0, instrumented code within threads will be recorded and associated with the current transaction when the thread was created.
This may be a breaking change if you are currently using custom thread instrumentation. New transactions inside of threads will no longer be started if one already exists.


## Removed Deprecated Instrumentation [#removed_gem_instrumentation]

  Instrumentation for the following gems had been previously deprecated and has now been removed.

  * Acts As Solr
  * Authlogic
  * DataMapper
  * Rainbows
  * Sunspot
  
  Versions of the following technologies had been previously deprecated and are no longer supported.
  
  * Passenger: 2.2.x - 4.0.x
  * Puma: 2.0.x
  * Grape: 0.2.0
  * Padrino: 0.14.x
  * Rails: 3.2.x
  * Sinatra: 1.4.x, 1.5.x
  * Mongo: 1.8.x - 2.3.x
  * Sequel: 3.37.x, 4.0.x
  * Delayed_Job: 2.0.x - 4.0.x
  * Sidekiq: 4.2.x
  * Excon: below 0.55.0
  * HttpClient: 2.2.0 - 2.8.0
  * HttpRb: 0.9.9 - 2.2.1
  * Typhoeus: 0.5.3 - 1.2.x
  * Bunny: 2.0.x - 2.6.x 
  * ActiveMerchant: 1.25.0 - 1.64.x 
  

## Updated API method `set_transaction_name` [#set_transaction_name]

When the method `NewRelic::Agent.set_transaction_name` is called, it will now always change the name and category of the currently running transaction to what is passed into the method. This is a change from previous agent versions. 
  
Previously, if `set_transaction_name` was called with a new transaction name and a new category that did not match the category already assigned to a transaction, neither the new name nor category would be saved to the transaction. 
  If this method is being called in a situation in which it was previously ignored due to category differences, this will now change the name and category of the transaction. 


## Removed API method [#removed_api_methods]

  The deprecated API method `NewRelic::Agent.disable_transaction_tracing` has been removed. Instead use either `NewRelic::Agent#ignore_transaction` to disable the recording of the current transaction or `NewRelic::Agent.disable_all_tracing` to yield a block without collecting any metrics or traces in any of the subsequent calls.
