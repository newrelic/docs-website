The New Relic Ruby agent is now fully open source and available on GitHub at [newrelic-ruby-agent](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-ruby-agent/tree/main). As of version 6.12 (released July 16, 2020), it's licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. For older agent versions, check the LICENSE file included with the source code. The source code for Ruby agent versions 2.1.0 are available on GitHub using tags.

The head of `main` will have New Relic's latest release. However, we reserve the ability to push an edge to the `main`. The `dev` branch includes unreleased work. If you download a release from GitHub, use the appropriate tag. We usually release preview versions via GitHub before publishing a new version to RubyGems.
