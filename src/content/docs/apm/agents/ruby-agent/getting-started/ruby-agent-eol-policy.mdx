The following are the specific policies and dates for support of our Ruby agent. See our documentation about [general EOL policies](/docs/licenses/end-of-life/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software/) for information about New Relic's overall end-of-life policy.

## New Relic Ruby agent releases and support dates [#ruby-eol]

Any versions not listed in the following table are no longer supported. Please [update your Ruby agent version](/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/installation/update-ruby-agent) to the [latest release](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/ruby-release-notes/).

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        [Ruby agent release](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/ruby-release-notes/)
      </th>

      <th>
        Start date
      </th>

      <th>
        End date
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <EolPage agent="ruby"/>
</table>

## Ruby runtimes [#ruby-runtimes]

The latest version of the New Relic Ruby agent may support a Ruby version outside the [Ruby Maintenance Branches policy](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/) set by the Ruby Core community. Support for older Rubies is often dropped during a major agent version release.
