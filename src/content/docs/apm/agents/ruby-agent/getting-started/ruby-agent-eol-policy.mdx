---

The following are the specific policies and dates for support of our Ruby agent. New Relic Agents follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) to indicate **MAJOR** versions may include breaking changes. **MAJOR** versions may drop support for language runtimes that have reached End-of-Life according to the maintainer. Additionally, **MAJOR** versions may drop support for and remove certain instrumentation. See our documentation about [general EOL policies](/docs/licenses/end-of-life/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software/) for information about New Relic's overall end-of-life policy.

## New Relic Ruby agent releases and support dates [#ruby-eol]

Any versions not listed in the following table are no longer supported. Please [update your Ruby agent version](/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/installation/update-ruby-agent) to the [latest release](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/ruby-release-notes/).

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>

## Ruby runtimes [#ruby-runtimes]

The latest version of the New Relic Ruby agent may support a Ruby version outside the [Ruby Maintenance Branches policy](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/) set by the Ruby Core community. Support for older Rubies is often dropped during a major agent version release.
