Our Ruby agent automatically instruments several common background job frameworks. You can also customize it to trace any background tasks. Data from background jobs appears in the [**Transactions** page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/transactions-page) in APM as **Non-web transactions**.

## Supported frameworks [#supported_frameworks]

The following background job frameworks are supported by default in recent versions of the Ruby agent:

* [Resque instrumentation](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/background-jobs/resque-instrumentation) (Ruby agent 3.4.0)
* [Sidekiq instrumentation](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/background-jobs/sidekiq-instrumentation) (Ruby agent 3.6.0)
* [Delayed::Job instrumentation](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/background-jobs/delayedjob) (Ruby agent 2.10)

</Callout>

If you are using these frameworks, monitoring background jobs typically doesn't require additional configuration.

## Monitor custom background jobs [#custom_background_jobs]

You can instrument custom background jobs to appear in the APM [**Transactions** page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/transactions-page) as **Non-web transactions**. To monitor **Non-web transactions** while using an unsupported framework, you must add custom instrumentation.

As an example, a background job periodically runs a task called `SalesOrganization#find_new_leads`.

1. Add the `ControllerInstrumentation` module.
2. Use the `add_transaction_tracer` directive **below** the method definition
3. Add `:category => :task` to tell the agent this trace is a **Non-web transaction**.

   ```
   require 'newrelic_rpm' 

   class SalesOrganization
     include 
   ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation 
     def find_new_leads 
       <var>...</var> 
     end 
     add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task 
   end
   ```

   You can pass a string to the `:category`, but values will only appear on the APM **Transactions** page if the string begins with `OtherTransaction/`.

## Monitor custom background methods [#custom_methods]

Using the Ruby agent API, you can designate specific methods to trace the **Non-web transactions**. This gathers traces for slow running jobs and associates captured errors to transactions.

To instrument a class method, use the class `singleton`.

As an example, a background job periodically runs a task called `SalesOrganization#find_new_leads`.

1. Add the `ControllerInstrumentation` module **below** the method definition.
2. Use the `add_transaction_tracer` directive
3. Add `:category => :task` to tell the agent this trace is a **Non-web transaction**.

   ```
   require 'newrelic_rpm' 

   class SalesOrganization 
     def self.find_new_leads
       <var>...</var> 
     end 
     class << self 
         include 
   ::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation 
       add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task 
     end 
   end
   ```

   For more information, see [Ruby custom metrics](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/features/ruby-custom-metrics).

## Monitor short-lived processes [#short]

Make sure the process isn't running before the agent connects to the back-end servers. To do so, make the Ruby agent synchronously connect to New Relic, rather than the default asynchronous behavior.

Use [`manual_start`](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/newrelic/rpm/NewRelic%2FAgent%3Amanual_start) and pass in the `:sync_startup => true` option:

```
require 'new_relic/agent' 
NewRelic::Agent.manual_start(:sync_startup => true)
```

Using `require 'new_relic/agent'` will require the agent's code, and it will make sure the agent doesn't run until you manually start it.

If the process is shorter than the agent [harvest cycle](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#harvest-cycle), you need to manually shut down the agent with [`::NewRelic::Agents.shutdown`](https://www.rubydoc.info/github/newrelic/rpm/NewRelic%2FAgent:shutdown) to ensure all queued data is sent.

## Configure newrelic.yml for background processes [#config_file]

Configuring your **newrelic.yml** depends on the context of the background application.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="non_rails"
    title="Non-Rails background application"
  >
    If your background app is non-Rails application already running the Ruby agent, copy your **newrelic.yml** file to the directory where you launch the background job or in the **config** subdirectory. Make sure it includes your [license key](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-setup/your-license-key).

    Background jobs that do not run in a Rails context will examine the `NEW_RELIC_ENV` environment variable to determine which section of the configuration file to read, falling back to the `RUBY_ENV`, `RAILS_ENV`, and `RACK_ENV` environment variables in sequence, and finally defaulting to `development` if none of these environment variables are set.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="existing_rails_app"
    title="Background job environment monitored by New Relic"
  >
    If your background job runs in the context of an existing web application that is already monitored with New Relic, the Ruby agent will automatically pick up your existing **newrelic.yml** file. Background jobs that boot your application's Rails environment will use the `RAILS_ENV` environment variable in order to determine which section of the **newrelic.yml** file to read.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Report to an alternate application name [#reporting_to_an_alternate_application_name]

You can make jobs that run in the context of an existing New Relic web application appear under a [different application name](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/installation-configuration/naming-your-application) in the APM UI.

1. Begin **before** `newrelic_rpm` gets required by your worker code.
2. Set the `NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME` environment variable to the application name to use for your background jobs when starting your background worker processes. This will override the `app_name` setting in your **newrelic.yml**.

   ```
   $ NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME="My Background Jobs" 
   ./bin/my_background_worker.rb
   ```

## Ensure the agent starts [#start_agent]

The Ruby agent will automatically start in most cases as soon as you `require 'newrelic_rpm'`, unless the agent detects a blacklisted executable name, rake task name, or constant. This prevents it from starting during common rake tasks and interactive console sessions.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="non_rails_standalone"
    title="Non-Rails standalone script"
  >
    Standalone scripts running without Rails generally will start the agent as soon as they `require 'newrelic_rpm'`. If you have a script that forks or daemonizes before it begins its main work, you may want to defer this `require` call until after the initial setup finishes.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="existin_rails_app"
    title="Background tasks with daemons gem"
  >
    If you use the [daemons gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/daemons) to start background tasks, the Ruby agent may fail to start and also not emit any logging. This happens because the daemons gem changes the working directory to `/` before executing your background code. The agent then attempts to resolve the paths to its configuration file and log file relative to the current working directory of the host process.

    To allow the agent to start in this situation, set environment variables with the locations of the agent configuration file and log file; for example:

    ```
    ENV['NRCONFIG'] ||= File.dirname(__FILE__) + 
        '/../../config/newrelic.yml' 
        ENV['NEW_RELIC_LOG'] ||= File.dirname(__FILE__) + 
        '/../../log/newrelic_agent.log'
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Monitor scripts [#monitoring_scripts]

The [agent startup instructions](#start_agent) apply when running background jobs in a daemon. If a script executes a single background task and exits, manually shut down the agent with `::NewRelic::Agents.shutdown` when the script finishes. This ensures the New Relic collector receives the data. For example:

```
require 'newrelic_rpm' 

class SalesOrganization 
  include 
::NewRelic::Agent::Instrumentation::ControllerInstrumentation 
  def find_new_leads 
    <var>...</var>
  end 
  add_transaction_tracer :find_new_leads, :category => :task 
end 

SalesOrganization.new.find_new_leads 
::NewRelic::Agent.shutdown
```
