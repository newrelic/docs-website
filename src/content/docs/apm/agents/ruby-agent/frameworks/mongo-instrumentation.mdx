The Ruby agent has built-in instrumentation for MongoDB queries made via the [`mongo`](https://rubygems.org/gems/mongo "Link opens in a new window") gem.

This summarizes the Ruby agent's support for gems by version.

## Third-party and rpm_contrib instrumentation [#third_party_instrumentation]

The `rpm_contrib` and `newrelic_mongo` gems both provided basic instrumentation for `mongo`. New Relic does not recommend running Mongo instrumentation via these gems alongside the Ruby agent's built-in Mongo support. This might double-count metrics such as overall database time.

Also, the `rpm_contrib` and `newrelic_mongo` gems both use a distinct setting that can be used to disable them if removing those gems entirely isn't possible in your environment. For those third party gems, set `disable_mongodb: false` in your **newrelic.yml**.

## Disabling instrumentation [#Disabling_instrumentation]

To disable Mongo instrumentation in the agent, add the following to your **newrelic.yml**:

```
disable_mongo: true
```
