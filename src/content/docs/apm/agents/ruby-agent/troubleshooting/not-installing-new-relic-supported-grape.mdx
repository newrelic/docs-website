## Problem

You receive this log message that Grape is not installing:

```
INFO : Not installing New Relic supported Grape instrumentation because the third party newrelic-grape gem is present
```

## Solution

Remove the `newrelic-grape` gem.

## Cause

New Relic does not support the third-party `newrelic-grape` gem. If the Ruby agent detects the `newrelic-grape` gem, it does not install New Relic's [built-in Grape instrumentation](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/getting-started/ruby-agent-requirements-supported-frameworks). Removing the third-party gem allows you to use the the supported Grape instrumentation.
