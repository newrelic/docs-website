## Problem

You are using a Ruby gem that is incompatible with the New Relic Ruby agent.

## Solution

While New Relic strives to be compatible with all gems, there are some that will not work properly with the Ruby agent. This details incompatible gems and known workarounds.

    <DNT>**Problem**</DNT>: The [db-charmer](http://rubygems.org/gems/db-charmer) gem has incompatibilities of how it patches Rails controllers.

    <DNT>**Solution**</DNT>: Force New Relic to load and start before `DbCharmer.enable_controller_magic!` is called. For example, add the following to your <DNT>**config/application.rb**</DNT>:

    ```
    require 'newrelic_rpm'
    NewRelic::Agent.manual_start
    DbCharmer.enable_controller_magic!
    ```

  <Collapser
    id="escape_utils"
    title="escape_utils"
  >
    <DNT>**Problem:**</DNT> The [escape_utils](https://github.com/brianmario/escape_utils) gem is incompatible with automatic instrumentation for New Relic's page load timing feature (sometimes referred to as real user monitoring or RUM). Due to the way `escape_utils` monkey-patches Rack, your whole HTML response may be escaped.

    <DNT>**Solution:**</DNT> If you see HTML source instead of the rendered page, use either of these options:

    * Remove the `escape_utils` gem.
    * Use [manual instrumentation](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/features/page-load-timing-ruby#manual_instrumentation) for page load timing.

  <Collapser
    id="right_http_connection"
    title="right_http_connection"
  >
    <DNT>**Problem:**</DNT> If the [right_http_connection](http://rubygems.org/gems/right_http_connection) gem is loaded after `newrelic_rpm`, it patches the `Net::HTTP` class in a way that causes New Relic's Externals instrumentation to be missed.

    <DNT>**Solution:**</DNT> Ensure that `right_http_connection` is required before `newrelic_rpm`.

  <Collapser
    id="ar-octopus"
    title="ar-octopus"
  >
    <DNT>**Problem:**</DNT> The [ar-octopus](https://github.com/tchandy/octopus) gem changes the way ActiveRecord's connection management works, breaking the Ruby agent's ability to gather instance information, apply vendor-specific obfuscation to queries, and capture explain plans for long-running database queries.

    <DNT>**Solution:**</DNT> No known workaround. Either remove the `ar-octopus` gem, or continue to use it, in which case no explain plans will be captured.
