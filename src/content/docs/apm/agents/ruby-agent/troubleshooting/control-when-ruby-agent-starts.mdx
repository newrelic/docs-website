## Problem

The Ruby agent isn't starting or isn't reporting data to New Relic.

## Solution

To solve this problem:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="version-3-6-1-or-later"
    title="Check your Ruby agent version."
  >
    Check your [Ruby agent version](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/ruby-release-notes), and update if necessary.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="environment"
    title="Check the app environment used."
  >
    When the `newrelic_rpm` Ruby gem is required in your application environment, it will attempt to determine whether to start monitoring automatically and begin transmitting metrics to New Relic, or to remain disabled.

    * Production and staging: The agent typically is configured to monitor automatically in these environments.
    * Test and development: The agent typically remains disabled in these environments.

      To control this logic, set the `monitor_mode` configuration key to `true` or `false` in each environment section of `newrelic.yml`.
  </Collapser>

    id="forcing-start"
    title="Force the agent to start."
  >
    To override the agent's auto-start logic, the easiest mechanism is to set a `NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED=true` environment variable; for example:

    ```
    NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED=true rake assets:precompile
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="autostart-config"
    title="Customize the auto-start configuration variables."

    If you are running Ruby agent version 3.6.1 or higher, there are a few reasons the agent will refuse to start:

    * The agent detects it is in an interactive session; for example, a `rails console` or `irb` session.
    * The agent detects it is in one of Rails' built-in rake tasks; for example, `assets:precompile` or `db:migrate`.

      You can use configuration variables in your Ruby agent `newrelic.yml` file to customize auto-start behavior for constants, script names, and rake tasks.

## Problem

The Ruby agent starts in contexts where I don't want it to start.

## Solution

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="configure-where-the-agent-starts"
    title="Customize your configuration to control when the agent starts"
  >
    The Ruby agent makes some assumptions about the contexts most customers want the agent to automatically start.

    There are three configuration options available to customize this behavior:

    * [`autostart.denylisted_constants`](/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/configuration/ruby-agent-configuration/#autostart-denylisted_constants)
      Most of the constants on this list are Rails commands that perform operations that rarely benefit from monitoring.

      The list doesn't include `Rails::Command::RakeCommand`, which powers commands like [`rails db:*`](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html#bin-rails-db) as well as `rails solid_queue:start`, and other Rails commands related to Rake tasks.

    * [`autostart.denylisted_executables`](/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/configuration/ruby-agent-configuration/#autostart-denylisted_executables)
      This configuration controls executables, like `rspec` and `irb`.

    * [`autostart.denylisted_rake_tasks`](/docs/apm/agents/ruby-agent/configuration/ruby-agent-configuration/#autostart-denylisted_rake_tasks)
      Prior to Rails 5.1, `rake` was used instead of `thor` for many commands, such as `db:migrate`. The default values for this configuration lists many commands from that time. You can also add your own `rake` commands to this list.

  <Collapser
    id="manually-start-and-stop-the-agent"
    title="Manually start and stop the agent"
  >
    The [`NewRelic::Agent.manual_start`](https://rubydoc.info/gems/newrelic_rpm/NewRelic/Agent#manual_start-instance_method) API can be used to start the agent in specific contexts. If you set `:agent_enabled` to `false` in your configuration file or set the environment variable `NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED=false`, you can still manually start the agent using this API.

    ```ruby
    NewRelic::Agent.manual_start(agent_enabled: true)
    ```

    If you want to stop the agent before the process ends, you can call [`NewRelic::Agent.shutdown`](https://rubydoc.info/gems/newrelic_rpm/NewRelic/Agent#shutdown-instance_method).
