## Problem

After [installing the New Relic Ruby agent](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/installation-configuration/ruby-agent-installation), generating some traffic, and waiting five minutes, no data appears in your New Relic UI.

## Solution

To troubleshoot missing data:

1. Verify your config file:

   * Ensure your config file is installed at `config/newrelic.yml` within your application directory.
   * Ensure your config file is valid YML.
   * To download a clean copy of this file with your <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> pre-populated, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > (user menu) > Account settings > Download a clean configuration file**.
2. Restart your web server.
3. Use [New Relic Diagnostics](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/new-relic-diagnostics) to try to automatically identify the issue.
4. Examine the agent's log file at `log/newrelic_agent.log` for any errors or warnings that show up upon restarting your application server processes. If this log file isn't present or isn't being written to, see [No log file](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/troubleshooting/no-log-file-ruby).
5. Check the New Relic agent log for an entry that has `INFO : Reporting to:` followed by a URL. Ensure that URL matches the account and application you are viewing in the New Relic UI.
6. Ensure the New Relic agent is configured to start in the environment you're deploying to. For more information, see [Controlling when the Ruby agent starts](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/troubleshooting/controlling-when-ruby-agent-starts).
7. If no errors are obvious at the `info` level, [generate detailed debug logs](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/troubleshooting/generating-logs-troubleshooting-ruby).
8. Try [updating to the latest version](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/installation-configuration/updating-deprecated-ruby-agents#update) of the **newrelic_rpm** gem.
9. If you are using something other than Rails, set `RACK_ENV` to an environment appearing in the `newrelic.yml` file, such as development or production.
