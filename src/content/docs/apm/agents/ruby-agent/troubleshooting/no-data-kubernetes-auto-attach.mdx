## Problem

You are using the New Relic Ruby agent with the Kubernetes APM auto-attach for a non-Rails framework (like Sinatra), but no APM data is appearing in your New Relic account.

## Solution

Explicitly call `Bundler.require` early in your application's startup process.

For many frameworks, this can be done by adding it to your main application file or a `config.ru` file before your application classes are defined.

Example (`config.ru` or `app.rb`):

```ruby
# config.ru

require 'bundler'
Bundler.require

# ... rest of your application's startup code
require_relative './my_sinatra_app'
run MySinatraApp
```
After adding this code, redeploy your application. Data should begin appearing in New Relic within a few minutes.

## Cause

The Kubernetes APM auto-attach works by patching the `Bundler::Runtime#require` method to inject the `newrelic_rpm` gem into your application.

While Rails applications automatically call `Bundler.require` during their boot process, many other frameworks do not. If `Bundler.require` is never called, the New Relic agent is never loaded into your application's environment. Adding this line ensures the agent is loaded as expected.
