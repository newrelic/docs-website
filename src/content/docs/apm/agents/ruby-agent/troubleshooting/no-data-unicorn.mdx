## Problem

If you do not see data with Unicorn, follow these procedures based on your New Relic Ruby agent version.

## Solution

If you are using Ruby agent version 3.8.0 or higher, you should not need to do any additional configuration. If you're using a [supported web framework](/docs/ruby/supported-frameworks), the agent should work out of the box regardless of your Unicorn configuration.

If you are using a Ruby agent version **prior to 3.8.0** with Unicorn, you will need to do one of the following in order to get data reporting:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="upgrade"
    title="Upgrade to newrelic_rpm 3.8.0 or higher"
  >
    As noted above, versions 3.8.0 or higher of the newrelic_rpm gem should automatically work correctly regardless of your unicorn configuration.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="upload"
    title={<>Upload <InlineCode>preload_app true</InlineCode></>}
  >
    Use the `preload_app true` directive in your Unicorn configuration file. For more information, refer to the Unicorn [documentation for this configuration setting](http://unicorn.bogomips.org/Unicorn/Configurator.html#method-i-preload_app). You must ensure that Unicorn sees your configuration file by specifying the `-c <path>` option to your `unicorn` invocation (Heroku users: This will be in your `Procfile`).

    <Callout variant="tip">
      The directive is \`preload_app true\`, not \`preload_app = true\`. The form with the equals sign will fail silently.
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="manual-start"
    title="Manually start the agent"
  >
    If you do not want to use `preload_app true`, you can manually call the New Relic Ruby agent's handler for forking web servers from an initializer file in `` config/initializers` ``:

    ```
    # Ensure the agent is started using Unicorn.
    # This is needed when using Unicorn and preload_app is not set to true.
    # See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/ruby/no-data-with-unicorn 
    if defined?(Unicorn) && File.basename($0).start_with?('unicorn') 
       ::NewRelic::Agent.manual_start() 
       ::NewRelic::Agent.after_fork(:force_reconnect => true) 
    end
    ```

    In order for your changes to take effect, do a "clean" restart (full stop and start). Doing a normal Unicorn restart with `SIGUSR2` may not properly initialize the gem.
