## Problem

There is no New Relic logfile in `log/newrelic_agent.log`.

## Solution

If there is no `newrelic_agent.log` file, try the following steps to diagnose:

1. Verify that the agent is actually being required by your application:

   * Ensure that the `newrelic_rpm` gem line in your `Gemfile` is not marked with `require: false`, which prevents Bundler from requiring the gem. You can remove the `require: false` statement, or you can manually control the `newrelic_rpm` gem yourself by calling `require 'newrelic_rpm'` elsewhere in your code during application startup.
   * If the `newrelic_rpm` gem is in a group within your `Gemfile`, ensure that group is being loaded in the environment to which you are deploying.
   * Ensure that the `newrelic_rpm` line in your `Gemfile` is not wrapped in a conditional that evaluates to false in the environment to which you are deploying.
2. Make sure that the `log` directory within your application's root directory exists and is writable by the user that your application is running as.
3. Ensure the current working directory from which you start your app server processes is the same as the root directory for your app (that is, the current working directory should contain a `log` directory).

For debugging purposes, it may be helpful to force the agent to be enabled and send its log output to `STDOUT`. To do this, set the environment variables `NEW_RELIC_LOG=stdout` and `NEW_RELIC_AGENT_ENABLED=1` when starting your application server.
