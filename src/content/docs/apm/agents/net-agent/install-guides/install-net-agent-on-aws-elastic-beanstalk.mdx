Amazon Web Services (AWS) [Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk) is a dynamic service that allows easy deployment and scalability for your applications. Follow these instructions to deploy the .NET agent to the instances launched with your .NET AWS Elastic Beanstalk applications. You may also want to install the New Relic Infrastructure agent on your Elastic Beanstalk instances; refer to [Configure the infrastructure agent on AWS Elastic Beanstalk](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/config-management-tools/configure-infrastructure-agent-aws-elastic-beanstalk/) for more details.

## Requirements

Make sure you have a supported [Amazon Web Services account](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/). In addition, for any New Relic installation, you will need your <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" />. This is a 40-character hexadecimal string that New Relic provides when you [sign up](http://newrelic.com/signup "Link opens in a new window") for your account.


## Install the .NET agent

To install the .NET agent for ASP.NET Core web applications deployed to AWS Elastic Beanstalk, follow these steps. You can also find working example projects for both Windows and Linux in our [.NET agent samples repository](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-dotnet-examples/tree/main/elastic-beanstalk).

1. Create a `.ebextensions` folder at the root of your application and create a file named `newrelic-dotnet-agent-install.config`. (The exact filename isn't important, but it must have a `.config` extension.) 

<Callout variant="important">
  Be sure to set `Copy to Output Directory` to `Copy if newer` for this file in your project, to ensure that it gets deployed with your application.
</Callout>

2. Based on the operating system for your .NET application, add the following content to the file:
    * Replace `YOUR_LICENSE_KEY` with your New Relic license key.
    * Replace `YOUR_APP_NAME` with your application name.

        packages:  
            msi:
              # install the latest version of the New Relic .NET agent
              # To install a specific version, update the path to the msi
              dotnet: https://download.newrelic.com/dot_net_agent/latest_release/NewRelicDotNetAgent_x64.msi
        option_settings:
            aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:environment:
              CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING: '1'
              NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY: 'YOUR_LICENSE_KEY'
              NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME: 'YOUR_APP_NAME'
        ```

        The <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> and app name aren't required environment variables; they [can be set in other ways](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation/net-agent-install-resources#env-variables).

        For more details on these variables, as well as correct values for other installation scenarios, please see [understanding .NET agent environment variables](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/other-installation/understanding-net-agent-environment-variables/).

3. Deploy your application using the latest version of the [AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/visualstudio/). You can also use the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/) to deploy the application.

If your application is receiving traffic, data should appear within a few minutes. If it doesn't, see [No data appears](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-net).
