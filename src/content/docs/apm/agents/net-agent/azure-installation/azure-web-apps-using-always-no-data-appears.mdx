## Problem

You installed New Relic's .NET agent through [Microsoft Azure Web Apps](/docs/agents/net-agent/azure-installation/install-app-azure-web-apps) and are using Azure's `Always On` setting. After generating some traffic and waiting a few minutes for data collection to start for your app, data still does not appear in the APM user interface.

## Solution

Beginning with .NET agent version [8.22.181.0](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/net-release-notes/net-agent-8221810), Azure's `Always On` setting may be enabled without interfering with the agent. If you'd like to use `Always On`, simply [update the agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/azure-installation/install-net-agent-azure-web-apps).

## .NET Framework 4.0 or lower workarounds [#4-0-framework]

If your application targets [.NET Framework 4.0 or lower](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/technical-support-net-framework-40-or-lower), Azure's [`Always On` setting](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-create-web-jobs/) will interfere with the agent. This feature is only available in Azure's **Basic** and **Standard** modes.

The `Always On` setting prevents the environment variable `APP_POOL_ID` from being set. New Relic's .NET agent needs this environment variable to get the app name. If the agent cannot determine an application name, then it won't start up.

If you are still using .NET Framework 4.0 or lower, try the following workarounds:

If you are using Microsoft's **Standard** or **Basic** tiers with the Azure Portal, ensure that the `Always On` setting is disabled.

1. In the Azure Portal, select **(your app) > Settings > Application Settings**.
2. Set the `Always On` toggle to `Off`.

Here are some other options you can try. If these do not work, you **must** [turn off the `Always On` setting](#4-0-framework).

    To name your application in the local **`newrelic.config`** using Kudu:

    1. From the Microsoft Azure Portal, select **(your app) > Tools > Kudu**, then select **Go**.
    2. Select **Debug Console > CMD**.
    3. Select **Site > wwwroot > newrelic**.
    4. Select the edit <Icon name="fe-edit-2"/>
       icon for `newrelic.config`, and add:

       ```xml
       <application>
         <name>Your app's name</name>
       </application>
       ```
    5. Save and restart your application.

      This option has been found to only be a temporary fix. The .NET agent may stop reporting intermittently.
    </Callout>

    To name your application in its `app/web.config` file:

    1. Add the following key to `appSettings`:

       ```xml
       <appSettings>
         <add key="NewRelic.AppName" value="Your app's name" />
       </appSettings>
       ```
    2. Restart your instance.

    Depending on your usage of `Always On`, you can try using [Synthetic monitoring](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-synthetics) to keep your website active.

    * If you **are not** using the `Always On` setting, you can try using our synthetic monitoring free [pinger monitor](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/add-edit-monitors#monitor-type-ping).
    * If you **are** using the `Always On` setting, synthetic monitoring needs to be able to reach an endpoint for your worker roles. If it can't, you can try using a [synthetic scripted monitor](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/scripting-monitors/write-scripted-browsers) to run on your site.
