Our .NET agent supports both .NET Framework and .NET Core. Here we describe the compatibility and support for .NET Framework applications. For .NET Core, see [Compatibility and requirements for .NET Core](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation/compatibility-requirements-net-core-agent). 

The agent includes built-in instrumentation for some of the most popular parts of the .NET ecosystem, including frameworks, databases, and message queuing systems. After you [download and install](/install/dotnet) the agent, it runs within the monitored process. The agent doesn't create a separate process or service.

For frameworks and libraries that aren't [automatically instrumented](#instrumented-features), you can extend the agent with [.NET custom instrumentation](/docs/agents/net-agent/custom-instrumentation/introduction-net-custom-instrumentation).

## Requirements

Before you [install New Relic's .NET agent](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-net/#installation), make sure your system meets these requirements:

<CollapserGroup>
<Collapser
    id="lifespan"
    title="Application lifespan"
  >
    The .NET agent uploads data at the end of each [harvest cycle](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary/#harvest-cycle) (once per minute). If your .NET app doesn't run that long, you can set the `service element`'s `sendDataOnExit` attribute to `true` in the `newrelic.config` file.
</Collapser>
<Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="app-web-servers"
    title="App/web servers"
>
    You must use one of these app/web servers:

    * IIS
    * Self-hosted OWIN
    * Self-hosted WCF
    * Kestrel
    * Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModule
    * Kestrel with IIS reverse proxy via AspNetCoreModuleV2

      The agent automatically creates transactions for apps hosted in IIS. If you self-host with WCF and OWIN version 3 or higher, the agent also automatically creates transactions. For other self-hosted services, you will need to [create transactions via custom instrumentation](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/custom-instrumentation/introduction-net-custom-instrumentation/#new-existing).

<Collapser

    The agent requires CLR version 4.0. Legacy applications running on CLR 2.0 can be instrumented with agent versions lower than 7.0.

    The use of [Code Access Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/misc/code-access-security) is compatible with the .NET agent only when Full Trust is provided. The agent isn't compatible with more restrictive trust levels.

    Microsoft officially announced end of life for .NET Framework versions 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.6.1 on April 26, 2022.
    
    You can find the informational blog on the [Microsoft blog site](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-framework-4-5-2-4-6-4-6-1-will-reach-end-of-support-on-april-26-2022). You can find the official product lifecycle start and end dates in the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-framework).
    
    Our .NET agent support of these framework versions end with the latest 9.x New Relic .NET agent. Starting from the New Relic .NET agent version 10.0, we will target .NET framework 4.6.2 onwards. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our [Support Forum post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/q1-bulk-eol-announcement-fy23/181744).
  </Callout>

    **.NET Framework 4.6.2 or higher**

    .NET Framework 4.6.2 or higher require the New Relic .NET agent version 7.0 or higher.

    **.NET Framework 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.6.1**
    
    To instrument applications running on .NET Framework 4.5.1, 4.5.2, or 4.6.1, you must run a version of the New Relic .NET agent lower than 10.0 but no lower than 7.0.

    **.NET Framework 4.0 or lower**

    To instrument applications running on .NET Framework version 4.0 or lower, you must run a version of the New Relic .NET agent lower than 7.0. For more information and download procedures, see [Technical support for .NET frameworks 4.0 or lower](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/technical-support-net-frameworks-40-or-earlier).

    Here are additional details about .NET Framework versions 4.0 or lower:

    Installation requires elevated privileges (Administrator). For example, you can:

    * Be logged in as an administrator user.

    * Be a member of the Administrators group.

    * On newer operating systems, provide elevation credentials when prompted.

      The monitored process must have read/write access to the directory in which the agent is installed. The agent runs as a part of the monitored process and relies on those permissions to function.

      **Recommendation:**

    * Restrict permissions for the `newrelic.config` file and give read/write access only to the owner of the monitored process.

    * Review permissions for the logs created by the agent to minimize the number of users with access and their privileges.

## Automatic instrumentation [#instrumented-features]

If your application is hosted in ASP.NET or another [fully supported framework](#app-frameworks), the .NET agent will automatically instrument your application after install. If your app isn't automatically instrumented, or if you want to add instrumentation, use [custom instrumentation](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/custom-instrumentation/introduction-net-custom-instrumentation/).

The .NET agent doesn't directly monitor datastore processes. Also, by default the .NET SQL parameter capture in a query trace doesn't list parameters for a parameterized query or a stored procedure. Collection of the SQL query parameters can be enabled in the agent [configuration](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration/).

2. Install the Microsoft Windows Perfmon/WMI on-host integration for New Relic infrastructure by [following the nri-perfmon instructions](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-perfmon#nri-perfmon---windows-perfmonwmi-on-host-integration-for-new-relic-infrastructure).
3. If you installed Perfmon manually, [restart your infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/manage-your-agent/start-stop-restart-infrastructure-agent).
4. Go to our ADO.NET quickstart page to [install the ADO.NET dashboards](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/ado-dotnet).

If you prefer, you can [install the infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux) via the command line.
2. Get the pre-built dashboard by [installing the Blazor quickstart](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/blazor-server) 
3.  From **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**, go to **APM & services**, then select your app. To check that your installation is successful, query the following:

```sql
FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET request.uri
```

If data appears, you've instrumented your app correctly.

        For ASP.NET applications, the .NET agent automatically injects the browser JavaScript agent when you [enable auto-instrumentation](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent/#select-apm-app). After enabling browser injection, you can view browser data in the [APM Summary page](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/monitoring/apm-summary-page-view-transaction-apdex-usage-data/) and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see [Browser monitoring and the .NET agent](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/other-features/browser-monitoring-net-agent/).

        Automatic browser injection is not supported for ASP.NET core applications.
