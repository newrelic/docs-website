The following are the specific policies and dates for support of our .NET agent. See our documentation about [general EOL policies](/docs/licenses/end-of-life/notification-changes-new-relic-saas-features-distributed-software/) for information about New Relic's overall end-of-life policy.

## New Relic .NET agent releases and support dates [#net-eol]

Any versions not listed in the following table are no longer supported. Please [update your .NET agent version](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/installation/update-net-agent) to the [latest release](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/net-release-notes/).

* The 6.x agent line is maintained to support customers with applications running on .NET Framework versions earlier than 4.5, and only receives critical security patches.  Only versions 6.26 and 6.27 are supported. The EOL date for 6.x agents is the same as Microsoft's support end date for .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1.

## Microsoft .NET runtimes [#microsoft-runtimes]

For support of .NET runtimes, New Relic follows Microsoft's Lifecycle Policy for:

* [Microsoft .NET Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-framework)
* [Microsoft .NET and .NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/microsoft-net-and-net-core)
