This document contains instructions for installing New Relic's .NET agent to monitor an ASP.NET Core application. These are additional caveats and instructions that supplement the standard installation procedures for [Windows](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation/install-net-agent-windows) and [Linux](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation/install-net-agent-linux).

## ASP.NET Core apps targeting .NET Core [#core-targeting-core]

New Relic automatically instruments ASP.NET Core apps targeting .NET Core that are hosted in IIS.

For applications **not** using IIS, follow the standard installation procedures for [Windows](/docs/agents/net-agent/other-installation/install-net-agent-aspnet-core-targeting-net-framework-windows) or [Linux](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation/install-net-agent-linux) as applicable. In addition, you must enable the agent for your application and, if monitoring doesn't happen automatically, set up custom instrumentation:

* Enabling your app: See instructions [for Windows](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation/install-net-agent-windows#enabling-the-agent) and [for Linux](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation/install-net-agent-linux#enable-agent).
* Custom instrumentation: If you're not using Kestral, or if instrumentation doesn't happen by default for some other reason, you must [custom instrument your app](/docs/agents/net-agent/custom-instrumentation/introduction-net-custom-instrumentation).

## ASP.NET Core apps targeting .NET Framework [#core-targeting-framework]

For applications not hosted in IIS, or for ASP.NET Core apps targeting .NET Framework, follow the [standard installation procedure for Windows](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation/install-net-agent-windows#msi). In addition, you must follow these procedures to [explicitly enable the .NET agent](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation/install-net-agent-windows#enabling-the-agent).
