Read about how to confirm the checksum for New Relic's .NET agent installers. If you need the hashes for our current releases, [download their SHA256 hashes from our download site](http://download.newrelic.com/dot_net_agent/latest_release/SHA256/).

## Windows

On Windows, we recommended using either CertUtil or Get-FileHash to compute a file hash.

### CertUtil

This utility is available as part of Certificate Services and can be used to compute the hash of a file. This utility can be run from the Command Prompt or Powershell.

To compute the hash, run:

`CertUtil -hashfile YOUR_FILENAME SHA256`

If successful, you'll get this response:

```
SHA256 hash of <var>YOUR_FILENAME</var>:
5092fd52e40132a41ac06c320296cd9d63196d6de0fa6ce9b74fc4de1b3f9502
CertUtil: -hashfile command completed successfully.
```

### Powershell: Get-FileHash [#getfilehash]

The Get-FileHash cmdlet is included with Powershell version 5.1+ and can be used to compute the hash of a file.

To compute the hash, run:

`Get-FileHash YOUR_FILENAME Algorithm SHA256 | Format-List`

If successful, you'll get this response:

```
Algorithm : SHA256
Hash      : 5092FD52E40132A41AC06C320296CD9D63196D6DE0FA6CE9B74FC4DE1B3F9502
Path      : C:\Path\To\<var>YOUR_FILENAME</var>
```

## Linux

On Linux, we recommend using

```
sha256sum
```

to compute a file hash.

### sha256sum [#she256sum]

To compute the hash, run:

`sha256sum YOUR_FILENAME`

If successful, you'll get this response:

```
5092fd52e40132a41ac06c320296cd9d63196d6de0fa6ce9b74fc4de1b3f9502 <var>YOUR_FILENAME</var>
```
