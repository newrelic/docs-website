Read about how to confirm the checksum for New Relic's .NET agent installers. If you need the hashes for our current releases, [download their SHA256 hashes from our download site](https://download.newrelic.com/dot_net_agent/latest_release/SHA256/).

## Linux [#checksum-linux]

On Linux, run:

```sh
sha256sum YOUR_FILENAME
```

If successful, you'll get this response:

```
5092fd52e40132a41ac06c320296cd9d63196d6de0fa6ce9b74fc4de1b3f9502 YOUR_FILENAME
```

## Windows [#checksum-windows]

On Windows, we recommended using either `CertUtil` or `Get-FileHash` to compute a file hash.

    `CertUtil` is available as part of Certificate Services and can be used to compute the hash of a file. You can run it from the Command Prompt or Powershell.

    To compute the hash, run:

    ```sh
    CertUtil -hashfile YOUR_FILENAME SHA256
    ```

    If successful, you'll get this response:

    ```
    SHA256 hash of YOUR_FILENAME:

    CertUtil: -hashfile command completed successfully.
    ```

    title="Get-FileHash (Powershell)"

    The `Get-FileHash` cmdlet can be used to compute the hash of a file. It's available in Powershell version 5.1 or higher.

    To compute the hash, run:

    ```powershell
    Get-FileHash YOUR_FILENAME Algorithm SHA256 | Format-List
    ```

    If successful, you'll get this response:

    ```
    Algorithm : SHA256
    Hash      : 5092FD52E40132A41AC06C320296CD9D63196D6DE0FA6CE9B74FC4DE1B3F9502
    Path      : C:\Path\To\YOUR_FILENAME
