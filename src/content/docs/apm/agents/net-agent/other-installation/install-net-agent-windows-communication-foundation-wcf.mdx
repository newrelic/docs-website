This document explains how to install the .NET agent and monitor WCF applications.

## Install for WCF applications [#wcf]

To install the .NET agent on IIS-hosted WCF apps:

1. Install the .NET agent using [these instructions for IIS-hosted apps](/install/dotnet/?deployment=windowsInstall&docker=noDocker)

   <Callout variant="important">
     For self-hosted WCF applications (hosted as a custom Windows Service, a console app, or a Windows Forms app) you must also enable the agent. See the **Enable the agent** step in the [instructions for non-IIS-hosted apps](/install/dotnet/?deployment=windowsInstallNonIis&docker=noDocker).
   </Callout>
2. Ensure you give [each WCF app a descriptive name](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-and-configuration/naming-your-net-application#naming-non-iis).
3. Enable or disable ASP.NET compatibility mode in your WCF application depending on which type of events you want monitored:

   <CollapserGroup>
     <Collapser
       id="mode-enabled"
       title="ASP.NET pipeline events and WCF events"
     >
       When ASP.NET compatibility mode is **enabled**, the .NET agent instruments ASP.NET pipeline events as well as WCF events. In this mode, the agent provides you with a full view of your application stack.
     </Collapser>

     <Collapser
       id="mode-disabled"
       title="Only WCF events"
     >
       When ASP.NET compatibility mode is **disabled**, the .NET agent only instruments WCF events. Any activity that occurs as part of the ASP.NET pipeline will not be captured, such as agent API calls that are made outside of a WCF transaction.
     </Collapser>
   </CollapserGroup>

If your application is receiving traffic, data should appear within a few minutes. If it doesn't, see [No data appears](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-net).
