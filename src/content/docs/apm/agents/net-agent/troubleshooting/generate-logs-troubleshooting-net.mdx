New Relic's .NET agent by default stores two types of log files in the `Logs` directory at `%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\New Relic\.NET Agent\Logs` for Windows and at `/usr/local/newrelic-dotnet-agent/logs` for Linux. If you are using a NuGet package install, they will be located in the `newrelic` folder within your app's root directory. Both are needed for troubleshooting; for example, if [no data appears](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-net) in the New Relic UI for your app. If either log type is missing, some component of the .NET agent did not start.

* Agent logs: These file names begin with `newrelic_agent_`.
* Profiler logs: These file names begin with `NewRelic.Profiler`.

## Generate log files in Windows [#logs-windows]

<Callout variant="important">
  When troubleshooting your New Relic .NET agent, ensure it has been configured to generate `debug` level log files, and monitor the size of your log file closely. Logging at `debug` generates a lot of data very quickly. After reproducing your problem, return the log level to `info`.
</Callout>

If your `C:\ProgramData\New Relic\.NET Agent` is in a hidden folder, update your Windows settings so that you can see it. To generate New Relic for .NET log files:

1. Open `newrelic.config`, usually located in `C:\ProgramData\New Relic\.NET Agent` (or `%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\New Relic\.NET Agent`).
2. Change the `<log level="info" />` setting to `<log level="debug" />`.
3. Save and close the file, then wait a few minutes for the agent to read the new settings.
4. Generate a few minutes of traffic to your app.
5. If sending your log file to New Relic Support: In your New Relic support ticket, attach the `newrelic.config` file (not the text of the file), and attach the entire `Logs` folder from `C:\ProgramData\New Relic\.NET Agent\Logs` or from `%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\New Relic\.NET Agent\Logs`.
6. In `newrelic.config`, change `<log level="debug" />` to `<log level="info" />`.

## Generate Azure Web App log files [#azure_logs]

Kudu Console manages Microsoft Azure Web App log reporting. To use the Kudu Console, first log into Azure.

1. Navigate to the URL of your Azure Web app; for example:

   ```
   https://example.azurewebsites.net
   ```
2. Insert the Kudu Console URL `scm`snippet into the URL; for example:

   ```
   https://example.scm.azurewebsites.net
   ```
3. Check for the Kudu logo with a black navigation bar at the top left of the page and your Azure username at the top right of the page.

Then, to change the log level within the Kudu Console:

1. From the Kudu Console navigation bar, select the **Debug console** menu, then select either **CMD** or **PowerShell**.
2. Navigate to `D:\home\site\wwwroot\newrelic`.
3. To edit `newrelic.config`, select the pencil <Icon name="fe-edit-2"/>
   icon.
4. Change `<log level="info">` to `<log level="debug">`
5. Save the change to `newrelic.config`.
6. Wait a few minutes for the debug logs to be generated.
7. Use the same steps to switch the `log level` back to `info`.

## Collect system information [#msinfo]

In addition to agent logs, a Microsoft System Information file is also useful for troubleshooting:

1. From the Windows task bar, select **Start > Run** and enter `msinfo32`. Select **OK**.
2. After the system information page loads, select **File > Save**.
3. Wait a few minutes for the server to save the file.
4. Attach the file to your [New Relic support ticket](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/find-help-or-file-support-ticket).

## Check permissions [#permissions]

Sometimes the .NET agent will start but not be able to write to its logs because it does not have the [necessary permissions to create the log directory and log files](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/no-data-registry-key-permission-issues). Permissions management varies by environment, so you will need to work with your system administrator to verify that this is not an issue.
