## Problem

You have a .NET process that runs for less than 60 seconds and are not seeing data reported for that process.

## Solution

The APM [harvest cycle](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#harvest-cycle) is 60 seconds. For this reason, processes that run for shorter periods of time may not report data. To fix this, use the `sendDataOnExit` and `sendDataOnExitThreshold` [service elements](/docs/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration#service) in your [newrelic.config](/docs/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration#config-options-precedence). You must set the `sendDataOnExitThreshold` value to a lower amount of time than the process takes to complete.
