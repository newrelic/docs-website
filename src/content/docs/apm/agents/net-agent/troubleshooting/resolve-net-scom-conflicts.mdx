## Problem

New Relic's .NET agent reports successfully, then stops after a short period of time or a maintenance event such as an IIS reset or system reboot. If these symptoms occur and you are using Microsoft's System Center Operations Manager (SCOM), you are experiencing a SCOM profiler conflict.

## Solution

<Callout variant="important">
  Do not keep the Application Performance Monitoring (`APM`) portion of SCOM installed but disabled. This is not enough to prevent interference. You must flag it to **not** be installed.
</Callout>

To resolve SCOM profiler conflicts:

1. Remove the SCOM profiler: Uninstall SCOM, or re-install SCOM and disable the `APM` portion in the install wizard.
2. To resolve the SCOM conflict, restore the registry settings using PowerShell:

   ```
   $HKLM = 2147483650 #HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
   $reg = [wmiclass]"\\.\root\default:StdRegprov"
   $key = "SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3SVC"
   $name = "Environment"
   $value = "COR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1","COR_PROFILER={71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41}","NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=C:\Program Files\New Relic\.NET Agent\","CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1","CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A}","CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=C:\ProgramData\New Relic\.NET Agent\"
   $reg.SetMultiStringValue($HKLM, $key, $name, $value)
   $key = "SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WAS"
   $name = "Environment"
   $value = "COR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1","COR_PROFILER={71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41}","NEWRELIC_INSTALL_PATH=C:\Program Files\New Relic\.NET Agent\","CORECLR_ENABLE_PROFILING=1","CORECLR_PROFILER={36032161-FFC0-4B61-B559-F6C5D41BAE5A}","CORECLR_NEWRELIC_HOME=C:\ProgramData\New Relic\.NET Agent\"
   $reg.SetMultiStringValue($HKLM, $key, $name, $value)
   iisreset
   ```
3. Run these commands **each** time you restart your server, or create a startup script to restore these settings.
4. Recycle your app pool, or from a command prompt, run **IISRESET**.

<Callout variant="important">
  You must repair your installation each time you restart your server.
</Callout>

## Cause

Microsoft's System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) includes an Application Performance Monitoring (`APM`) feature which conflicts with New Relic's .NET agent. Both employ the .NET Profiler interface, and only one profiler can be used at a time.

If you have both SCOM and the New Relic .NET agent installed on the same Windows server, disabling or turning off `APM` in SCOM will remove some Windows registry settings that are necessary for the .NET agent to work. The .NET agent will not be able to monitor web applications on that server.
