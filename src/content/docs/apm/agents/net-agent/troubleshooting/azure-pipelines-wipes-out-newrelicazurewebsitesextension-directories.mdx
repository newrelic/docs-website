## Problem

For Azure web apps using the `NewRelic.Azure.WebSites.Extension`, and deployed with Azure Pipelines, the `newrelic` directories are deleted, so no instrumentation occurs. Further attempts to deploy using the Azure Pipeline indicate that the `NewRelic.Azure.WebSites.Extension` is already installed, so the extension cannot be re-installed using the Azure Pipeline.

## Solution

To control `newrelic` folder retention, use the following options for WebDeploy:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        **Basic solutions**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Comments**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Enable `skipAction=Delete` WebDeploy arguments.
      </td>

      <td>
        Explicitly exclude specific folders from deletion, such as the `newrelic` folders, with the following:

        Azure Pipelines UI:

        Add these arguments to the **Azure App Service deploy -> Additional Deployment Options -> Additional Arguments**

        ```
        -skip:skipAction=Delete,objectName=dirPath,absolutePath='newrelic$' -skip:skipAction=Delete,objectName=dirPath,absolutePath='newrelic_core$'
        ```

        OR

        `Pipeline.yml` file:

        add the following `input` to the WebDeploy task:

        ```yml
        AdditionalArguments: '-skip:skipAction=Delete,objectName=dirPath,absolutePath=''newrelic$'' -skip:skipAction=Delete,objectName=dirPath,absolutePath=''newrelic_core$'''
        ```

        **Note** the escaped single quotes.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Cause

If the `Remove additional files at destination` option is selected for the `AzureRmWebAppDeployment` task in the Azure Pipeline, the `newrelic` and `newrelic_core` directories are deleted from `wwwroot`, but the extension is not considered uninstalled by Azure. As a result, the next time the pipeline runs and attempts to install the extension, the pipeline displays the message `Extension 'NewRelic.Azure.WebSites.Extension' already installed.` The extension cannot run without its folders, and Azure will not re-install it because it considers it still installed.
