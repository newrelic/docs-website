## Problem

After you generate traffic and wait a few minutes, your .NET application does not report data to New Relic. In addition, there is no New Relic event log for your .NET app.

## Solution

You may be running another profiler that conflicts with New Relic. Due to the architecture of .NET, you can run only one profiler at a time.

To verify whether New Relic is conflicting with another profiler:

1. Check your application event log for errors; for example:

   ```
   NET Runtime version 2.0.50727.4234 - Failed to CoCreate profiler. Profiler CLSID: '{TRQGTQJM-KMJB-FQGP-VNGG-KUQTZWCKQ6QQ}'.
   ```

   ```
   NET Runtime version 4.0.30319.296 - Loading profiler failed during CoCreateInstance. Profiler CLSID: '{FF68FEB9-E58A-4B75-A2B8-90CE7D915A26}'.
   ```
2. Compare the CLSID in the error to New Relic's CLSIDs:

   ```
   71DA0A04-7777-4EC6-9643-7D28B46A8A41
   FF68FEB9-E58A-4B75-A2B8-90CE7D915A26
   ```
3. Do one of the following:

   * If the CLSID does not match, uninstall the other profiler.
   * If the CLSID does match, check for [CoCreateInstance permissions errors](/docs/agents/net-agent/troubleshooting/cocreateinstance-errors-no-profiler-log).

## Cause

These `NET Runtime version` errors indicate there is another .NET profiler running. The New Relic .NET agent must be registered as a profiler with the Common Language Runtime (CLR) as a profiler in order to function. The CLR calls out to the .NET agent when code is loaded, and the agent instruments the code for the method call as appropriate.
