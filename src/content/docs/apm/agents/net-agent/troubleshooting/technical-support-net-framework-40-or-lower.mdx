<Callout variant="important">
  New Relic provides **limited technical support** for customers using .NET Framework 4.0 or lower.
</Callout>

This level of support includes ensuring that the following areas are configured as expected:

* Agent configuration
* System settings
* Network access
* Permissions settings

You can perform most troubleshooting checks by using [New Relic Diagnostics](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/new-relic-diagnostics), with the exception of a few checks that must be done manually. If a New Relic Diagnostics check does find an issue, information on additional troubleshooting and potential resolutions will appear in your terminal.

## Agent version requirements [#agent-version]

To get the most out of your New Relic .NET Framework agent, make sure you follow New Relic's [compatibility and requirements](/docs/agents/net-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-net-agent) guidelines.

<Callout variant="important">
  Applications running on .NET Framework version 4.0 or lower require a New Relic .NET agent version **lower than 7.0**.
</Callout>

Download and run the appropriate install package for your [architecture](/docs/agents/net-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-net-agent#architecture):

* [32-bit installer](https://download.newrelic.com/dot_net_agent/6.x_release/NewRelicDotNetAgent_x86.msi)
* [64-bit installer](https://download.newrelic.com/dot_net_agent/6.x_release/NewRelicDotNetAgent_x64.msi)

## Agent configuration [#config]

Limited technical support to troubleshoot your basic installation and configuration includes:

1. Check if the .NET agent is present and has valid configuration files.
2. If the agent is installed, check for the agent's core `.dll`.
3. If the config file is valid, check for expected elements. For example, include a manual check that it conforms to the standards laid out in the `.xsd`.

## Instrumentation

Limited technical support to troubleshoot if instrumentation is possible includes:

1. Check if WAS registry keys and required values are present and valid.
2. Check W3SVC registry keys and required values are present and valid.
3. Check ENV (non-IIS/global environment variables) reg keys and required values are present and valid.
4. Verify if instrumentation is possible by using these key checks to determine what types of apps can be monitored.
5. Confirm that the process has the necessary environment variables loaded. For example, use a tool such as the [Microsoft Sysinternals Process Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer).

## Web app [#web-apps]

Some checks require elevated permissions. For best results, run [New Relic Diagnostics](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/troubleshooting/new-relic-diagnostics) from an admin shell.

Limited technical support to troubleshoot running web apps with the .NET agent installed includes:

1. Check for any running W3WP processes, and get their `pid`.
2. Check for key `.dll` required for instrumentation. For example, if there are any W3WP processes, check if the New Relic profiler `.dll` and `mscorelib.dll` are loaded into the process.

## Applications not hosted on IIS [#non-IIS-apps]

Limited technical support to troubleshoot apps not hosted on IIS includes:

1. When using the MSI, ensure the `Instrument all` option has been enabled.
2. Check that the custom instrumentation file has been created, is in the proper place, and is accurate. If applicable, include a manual check that it conforms to the standards laid out in the `.xsd`.

## Network access and permissions [#access]

Limited technical support to troubleshoot system network access and permissions applies to any agent version, and includes:

1. Check system network access and permissions.
2. Run collector tests. For example, check whether the URL `https://collector.newrelic.com/status/mongrel` is up and the server can connect to it.
3. Check whether the config file contains any proxy settings, if proxy info has been passed to New Relic Diagnostics, and if these settings allow for connection to New Relic collectors.
4. Check if New Relic Diagnostics is running as `admin`.

New Relic Diagnostics must run as `admin` to help ensure accuracy of some other tests. Also, `admin` rights are required to install the .NET agent.

## Agent logs [#logs]

Limited technical support to troubleshoot information available from .NET agent logs includes:

1. Gather any available agent logs.
2. Check the log level.
3. Check for known issues noted in the logs.

Troubleshooting log files may require you to work directly with [New Relic Support](https://support.newrelic.com/).

## Framework version

Limited technical support depends on which .NET agent version you are using. New Relic Support will check what framework versions of the .NET agent are installed on the system.

## Full URL in OpenRasta requests [#openrasta]

When using OpenRasta instrumentation, the full URL may be captured on instrumented requests. This may result in query strings being collected that may contain sensitive information. See security bulletin [NR19-01](/docs/using-new-relic/new-relic-security/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr19-01).
