Distributed tracing allows you to see the entire journey of your requests throughout a [distributed system](/docs/distributed-tracing/concepts/introduction-distributed-tracing). For the .NET agent, we offer two types of distributed tracing (for more details, see [How span sampling works](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works#sampling)):

* Standard (head-based sampling): Before any traces arrive, we determine a set percentage of traces to accept and analyze. This gives you a solid starting point to see how tracing can help you. It is turned on by default in .NET agents 9.0.0.0 and higher. By default, the .NET agent samples 10 traces per minute, with a max span limit of 2000 spans per minute.

* Infinite Tracing (tail-based sampling): Our cloud-based service accepts all your traces and then sorts through them to find the most important. With Infinite Tracing (tail-based sampling) we can analyze all of your data and determine which traces are the most relevant.

Whether you just want to try out standard distributed tracing (head-based sampling) or also want to set up Infinite Tracing (tail-based sampling), you need to start by setting up standard tracing.

## Standard distributed tracing [#quick-start-apm]

This is the best approach to set up [standard distributed tracing](/docs/distributed-tracing/concepts/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works/#head-based) if you haven't installed any APM agents for your services yet.

<Callout variant="tip">
  When you install the New Relic .NET agent, standard distributed tracing is turned on by default. If you prefer to turn it off, see our [configuration guide](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration).
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Identify services [#identify]

    Figure out which services touch your request so you can instrument each of them to send trace data to New Relic.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Instrument each service with an APM agent [#update-agents]

    For each service involved in your transactions, you'll perform separate installations of the agent. If some of your services use other languages, simply repeat the [installation steps](/docs/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/quick-start) for those languages.

    To start the installation routine, click the tile below. When you're finished installing each agent, return here to see tips for [viewing your traces](#view-traces).

    <TechTileGrid>
      <TechTile
        name="Start installation"
        variant="TechTile"
        to="https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace/install-data-source?account=2498654&duration=1800000&state=1697148d-af7d-0509-ff73-13e2a4b94bcf"

      />
    </TechTileGrid>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### View traces [#view-traces]

    After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are some ways to view your traces in the UI:

    <CollapserGroup>
      <Collapser
        id="entity-explorer"
        title="View traces that include a specific service"
      >
        Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service:

        1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services**</DNT>.
        2. Click your entity (service).
        3. In the left pane's <DNT>**Monitor**</DNT> section, click <DNT>**Distributed tracing**</DNT>.
        4. For details, click on an individual trace. If <DNT>**Group similar traces**</DNT> is on in the top menu, click on a trace group, and then click on an individual trace.
        5. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the `trace.id`.
      </Collapser>

      <Collapser
        id="cross-acct-traces"
        title="View traces across accounts"
      >
        To see traces that cross accounts:

        1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Traces**</DNT>.
        2. Select your entity (service) in the left pane.
        3. For details, click on an individual trace. If <DNT>**Group similar traces**</DNT> is on in the top menu, click on a trace group, and then click on an individual trace.
        4. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the `trace.id`.
      </Collapser>

      <Collapser
        id="logs-context"
        title="Examine logs related to traces"
      >
        You can bring your logs and tracing details together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With [logs in context](/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-apm-agents/), you can see log messages alongside traces in the New Relic UI.

        After you've located an interesting trace using the steps in [View traces that include a specific service](#entity-explorer) or [View traces across accounts](#cross-acct-traces), do the following:

        1. If you've enabled logs in context, click on the <DNT>**Logs**</DNT> tab (next to <DNT>**Trace details**</DNT>).
        2. To view details related to an individual log, click directly on the message.
      </Collapser>
    </CollapserGroup>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Infinite Tracing [#infinite-tracing]

[Standard distributed tracing](#quick-start-apm) for APM agents [captures up to 10 traces per minute](/docs/distributed-tracing/concepts/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works/#trace-origin-sampling), but if you want us to analyze all your data and find the most relevant traces, you can set up [Infinite Tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/infinite-tracing/introduction-infinite-tracing).

Before you start, first ensure you meet [the requirements](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/infinite-tracing/introduction-infinite-tracing#requirements).

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Complete the setup for standard distributed tracing [#install-agents-first]

    The Infinite Tracing setup builds on standard distributed tracing. So, make sure you've completed the [steps above](#quick-start-apm), and then continue with the trace observer setup.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Set up the trace observer [#provision-trace-observer]

    The trace observer is a New Relic AWS-based service that collects and analyzes all your traces. Follow the instructions in [Set up trace observer](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/infinite-tracing/set-trace-observer). When you're done, return here with your trace observer information and continue with the next step to configure the agent.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Configure the agent for Infinite Tracing [#configure-agent-inf]

    Infinite Tracing configuration settings include the standard distributed tracing plus information about the trace observer. Note that server-side configuration is not available for Infinite Tracing.

        id="dot-net-config"
        title=".NET Infinite Tracing configuration"
      >
        Here's an overview of the settings. For more help with configuration, see [.NET agent configuration](/docs/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration#distributed_tracing).

        <table>
          <thead>

    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### (Optional) Customize Infinite Tracing [#customize-inf]

    After you add the agent configuration settings, you should start seeing data in the New Relic UI. After you spend some time analyzing your data, you may want to adjust some of the features of Infinite Tracing:

    * [Configure trace observer monitoring](/docs/distributed-tracing/infinite-tracing/infinite-tracing-configure-trace-observer-monitoring)
    * [Configure span attribute trace filter](/docs/distributed-tracing/infinite-tracing/infinite-tracing-configure-span-attribute-trace-filter)
    * [Configure random trace filter](/docs/distributed-tracing/infinite-tracing/infinite-tracing-configure-random-trace-filter)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Manual instrumentation (if automatic instrumentation doesn't work) [#manual-instrumentation]

Recommendation: Before performing any custom instrumentation, read:

* [How distributed tracing works](/docs/distributed-tracing/concepts/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works)
* [Troubleshoot missing data](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-missing-trace-data)

The .NET agent automatically sends tracing data across IPC channels (message queues, for example) when it auto-instruments a client for that channel ([RabbitMQ.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/rabbitmq.client), for example).
If your services communicate using an IPC mechanism that the agent doesn't automatically instrument, you need to use the agent's distributed tracing APIs to propagate the tracing data between services.
<Callout variant="important">
  In order for the manual tracing APIs to work, the communications channel you are using must support some kind of key-value pair storage (a "carrier") associated with the transmitted messages. This is sometimes called "headers" or a "property bag", but it will depend on whatever messaging library you are working with.
</Callout>

[Here is an example](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-dotnet-examples/tree/main/custom-distributed-tracing) that you can build and run to show how this works.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="calling-service"
    title="Instrument the calling service"
  >
    To instrument the calling service:

    1. Make sure that the outbound message is sent within the context of a Transaction. [Custom instrumentation](docs/apm/agents/net-agent/custom-instrumentation/custom-instrumentation-attributes-net/) may be necessary for this.
    2. Invoke the agent API call for inserting tracing data into the message being sent (see the [InsertDistributedTraceHeaders API](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/net-agent-api/net-agent-api/#ITransaction)).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="called-service"
    title="Instrument the called service"
  >
    To instrument the called service:

    1. Make sure that the incoming message is received within the context of a Transaction. [Custom instrumentation](docs/apm/agents/net-agent/custom-instrumentation/custom-instrumentation-attributes-net/) may be necessary for this.
    2. Invoke the agent API call for accepting tracing data from the incoming message (see the [AcceptDistributedTraceHeaders API](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/net-agent-api/net-agent-api/#ITransaction)).
