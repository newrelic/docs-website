To balance the need for logs while considering disk usage, each .NET agent will limit disk usage to 250MB using log rolling. The agent will first log to the file `newrelic_agent_UNIQUENAME.log` and create the file if it doesn't exist. Once that file reaches 50MB in size, the agent will:

1. Create a new log file.
2. Roll each existing log file to a new, sequentially numbered name (up to four archived files).
3. Delete the fourth archive.

To roll the log files, the old `newrelic_agent_UNIQUENAME.log` becomes the new `newrelic_agent_UNIQUENAME.log(1)`. Then, the old `newrelic_agent_UNIQUENAME.log(1)` becomes the new `newrelic_agent_UNIQUENAME.log(2)`, and so on. The old `newrelic_agent_UNIQUENAME.log(4)` is deleted.
