Display context-sensitive APM data directly in your IDE by integrating [New Relic CodeStream](/docs/codestream/how-use-codestream/performance-monitoring#code-level) with the .NET agent. Visualize code-level production telemetry in your editor as your write and review code with this integration.

## Get started [#get-started]

First, [install](/docs/codestream/start-here/install-codestream) the New Relic CodeStream extension into your supported IDE of choice, and log in.

<Callout variant="important">
  The New Relic CodeStream integration is available in [.NET agent version 9.9.0 and higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/net-release-notes) and is disabled by default. To change this configuration, check out our [documentation](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration#code_level_metrics).
</Callout>

## Agent attributes [#attributes]

The .NET agent reports and attaches the following attributes to spans produced by your application.

<Callout variant="important">
  In some cases, the agent will directly wrap base framework code (data stores, external calls, etc.) that is invoked within your application and will not display within your IDE.
