metaDescription: Code-level metrics for .NET can be displayed in your IDE using the New Relic CodeStream extension.
---

Code-level metrics allow developers using the [New Relic CodeStream extension](/docs/codestream/how-use-codestream/performance-monitoring#code-level) to see APM data displayed contextually in their IDE, alongside individual methods in the code. This allows developers to be more proactive about addressing performance issues as they write and review code.

## Get started [#get-started]

First, [install](/docs/codestream/start-here/install-codestream) the New Relic CodeStream extension into your supported IDE of choice, and log in.

<Callout variant="important">
  With the release of .NET agent version 10.2.0, code-level metrics enabled by default. 
  
  Code-level metrics are available in [.NET agent version 9.9.0 and higher](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/net-release-notes) and are disabled by default. To change this configuration, check out our [documentation](/docs/apm/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration#code_level_metrics).
</Callout>

## Agent attributes [#attributes]

The .NET agent reports and attaches the following attributes to spans produced by your application.

<Callout variant="important">
  In some cases, the agent will directly wrap base framework code (data stores, external calls, etc.) that is invoked within your application and will not display within your IDE.
