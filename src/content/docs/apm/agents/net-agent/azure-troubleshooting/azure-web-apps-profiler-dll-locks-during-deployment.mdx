## Problem

When deploying a new version of New Relic's .NET agent (`NewRelic.Profiler.dll`) for your [Microsoft Azure Web App](/docs/agents/net-agent/azure-installation/install-app-azure-web-apps), an error message prevents you from continuing until you stop or restart the process.

## Solution

Normally the process stops, then the assets are overwritten by the assets that New Relic packs in the site root (located at `D:\Home\site\wwwroot\newrelic`) during a deployment. To resolve the problem, try either of these solutions.

    This solution is available for your Azure Web App if you are attempting to deploy a new .NET agent version over an existing version:

    1. Stop your web app to release the `.dll` file.
    2. Allow the update to proceed.
    3. Once the deploy is complete, restart the instance.

    You can install New Relic's .NET agent into your Azure Web App by using the [New Relic Site Extension](https://www.siteextensions.net/packages/NewRelic.Azure.WebSites/). (You should only need to install the extension once.)

    1. Navigate to **https&#x3A;//<var>yoursite</var>.scm.azurewebsites.net/** and select **Site Extensions**.
    2. From the **Gallery**, select the add <Icon name="fe-plus"/>
       icon, then select **New Relic**.
    3. Follow the instructions to manually [add the configuration keys](/docs/agents/net-agent/azure-installation/install-app-azure-web-apps) to your web app, and use the option that best fits your needs.

    To update the Site Extension: From the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **WebApps > (select your site) > All Settings > Extensions > New Relic**.
