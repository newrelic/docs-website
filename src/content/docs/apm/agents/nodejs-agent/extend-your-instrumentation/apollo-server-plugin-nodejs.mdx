The New Relic Apollo Server plugin instruments your Apollo Server applications to give visibility into your GraphQL payloads. This helps you uncover and diagnose the cause of your slow [GraphQL queries](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph). The supported Apollo Server version is 2.14 or later.

Our plugin records overall timings for queries and uses [distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works) to uncover the route problem. Use this instrumentation to see if the problem arises from resolving a piece of requested data or if it stems from work done on other services or databases.

## Compatibility

The New Relic plugin works with the following Apollo Server modules:

* `@apollo/server`
* `@apollo/gateway`
* `@apollo/subgraph`
* `apollo-server` (>= 2.14)
* `apollo-server-express`
* `apollo-server-hapi`
* `apollo-server-koa`
* `apollo-server-fastify`
* `apollo-server-lambda`

Other plugins may work, depending on their underlying implementation, but they have not been verified.
