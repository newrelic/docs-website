New Relic's Node.js agent collects key [metric timeslice data](/docs/data-analysis/metrics/analyze-your-metrics/data-collection-metric-timeslice-event-data) from the Node.js virtual machine (V8). These metrics give you insight into Node.js VM behavior and help you improve your application's performance. The agent also collects CPU metrics, which are often analyzed together with garbage collection (GC) metrics.

## What you need [#requirements]

New Relic requires an [additional native module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@newrelic/native-metrics) to collect Node.js VM metric timeslice data related to garbage collection, memory, and CPU. As of Node v6.1.0 the native module is not required to collect CPU metrics, as the New Relic Node.js agent collects them with `process.cpuUsage()`.

The native module can be used with:

* New Relic Node.js version 1.35.1 or higher
* Node v4 or higher
* NPM v2.0.0 or higher

To compile the native module on your deployment platform, follow the [`node-gyp` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp) procedures. Prerequisites to install native Node modules include:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        Platform
      </th>

      <th>
        Prerequisites
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Unix/Linux
      </td>

      <td>
        Python (v2.7 recommended, v3.x.x not supported), make, C/C++ compiler (such as GCC)
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        macOS
      </td>

      <td>
        Python (v2.7 recommended, v3.x.x not supported), Xcode
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Windows
      </td>

      <td>
        Python (v2.7 recommended, v3.x.x not supported), Visual C++ Build Environment
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

If you have problems installing our Node.js agent, follow the [installation troubleshooting](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-your-nodejs-installation) procedures.

## Install the native module [#install-modules]

As of v2.0.0 of the New Relic Node.js agent, the native module has become an optional dependency that attempts to install automatically.

During installation, the native module first attempts to build from source on the target machine. If the build fails, Node outputs a stack trace to the console that you can typically ignore. For Linux environments running supported versions of Node, the agent then attempts to download and install a pre-built binary.

It is possible to prevent the agent from attempting to download and install a pre-built binary. Instead, it will only attempt to build the native module. Do this by setting the `NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_DOWNLOAD` environment variable to `true` before installation with either NPM or Yarn.

```
export NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_DOWNLOAD=true
```

```
npm install @newrelic/native-metrics
```

```
yarn add @newrelic/native-metrics
```

Alternatively, use the `--no-download` flag which works with NPM.

```
npm install @newrelic/native-metrics --no-download
```

If the build fails with `NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_DOWNLOAD=true` or the `--no-download` flag set, the optional native module will not be installed.

If both environment variables are set, `NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_BUILD` will override `NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_DOWNLOAD`.

If you're using an older version, [upgrade to the latest agent version](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/upgrade-nodejs-agent), or install the native module manually:

1. Ensure a supported version of Node.js is installed. **Recommendation:** Use the latest LTS version. Do not use versions lower than the minimum supported version for the `@newrelic/native-metrics` module (v4 or higher).
2. To get all currently available metrics, ensure you are running the `newrelic` module for agent 1.37.0 or higher.
3. **Windows users:** Run the following command:

   ```
   npm install --global windows-build-tools
   ```

   If this step doesn't work, follow Option 2 in the [node-gyp module on GitHub](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#option-2) for manual installation instructions.
4. To install the native metrics module, use either of these methods:

   * Run the `npm install @newrelic/native-metrics --save` command.

     OR
   * Add the module to your app's `package.json` file.
5. Restart your app.

The Node.js agent automatically detects if the native metrics module is installed and starts using it. If you'd like to avoid installation of the native module completely, you can use the following NPM or Yarn arguments.

```
npm install newrelic --no-optional
```

```
yarn add newrelic --ignore-optional
```

## Pre-built binaries [#prebuilt-binaries]

To skip the build step and only attempt to download a pre-built binary, and to avoid seeing build errors in the console, set the `NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_BUILD` environment variable to `true` before installation.

```
export NR_NATIVE_METRICS_NO_BUILD=true
```

If working behind a firewall, you can cache pre-built binaries by setting the `NR_NATIVE_METRICS_DOWNLOAD_HOST` and `NR_NATIVE_METRICS_REMOTE_PATH` environment variables before installation.

```
export NR_NATIVE_METRICS_DOWNLOAD_HOST=http://your-internal-cache/
```

```
export NR_NATIVE_METRICS_REMOTE_PATH=path/to/download/folder/
```

Once you've set environment variables, installation can then proceed.

```
npm install @newrelic/native-metrics
```

```
yarn add @newrelic/native-metrics
```
