Our Node.js agent includes built-in instrumentation of the most popular Node.js frameworks, app servers, databases, and message queuing systems. For frameworks and libraries that aren't instrumented out of the box, you can extend the agent with our [Node.js agent API](https://newrelic.github.io/node-newrelic/API.html).

Our Node.js agent is publicly available on the [Node Package Manager (npm) repository](https://npmjs.org/package/newrelic) as well as on [GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic). Ready to try out New Relic's Node.js agent? [Create a New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup)!

## Requirements to install the agent

Before [installing the agent](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/install-nodejs-agent), check that your system meets its minimum requirements. For best performance, use the latest active long term support (LTS) version of Node.js.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="operating systems"
    title="Compatible operating systems"
  >
    The Node.js agent is compatible with the following operating systems:

    * Linux
    * SmartOS
    * macOS 10.7 and higher
    * Windows Server 2008 and higher
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="host"
    title="Hosting services"
  >
    It's also compatible with these hosting services:

    * [Google App Engine (GAE) flexible environment](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/hosting-services/install-new-relic-nodejs-agent-gae-flexible-environment)
    * AWS EC2
    * [Microsoft Azure](/docs/nodejs/nodejs-agent-on-microsoft-azure)
    * [Heroku](/docs/nodejs/nodejs-agent-on-heroku)
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="security"
    title="Security requirements"
  >
    As a standard [security measure for data collection](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/security/data-security), your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="system"
    title="System requirements"
  >
    We will support the [latest versions of Node.js releases](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases) by the beginning of the following active long term support schedule. The version support policy does not replace our general end-of-life (EOL) policy.

    The following are proposed time ranges. The actual release date may vary.

## Instrumented modules

After installation, the agent automatically instruments with our catalog of
supported Node.js libraries and frameworks. This gives you immediate access to
granular information specific to your web apps and servers.  For unsupported
frameworks or libraries, you'll need to instrument the agent yourself using the
[Node.js agent API](https://newrelic.github.io/node-newrelic/API.html).

**Note**: The latest published version may not reflect the most recent version
supported by the agent.

## AI Monitoring Support

The Node.js agent supports the following AI platforms and integrations.

### Amazon Bedrock

Through the `@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime` module, we support all models (text-only) through the `Converse` API; for `InvokeModel` API, we support the following models:

| Model | Image | Text | Vision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Amazon Titan | ❌ | ✅ | - |
| Anthropic Claude | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Cohere | ❌ | ✅ | - |
| Meta Llama3 | ❌ | ✅ | - |

Note: if a model supports streaming, we also instrument the streaming variant.


### Langchain

The following general features of Langchain are supported:

| Agents | Chains | Tools | Vectorstores |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

Models/providers are generally supported transitively by our instrumentation of the provider's module.

| Provider | Supported | Transitively |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Azure OpenAI | ❌ | ❌ |
| Amazon Bedrock | ❌ | ❌ |
| OpenAI | ✅ | ✅ |

After enabling browser monitoring injection, simply follow our [guide to installing browser monitoring with the Node.js agent](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/extend-your-instrumentation/browser-monitoring-nodejs-agent/). Once you've completed these steps, you can view your browser data in the [APM <DNT>**Summary**</DNT> page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page) and quickly switch between the APM and browser data for a particular app. For configuration options and manual instrumentation, see [browser monitoring and the Node.js agent](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/supported-features/new-relic-browser-nodejs-agent).
