Want to start monitoring your Node.js application with New Relic right away? Use this guide to find the best path to start sending your application data to New Relic.

Want to learn more before you get started? [Introduction to APM](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-apm) and [Introduction to New Relic for Node.js](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-nodejs) are a good place to start. If you'd like to learn more about the general installation process, see our [Node.js installation overview](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/install-nodejs-agent).

## What do you want to monitor? [#what]

We have a few paths to install the Node.js agent, depending on what you're monitoring.

To install the agent in a Docker container, follow [these self-guided steps](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/install-nodejs-agent-docker) using the command line. 

This process walks you through adding the agent to `package.json`, then requiring New Relic on the app-level. By the end, you'll add your license key and app name to `docker run` so the agent runs with your Docker app.

    id="server"
    title="App deployed on a server"

We've got a few different options for apps hosted on a server.

* Our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace/install-data-source?state=f535d53b-5b84-cd48-80cf-61704ad02e29) breaks down the installation into steps. It requires some interaction with the command line. 
* Our [Install the Node.js agent](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/install-nodejs-agent) doc uses the command line exclusively. You can view the same process in our [Node.js agent](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic#installation) repo.
* For apps that use the PM2 process manager, follow the [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace/install-data-source?state=ba2c3ecb-defb-e99a-c4be-47d786690d2a). If you're using a process manager that isn't PM2, then choose either the guided or manual install option.

When you're ready to monitor your app, add ` $ node -r newrelic your-program.js` to the first line of your app's code. This is especially important if you don't have root access to your app.

To install an agent for your AWS Lambda functions, our [self-guided steps](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace/install-data-source?state=9aa3d004-6f13-1477-604e-b6a2d6bb992d) provide a setup script that automatically configures AWS for you.

If you have a preference for manual installation via the command line, we currently have the option for [Legacy instrumentation for Lambda monitoring](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/enable-serverless-monitoring-aws-lambda-legacy/#node).
