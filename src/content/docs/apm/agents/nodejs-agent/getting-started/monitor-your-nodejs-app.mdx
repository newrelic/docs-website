Want to start monitoring your Node.js application with New Relic right away? Use this guide to find the best path to start sending your application data to New Relic.

Want to learn more before you get started? [Introduction to APM](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-apm) and [Introduction to New Relic for Node.js](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-nodejs) are a good place to start. If you'd like to learn more about the general installation process, see our [Node.js installation overview](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/install-nodejs-agent).

## What do you want to monitor? [#what]

<Callout variant="tip">
  Is your application running on a Kubernetes cluster? Try out our installation method using the [Kubernetes agents operator](/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/installation/k8s-agent-operator/).
</Callout>

We have a few paths to install the Node.js agent, depending on what you're monitoring.

    To install the agent in a Docker container, follow [these self-guided steps](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/install-nodejs-agent-docker) using the command line.

    This process walks you through adding the agent to `package.json`, then requiring New Relic on the app-level. By the end, you'll add your license key and app name to `docker run` so the agent runs with your Docker app.

    We've got a few different options for apps hosted on a server.

    * Our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace/install-data-source?state=f535d53b-5b84-cd48-80cf-61704ad02e29) breaks down the installation into steps. It requires some interaction with the command line.
    * Our [Install the Node.js agent](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/install-nodejs-agent) doc uses the command line exclusively. You can view the same process in our [Node.js agent](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic#installation) repo.
    * For apps that use the PM2 process manager, follow the [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace/install-data-source?state=ba2c3ecb-defb-e99a-c4be-47d786690d2a). If you're using a process manager that isn't PM2, then choose either the guided or manual install option.

      When you're ready to monitor your app, add `-r newrelic` to your app's startup command to require the agent before other modules, for example `node -r newrelic your-program.js`. This is especially important if you don't have root access to your app.

  <Collapser
    id="lambda"
    title="App deployed with AWS Lambda"

    To install an agent for your AWS Lambda functions, our [self-guided steps](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace/install-data-source?state=9aa3d004-6f13-1477-604e-b6a2d6bb992d) provide a setup script that automatically configures AWS for you.

    If you have a preference for manual installation via the command line, we currently have the option for [Legacy instrumentation for Lambda monitoring](/docs/serverless-function-monitoring/aws-lambda-monitoring/enable-lambda-monitoring/enable-serverless-monitoring-aws-lambda-legacy/#node).

So you've instrumented your app and want next steps. You might consider:

* [Configuring your Node.js agent](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration)
* [Creating custom metrics](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/extend-your-instrumentation/nodejs-custom-metrics)
* [Getting data from the Node.js virtual machine (V8)](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/extend-your-instrumentation/nodejs-vm-measurements)
* Extending your instrumentation with [custom instrumentation API](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/extend-your-instrumentation/nodejs-custom-instrumentation)
* Extending functionality with [custom transaction parameters, errors and metrics](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/api-guides/guide-using-nodejs-agent-api)
* Adding [<InlinePopover type="browser"/>](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/extend-your-instrumentation/browser-monitoring-nodejs-agent) with your Node.js agent
