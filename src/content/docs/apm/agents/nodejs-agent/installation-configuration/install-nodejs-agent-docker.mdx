You can use our Node.js agent to instrument Node.js applications deployed in Docker containers. This document explains how to build, configure, and deploy your Dockerized Node.js application that has been instrumented with New Relic.

## Instrument your container [#instrument]

With just a few additions your existing Dockerfile can be used with our Node.js agent. You'll configure the agent by running your new Docker image with environment variables set.

1. Add `newrelic` to your `package.json`:

   ```json
   "newrelic": "latest",
   ```

   Install a specific version, or use any of the other options provided by the [`package.json` format](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#dependencies). Check [the Node.js agent release notes](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/nodejs-release-notes) for information about past agent versions.
2. Depending on how your container is setup, you can edit the `ENTRYPOINT` to include `newrelic` module first with Node.js `-r/--require` flag by running `node -r newrelic YOUR_PROGRAM.js`. If you can't control how your program runs, you can load the `newrelic` module before any other module in your program by adding `require('newrelic')`.

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you have an npm script to run your program such as `npm start`, you can programmatically modify this script by running `npm pkg set scripts.start="node -r newrelic your-program.js"`.
</Callout>

3. Add the environment variable `NEW_RELIC_NO_CONFIG_FILE=true` to your Dockerfile so the agent can run without a configuration file.

<Callout variant="important">
  This environment variable is no longer required as of [v7.2.0 of the Node.js agent](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/nodejs-release-notes/node-agent-7-2-0). More information on our configuration settings and order of precedence can be found [here](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration/).
</Callout>

4. Build your Docker image the way you normally do.
5. To run your Docker app with the agent enabled, add your <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" /> and [app name](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/name-your-application) to your `docker run` command as environment variables:

   ```bash
   docker run -e NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY \
         -e NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME="YOUR_APP_NAME" \
         YOUR_IMAGE_NAME:latest
   ```

<InstallFeedback />

## Other configuration options [#configure]

<Callout variant="caution">
  Don't include your license key in your Dockerfile or Docker image. For more information, see [our documentation on license key security](/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key#license-key-security).
</Callout>

In addition to setting your application name or license key, you can set [other configuration options](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration) by starting your container with the `-e` option. For example, to enable [distributed tracing](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/introduction-distributed-tracing), use:

```bash
 docker run -e NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY=YOUR_LICENSE_KEY \
        -e NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME="YOUR_APP_NAME" \
        -e NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true \
        YOUR_IMAGE_NAME:latest
```

You can also set configuration options in your Dockerfile using `ENV` directives:

```dockerfile
ENV NEW_RELIC_DISTRIBUTED_TRACING_ENABLED=true \
    NEW_RELIC_LOG=stdout
    # etc.
```
