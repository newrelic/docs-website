To take full advantage of New Relic's latest features, enhancements, and important security patches, we recommend you update your Node.js agent to the latest version. For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the [Node.js agent release notes](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/nodejs-release-notes). The release notes include a download link when applicable, plus instructions to download and [install](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/install-nodejs-agent) the latest version.

* If the `newrelic` module is listed in your `package.json`, run `npm install`.
* If you want to target just the `newrelic` module, run `npm update newrelic`.

**Recommendation:** Test your updated version before moving it into production. If you have problems, follow the Node.js agent [troubleshooting procedures](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-your-nodejs-installation).

## Node.js version support [#node-support-v7]

Node.js v10 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v7 agent. Node.js 8 and 9 are not supported by v7. Customers running Node.js 9 and earlier have two options:

* Upgrade to a supported version of Node.js and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v7 agent's new features.
* Remain on New Relic Node.js v6 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions.

[Node.js 10 does not receive updates](https://github.com/nodejs/Release/tree/cecdcf#end-of-life-releases). Upgrade to a newer version of Node.js as soon as possible. Support for Node.js 10 has been discontinued with the New Relic Node.js agent v8.

      </td>

      <td>
        * **v1 - v5:** `max_samples_per_minute` defined the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If your application previously used `max_samples_per_minute` as an upper bound, you may need to lower the threshold to a valid maximum to avoid data being dropped on the server. We recommend less than 10k.
        * **v5:** In agent v5 and lower, `max_samples_stored` defined the maximum number of events the agent stores if it's unable to communicate with the [New Relic collector](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#collector).
        * **v6:** The new behavior of `max_samples_stored` defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. This usage of the configuration is consistent with the other APM agents.
        * **Troubleshooting tips:**  If you're missing event data, increase the value of `max_samples_stored` or revert to the default value. The value of `max_samples_stored` should not be over 10,000.

## Node.js version support [#node-support-v5]

Node.js 6 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v5 agent. Node.js 4 and 5 are not supported by v5. Customers running Node.js 4 or 5 have two options:

* Upgrade to a supported version of Node.js and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v5 agent's new features.
* Remain on New Relic Node.js v4 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions.

[Node.js 7 and 9 no longer receive updates](https://github.com/nodejs/Release/tree/cecdcf#end-of-life-releases), but New Relic will continue to support these versions of Node.js for the time being.

<Callout variant="tip">

## Feature flags as of v5 [#v5-feature-flags]

As of New Relic for Node.js v5:

* `custom_instrumentation`: This feature is no longer configurable.
* `custom_metrics`: This feature is no longer configurable.
* `synthetics`: This feature is no longer configurable.
* `native_metrics`: This feature is now controlled by the `plugins.native_metrics.enabled` configuration value.

## Upgrade to Node.js agent version 4 [#node-agent-v4]

Before upgrading to Node.js agent v4, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's [Node.js v4 migration guide on GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic/blob/819db2f3f9051960e034f36540817450f663241f/Migration%20Guide.md#upgrading-to-agent-v4).

    Major changes with Node.js v4 agent include an upgrade of the `https-proxy-agent` from v0 to v2. This dependency has been updated due to a [security issue](/docs/using-new-relic/new-relic-security/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr18-08) in the `https-proxy-agent` that the New Relic Node.js agent used. Because `https-proxy` v2 is incompatible with node v0.10 and v0.12, New Relic has deprecated those agent versions. There is no required action to migrate from v3 to v4 of New Relic's Node.js agent.

## Upgrade to Node.js agent version 2 [#node-agent-v2]

Before upgrading to Node.js agent v2, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's [Node.js v2 migration guide on GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic/blob/819db2f3f9051960e034f36540817450f663241f/Migration%20Guide.md#upgrading-to-agent-v2).

          <td>
            * **v1:** With the v1 agent, rules defined in the config properties `rules.name` and `rules.ignore` were applied in reverse order; the first rule in the list was applied last.
            * **v2:** Node.js agent v2 applies rules in the order they are defined, so the first rule in the list is applied first.
            * **Troubleshooting tips:** If you used naming rules in the v1 agent and notice problems, reverse the order of your rules in your configuration.

          <td>
            * **v1:** The v1 agent started a new transaction for each listener on an HTTP server's `request` event. In applications with multiple listeners on the `request` event, this resulted in extraneous transactions being created that almost always did not get named correctly.
            * **v2:** The v2 agent only creates a single transaction for each `request` event emitted.
            * **Troubleshooting tips:** If you used multiple `request` event listeners and added a call to `newrelic.ignoreTransaction()` to remove the extra transactions, remove those calls.

            * **v1:** The v1 agent swallowed unhandled `error` events emitted by outbound HTTP request objects.
            * **v2:** The v2 agent removes this behavior. Instead, the v2 agent does not change normal Node.js execution. This means the `error` event will always be emitted.
            * **Troubleshooting tips:** If you are making outbound requests and currently do not listen for the `error` event, add a listener and handle the error as appropriate for your application.

    In `newrelic.js`, edit the [Node.js agent configuration](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration) properties you use for compatiblity with the latest versions:

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th width={200}>
            **Deprecated property**
          </th>

            **New property**

          <td>
            `capture_params`
          </td>

          <td>
            `attributes.enabled: false`

            By default, request attributes are not sent to New Relic. Set `attributes.enabled: true` to include agent-defined or custom attributes in traces. The `capture_params` property has been deprecated.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            `ignored_params`
          </td>

          <td>
            `attributes.exclude: []`

            Add any request attribute keys to the `attributes.exclude` list. Now, instead of having to be an exact match, wildcards (`*`) may be appended to each item for broader filtering. The `ignored_params` property has been deprecated.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    These [Node.js agent configuration](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration) properties also have overrides for specific destinations, including:

    * `transaction_tracer`
    * `transaction_events`
    * `error_collector`
    * `browser_monitoring`

      For example, if the root `attributes.enabled` is `true` and you set `transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled: false`, this will restrict attributes from being collected in transaction traces, while still allowing them for all others.

    The following methods from the Node.js agent have been deprecated, and New Relic has deleted them in v5 of the agent. Each has an easy replacement that accomplishes the same task in a more flexible and reliable way.

        This method gets a reference to the currently running transaction. Use in conjunction with:

        * `newrelic.startWebTransaction`
        * `newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction`
        * Callback-based message consumer services for [troubleshooting message consumers](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-message-consumers)
      </Collapser>

      <Collapser

        title={<><InlineCode>newrelic.startWebTransaction()</InlineCode><InlineCode>newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction()</InlineCode></>}
      >
        These new API methods replace the older `create*Transaction` methods. They are easier to use and seamlessly work with promises. Unlike the v1 method, the provided callback is invoked immediately.

        Use these methods to add custom instrumentation for third party modules, including those already instrumented by the New Relic Node.js agent.

  <Collapser
    id="node-support"
    title="Node.js version support for v2"

    The earliest version of Node.js supported by the New Relic Node.js v2 agent is 0.10. Node.js 0.8, which has not been updated since July of 2014, is not supported by v2. Customers running Node.js 0.8 have two options:

    * Upgrade to a supported version of Node.js and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v2 agent's new features.
    * Remain on New Relic Node.js v1 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions.

      [Node.js 0.10 also no longer receives updates](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS/tree/2b4253#lts-schedule1), but New Relic will continue to support this version of Node.js for the time being.

      **Recommendation:** Upgrade to a newer version of Node.js as soon as possible.

  <Collapser
    id="npm-versions"
    title="npm version support as of v2"

    The New Relic Node.js agent now requires npm version 2.0.0 or higher. This version of npm comes packaged with Node.js 0.10.44 or higher.

    If you are using an earlier version of Node.js 0.10 you will need to first install npm 2.0.0 or higher, or upgrade to a newer version of Node. To install npm version 2:

    ```
    $ npm install --global npm@2
    ```
