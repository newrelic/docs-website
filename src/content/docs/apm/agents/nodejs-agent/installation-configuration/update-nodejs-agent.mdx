To take full advantage of New Relic's latest features, enhancements, and important security patches, we recommend you update your Node.js agent to the latest version. For additional information about specific agent updates, refer to the [Node.js agent release notes](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/nodejs-release-notes). The release notes include a download link when applicable, plus instructions to download and [install](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/install-nodejs-agent) the latest version.

* If the `newrelic` module is listed in your `package.json`, run `npm install`.
* If you want to target just the `newrelic` module, run `npm update newrelic`.

**Recommendation:** Test your updated version before moving it into production. If you have problems, follow the Node.js agent [troubleshooting procedures](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-your-nodejs-installation).

## Upgrade to Node.js agent version 8 [#node-agent-v8]

## Node version support [#node-support-v8]

Node v12 is the earliest version supported by the New Relic Node.js v8 agent. Node 10 and 11 are not supported by v8. Customers running Node 11 and earlier have two options:

* Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v8 agent's new features.
* Remain on New Relic Node.js v7 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. The next major version of the New Relic Node.js agent will likely remove support for Node 12.
</Callout>

## Upgrade to Node.js agent version 7 [#node-agent-v7]

* Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v7 agent's new features.
* Remain on New Relic Node.js v6 agent without the ability to use new features only available with update agent versions.

[Node 10 does not receive updates](https://github.com/nodejs/Release/tree/cecdcf#end-of-life-releases). Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible. Support for Node 10 has been discontinued with the New Relic Node.js agent v8.

      </td>

      <td>
        * **v1 - v5:** `max_samples_per_minute` defined the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If your application previously used `max_samples_per_minute` as an upper bound, you may need to lower the threshold to a valid maximum to avoid data being dropped on the server. We recommend less than 10k.
        * **v5:** In agent v5 and lower, `max_samples_stored` defined the maximum number of events the agent stores if it's unable to communicate with the [New Relic collector](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#collector).
        * **v6:** The new behavior of `max_samples_stored` defines the maximum number of events the agent collects per minute. If there are more than this number, the agent collects a statistical sampling. This usage of the configuration is consistent with the other APM agents.
        * **Troubleshooting tips:**  If you're missing event data, increase the value of `max_samples_stored` or revert to the default value. The value of `max_samples_stored` should not be over 10,000.

## Feature flags as of v5 [#v5-feature-flags]

As of New Relic for Node.js v5:

* `custom_instrumentation`: This feature is no longer configurable.
* `custom_metrics`: This feature is no longer configurable.
* `synthetics`: This feature is no longer configurable.
* `native_metrics`: This feature is now controlled by the `plugins.native_metrics.enabled` configuration value.

## Upgrade to Node.js agent version 4 [#node-agent-v4]

Before upgrading to Node.js agent v4, review this information for major changes. Also see New Relic's [Node.js v4 migration guide on GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/node-newrelic/blob/819db2f3f9051960e034f36540817450f663241f/Migration%20Guide.md#upgrading-to-agent-v4).

    Major changes with Node.js v4 agent include an upgrade of the `https-proxy-agent` from v0 to v2. This dependency has been updated due to a [security issue](/docs/using-new-relic/new-relic-security/security-bulletins/security-bulletin-nr18-08) in the `https-proxy-agent` that the New Relic Node.js agent used. Because `https-proxy` v2 is incompatible with node v0.10 and v0.12, New Relic has deprecated those agent versions. There is no required action to migrate from v3 to v4 of New Relic's Node.js agent.

            * **v2:** The v2 agent only creates a single transaction for each `request` event emitted.
            * **Troubleshooting tips:** If you used multiple `request` event listeners and added a call to `newrelic.ignoreTransaction()` to remove the extra transactions, remove those calls.

            Add any request attribute keys to the `attributes.exclude` list. Now, instead of having to be an exact match, wildcards (`*`) may be appended to each item for broader filtering. The `ignored_params` property has been deprecated.

    These [Node.js agent configuration](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration) properties also have overrides for specific destinations, including:

    * `transaction_tracer`
    * `transaction_events`
    * `error_collector`
    * `browser_monitoring`

    For example, if the root `attributes.enabled` is `true` and you set `transaction_tracer.attributes.enabled: false`, this will restrict attributes from being collected in transaction traces, while still allowing them for all others.

        This method gets a reference to the currently running transaction. Use in conjunction with:

        * `newrelic.startWebTransaction`
        * `newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction`
        * Callback-based message consumer services for [troubleshooting message consumers](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-message-consumers)

        title={<><InlineCode>newrelic.startWebTransaction()</InlineCode><InlineCode>newrelic.startBackgroundTransaction()</InlineCode></>}
      >
        These new API methods replace the older `create*Transaction` methods. They are easier to use and seamlessly work with promises. Unlike the v1 method, the provided callback is invoked immediately.

        Use these methods to add custom instrumentation for third party modules, including those already instrumented by the New Relic Node.js agent.

    id="node-support"
    title="Node version support for v2"

    The earliest version of Node supported by the New Relic Node.js v2 agent is 0.10. Node 0.8, which has not been updated since July of 2014, is not supported by v2. Customers running Node 0.8 have two options:

    * Upgrade to a supported version of Node and take advantage of the New Relic Node.js v2 agent's new features.
    * Remain on New Relic Node.js v1 agent without the ability to use new features only available with updated agent versions.

    [Node 0.10 also no longer receives updates](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS/tree/2b4253#lts-schedule1), but New Relic will continue to support this version of Node for the time being.

    **Recommendation:** Upgrade to a newer version of Node as soon as possible.

    The New Relic Node.js agent now requires npm version 2.0.0 or higher. This version of npm comes packaged with Node 0.10.44 or higher.

    If you are using an earlier version of Node 0.10 you will need to first install npm 2.0.0 or higher, or upgrade to a newer version of Node. To install npm version 2:

    ```
    $ npm install --global npm@2
    ```
