Learn about special considerations for using Microsoft Azure Web Apps as a hosting service with New Relic's Node.js agent.

## What you need [#compatibility]

In addition to the [Compatibility and requirements for the Node.js agent](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/getting-started/compatibility-requirements-nodejs-agent), this tutorial assumes you have a working installation of Node.js and the Windows Azure SDK for Node.js for your platform:

* Install the Azure SDK for Node.js.
* Ensure Git is installed.

## Installing the Node.js agent [#install_nodejs]

To add the New Relic Node.js agent to your Azure application:

1. In your app's root, verify that there is a `package.json` file. If there's none, create one by running:

   ```bash
   touch package.json
   ```
2. Add the following to your `package.json` file:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "node",
     "version": "0.0.1",
     "dependencies" : {
       "newrelic" : "*"
     },
     "engine": {
       "node": "10.18"
     }
   }
   ```
3. To make sure the `newrelic` module is loaded first, use Node.js `-r/--require` flag to run the following:
  ```shell
  node -r newrelic server.js
  ```

## Adding app settings in Azure [#azure_settings]

After installation, you must configure your app in Azure Web Apps:

1. Sign in to **[portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)**.
2. Select **App Services > (select a Node.js app) > Configure**.
3. Add the following to the **app settings**:

   * `new_relic_app_name`: Your Windows Azure website name
   * `new_relic_license_key`: Your New Relic <InlinePopover type="licenseKey" />
4. Save your settings.
5. Restart your Node.js app.

Generate some traffic to your app and wait a few minutes. After waiting, see your data by going to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services > (select your app)**.

## Optional: Adding app settings with the CLI [#app_settings]

Optional: Here is an example of how to add the app settings by using the CLI (Node.js SDK):

```bash
azure account download "YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME"
azure account import "PATH_TO_PUBLISH_SETTINGS_FILE"
azure site config add "new_relic_app_name=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_APP_NAME"
azure site config add "new_relic_license_key=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_LICENSE_KEY"
azure site restart AZURE_WEB_APP_NAME
```

## Using environment variables [#variables]

If your agent runs in PaaS environments such as Heroku or Azure Web Apps, all of the configuration variables in `newrelic.js` have counterparts that can be set as environment variables. You can freely mix and match variables in the configuration file. Environment variables [override your configuration file settings](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration#methods-and-precedence).

For example, as a convenience to Azure users, the agent will use `APP_POOL_ID` as the application name ([`NEW_RELIC_APP_NAME`](/docs/nodejs/configuring-nodejs-with-environment-variables#app_name)) if it's set, so you can use the name you chose without setting it twice. For more information, see [Configuring Node.js with environment variables](/docs/nodejs/configuring-nodejs-with-environment-variables).
