  title="EOL NOTICE"
  >
 From April 2022, we don't support the C SDK capability. For more details, see our [Support Forum post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/q1-bulk-eol-announcement-fy23/181744).
</Callout>

Your C application requires two configuration values:

* Application's name: [`app_name`](https://newrelic.github.io/c-sdk/struct__newrelic__app__config__t.html#a0543f501cfec009c483be0c6d5d511f7)
* New Relic <LicenseKey/>: [`license_key`](https://newrelic.github.io/c-sdk/struct__newrelic__app__config__t.html#aac3c5f9a0e5da64836a806c47b954b71)

All other configuration values are optional, and typically the default settings do not need to be changed. However, when necessary, you can adjust New Relic's C SDK configuration.

This document is a quick reference for using some basic configuration options with the C SDK API. For detailed information about changing your configuration settings, including code values and examples, see the [C SDK's configuration GUIDE.md on GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/c-sdk/blob/master/GUIDE.md#configuration).

## Change configuration settings [#change-config]

Here are examples of some available configuration options you can change, as defined in the C SDK's public header, [`libnewrelic.h`](https://newrelic.github.io/c-sdk/libnewrelic_8h.html).

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "300px" }}>
        C SDK configuration options
      </th>

    <tr>
      <td>
        General configuration settings
      </td>

      <td>
        To set or change the app name, set the <LicenseKey/>, logging level, transaction tracing, datastore tracing, etc., use:

        `newrelic_app_config_t`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Additional transaction tracing configuration
      </td>

      <td>
        To enable the transaction tracer and to configure what transaction durations are considered for reporting a trace to New Relic, use:

        `newrelic_transaction_tracer_config_t`
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Datastore segments
      </td>

      <td>
        To configure whether a database name and datastore instance name are reported, use:

        [`newrelic_datastore_segment_config_t`](https://newrelic.github.io/c-sdk/structnewrelic__datastore__segment__config__t.html)
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Communication with the C SDK
      </td>

      <td>
        To set the socket endpoint for agent-to-daemon communications, use:

        `newrelic_init`
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Change app name (alias) in UI [#change-ui]

You can change your [application's alias](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/name-your-application#differences) from the **Application** settings page in the New Relic UI. This is useful, for example, to give your application a different name, yet keep historic data under the new alias. For more information, see [Name your application](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/name-your-application).

New Relic's C SDK does not support [server-side configuration](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/configuration/server-side-agent-configuration). However, you can also use this **Application** settings page in the UI to set your application's [Apdex T](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measure-user-satisfaction) threshold.

To change the application's alias or Apdex T threshold in the UI go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services > (select an app) > Settings > Application**.

## Change app name in configuration [#change-app-name]

If you change your application's name in your configuration settings, this will result in the same app appearing in the UI with a new name. Any historic data (based on the [data retention](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/apm-data-retention) schedule) will only exist under the old name. (To rename your application but still keep historic data, use the [UI settings](#change-ui) to change the alias.)

If you need to change your application's name in your configuration after your application is connected to the daemon:

1. Make a new `config` with a call to [`newrelic_create_app_config()`](https://newrelic.github.io/c-sdk/libnewrelic_8h.html#af067b3ff89a40b6fa417e18be5e847aa) using the new application name.
2. Make a new connected app with a call to [`newrelic_create_app()`](https://newrelic.github.io/c-sdk/libnewrelic_8h.html#a61dd90439ae3cc5060021f6ab4701132).

<Callout variant="caution">
  Timing is everything. Switching application names during a single application execution may mean that your instrumented data is sent under the new application name.
</Callout>

## View logs for your APM and infrastructure data [#logs-context]

You can also bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With [logs in context](/docs/logs/logs-context/c-sdk-configure-logs-context/), you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your [infrastructure data](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/), such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page.
