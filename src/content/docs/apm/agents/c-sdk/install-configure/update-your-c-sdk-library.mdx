To ensure you've the most up-to-date version of the New Relic C SDK for your application's code library, check the [release notes](/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/c-release-notes).

## Update your C SDK code library [#update-production]

To update your application's code library to the latest version of New Relic's C SDK:

1. Review the C SDK library changes to verify your code is compatible.
2. Manually update the code for your app as applicable.
3. Compile the C SDK code, using the [`make`](https://github.com/newrelic/c-sdk#building) command, to create the latest version of the `libnewrelic.a` and link it into your application or service.
4. If applicable, redeploy your application to your test environment.
5. Generate traffic for your application, then check your its `c_sdk.log` file and `newrelic-daemon.log` output for any errors.
6. Redeploy your application to your production environment.
7. Wait a few minutes for your application to send data to New Relic. Then, check your application's performance in [New Relic](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page).

If no data appears within a few minutes, follow the [troubleshooting tips](/docs/apm/agents/c-sdk/troubleshooting/no-data-appears-c-sdk).
