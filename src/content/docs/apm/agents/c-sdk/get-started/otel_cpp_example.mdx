OpenTelemetry C++ is an exciting observability [solution](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp) with stable functionality and a wide base of contributors in an active codebase. New Relic is [compatible](/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/introduction-opentelemetry-new-relic/) with OpenTelemetry and the [benefits](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-introduction/) it can provide, such as future proofing code by putting end-point agnostic instrumentation calls versus adhering to vendor-specific formats.

Please see the [New Relic OpenTelemetry setup](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-setup/) for detailed instructions on how to use OpenTelemetry to work with the language of your choice to send data to New Relic.

The OpenTelemetry C++ repository has many fine [examples in GitHub](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/tree/main/examples). See its [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for further instructions on building and using the OpenTelemetry C++ SDK as well as building and running the examples.

## Quick start example [#quick-start]

Want to get started right away and see what New Relic can do without having to instrument your code? Follow the steps below for an example that will have you sending data to New Relic in no time.

When you're ready to start instrumenting, please refer to the [New Relic OpenTelemetry setup instructions](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-setup/) and the OpenTelemetry C++ repository [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for further details on integrating with your code.

### 1. Set up your environment [#environment]

Ensure you have the prerequisites outlined in the [New Relic OpenTelemetry documentation](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-setup/#prereqs).

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-cpp`.
2. Copy the `Dockerfile.ubuntu`, `docker-compose-collector.yaml`, and the `config.dev.yaml` example files to the root of the directory cloned in step 1.
3. Edit `config.dev.yaml` with your [license key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-license-key) and [endpoint](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-setup/#review-settings).
4. Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose-collector.yaml up`.
5. Verify the two containers are running, one for the collector and one for the C++ application.

### 2. Run the C++ application [#run-app]

Open a terminal in the C++ container and run the following commands:

1. `cd /usr/src/myapp`
2. `mkdir build`
3. `cd build`
4. `rm -rf *`

   ```bash
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
         -DWITH_METRICS_PREVIEW=ON \
         -DWITH_LOGS_PREVIEW=ON \
         -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-Wno-error=deprecated-declarations" \
         -DWITH_OTLP=ON \
         ..
   ```
5. `cd examples`
6. `make`
7. `cd otlp`
8. `./example_otlp_http`

### 3. View your data [#view-data]

Verify data has arrived by querying your New Relic account data:

1. To see span data: Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Query your data**</DNT> and enter this query:

   ```sql
   FROM Span SELECT * where telemetry.sdk.name = 'opentelemetry'
   ```

2. View the [OpenTelemetry service](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-view-your-data#explorer) by searching for `unknown_service` for more details.
