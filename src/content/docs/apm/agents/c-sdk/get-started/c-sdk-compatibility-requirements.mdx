<Callout
  variant="important"
  title="EOL NOTICE"
  >
  From April 2022, we don't support the C SDK capability. For more details, see our [Support Forum post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/q1-bulk-eol-announcement-fy23/181744).
</Callout>

New Relic's C SDK provides a generic library you can customize to communicate with New Relic. Before you install New Relic's C SDK, make sure your system meets these requirements. Also refer to the [C SDK licenses documentation](/docs/c-sdk-licenses).

Want to try out our C SDK? [Create a New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup) for free! No credit card required.

## Language versions [#language-release]

The C SDK allows you to instrument any application on Linux, provided:

* You must have access to the source code.
* The target language must be able to import C libraries.

You can use the C SDK to create instrumentation for applications written in C and C++. You can also use it in languages like Perl, which are implemented in C or C++, and in any language that has a foreign function interface with C.

## Operating environments [#operating-systems]

The C SDK works in 64-bit Linux operating systems with:

* gcc 4.8 or higher
* glibc 2.17 or higher
* Kernel version 2.6.26 or higher
* libpcre 8.20 or higher
* libpthread
* cmake 2.8 or higher

Compiling the New Relic daemon requires Go 1.7 or higher.

## License key [#license]

You will need a New Relic <LicenseKey/> for the account you want to report data to.

## Processor type [#processor]

* Intel (and compatible) platforms only
* Support for SSE2 instructions is required

## Security requirements [#security]

As a standard [security measure for data collection](/docs/accounts-partnerships/new-relic-security/security/data-security), your app server must support SHA-2 (256-bit). SHA-1 is not supported.

## Database and instance-level performance [#datastores]

You can collect [instance details for a variety of databases and database drivers](/docs/apm/applications-menu/features/analyze-database-instance-level-performance-issues). You can also view slow query trace details for the following SQL-based database platforms:

* Firebird
* Informix
* Microsoft SQL Server
* MySQL
* Oracle
* Postgres
* SQLite
* Sybase
