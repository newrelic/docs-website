## Problem

You [installed the New Relic C SDK](/docs/install-c-agent-compile-link-your-code), generated traffic for your app, and waited a few minutes, but you still do not see data reporting in APM.

## Solution

These troubleshooting tips are approximately ordered from the most common to least common issue.

1. Check the output in the [C SDK and daemon log files](/docs/generate-logs-troubleshooting-c-sdk) for errors.
2. Make sure the [daemon process (`newrelic-daemon`)](/docs/install-c-sdk-compile-link-your-code#daemon) is up and running so that it is invoked **before** starting your instrumented application.
3. Verify your app's name and <LicenseKey/> in your [C SDK configuration](/docs/c-sdk-configuration).
4. Make sure you call:

   * [`newrelic_create_app()`](https://newrelic.github.io/c-sdk/libnewrelic_8h.html#a61dd90439ae3cc5060021f6ab4701132)
   * [`newrelic_start_web_transaction()`](https://newrelic.github.io/c-sdk/libnewrelic_8h.html#adbf7c1fa57482f6e0a7f291e0b5ec80f) or [`newrelic_start_non_web_transaction()`](https://newrelic.github.io/c-sdk/libnewrelic_8h.html#a88648cc287f8d7e371139dc3809b7afb) as applicable
   * [`newrelic_end_transaction()`](https://newrelic.github.io/c-sdk/libnewrelic_8h.html#acbd88933d620c21b7b19f12b6f042da8)

   Also make sure none of these calls returns `false` or `NULL`.
5. If necessary, check the C SDK version using [`newrelic_version()`](https://newrelic.github.io/c-sdk/libnewrelic_8h.html#a8aec87e54af38e466fc5f715ef591d10), and [update your C SDK library](/docs/update-your-c-sdk-library) to the latest release.
