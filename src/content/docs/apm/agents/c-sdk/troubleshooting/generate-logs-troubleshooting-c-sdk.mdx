  title="EOL NOTICE"
  >
From April 2022, we don't support the C SDK capability. For more details, see our [Support Forum post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/q1-bulk-eol-announcement-fy23/181744).
</Callout>

## Problem

You encounter problems sending data to New Relic with an application instrumented with the C SDK, but you are not sure what the cause is.

## Solution

The New Relic C SDK and its daemon have their own logs:

* **C SDK logs:** These logs are generated due to errors in how you've instrumented your code using the New Relic C SDK API calls.
* **Daemon logs:** These are logs related to transmission of data to New Relic.

To help troubleshoot an issue, we recommend generating logs at their highest level:

1. Set the [C SDK log](#c-sdk-logs) to `verbose` level and the [daemon log](#daemon-logs) to `debug` level.
2. Run both logs for 5-10 minutes.
3. After generating logs for troubleshooting, return logging for both the C SDK and daemon to their default levels.

<Callout variant="caution">
  Elevated logging levels can create large log files and have a performance impact. Generate logs at this level only as long as necessary for troubleshooting.

    The C SDK has four log levels, as defined by the `enum _newrelic_loglevel_t` in `libnewrelic.h`. By default, logs are set to `NEWRELIC_LOG_INFO` and output to standard error. Log levels include:

    ```
    NEWRELIC_LOG_ERROR
    NEWRELIC_LOG_WARNING
    NEWRELIC_LOG_INFO (default)
    NEWRELIC_LOG_DEBUG
    ```

    To set a different log level for troubleshooting purposes: Call [`newrelic_configure_log()`](https://newrelic.github.io/c-sdk/libnewrelic_8h.html#a8922f48a2b92714fb2fc05ad7bd5c003) in your application code, and set a log level. For example:

    ```
    newrelic_configure_log("./c_sdk.log", NEWRELIC_LOG_INFO);
    ```

    The C SDK daemon has four log levels. By default, logs are set to `info` and output to standard error. Log levels include:

    ```
    error
    warning
    info (default)
    debug
    ```

    These log levels are invoked using flags from the command line:

    ```
    --logfile <DAEMON_FILE_NAME>. Sets the path to the log file.
    --loglevel <LOG_LEVEL>. Sets the log level. Default: info.
    ```

    To set a different log level for troubleshooting purposes: From the command line, set a different log level flag. For example:

    ```
    ./newrelic-daemon -f -logfile stdout -loglevel debug
    ```
