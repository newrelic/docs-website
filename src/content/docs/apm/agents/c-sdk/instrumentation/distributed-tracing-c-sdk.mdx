<Callout
  variant="important"
  title="EOL NOTICE"
  >
  As of April 2022, we're discontinuing support for several capabilities, including the C SDK. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/q1-bulk-eol-announcement-fy23/181744).
</Callout>

Distributed tracing allows you to see the entire journey of your requests throughout a [distributed system](/docs/distributed-tracing/concepts/introduction-distributed-tracing). The [C SDK](https://github.com/newrelic/c-sdk) supports [standard distributed tracing](/docs/distributed-tracing/concepts/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works/#head-based) with head-based sampling. It doesn't support the feature called Infinite Tracing or W3C Trace context.

The C SDK requires you to manually instrument your C services, unlike the auto-instrumentation of other New Relic agents. This means you need to add some lines to your code to use the C SDK, and then you add an additional configuration to enable distributed tracing.

Here's how to get started:

* [Instrument a sample program (recommended):](#quick-start-apm) A fast way to get started
* [Manual instrumentation:](#manual-instrumentation) Tips for additional instrumentation

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you want to get more background before getting started, check out these topics:
  * [How span sampling works](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/get-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works#sampling) explains distributed tracing options.
  * [Impacts to APM](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/transition-guide-distributed-tracing) tells you what to expect if you are a current APM user but haven't set up distributed tracing.
</Callout>

## Instrument a sample program (recommended): [#quick-start-apm]

This is a quick way to see how to install the C SDK and instrument a service with [standard distributed tracing](/docs/distributed-tracing/concepts/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works/#head-based). 

Before you get started with the main steps:

* You'll need a New Relic account to set up distributed tracing. If you don't already have one, you can quickly [create a free account](https://newrelic.com/signup). Note that this link will take you to another site to complete the sign-up, but you can return here and follow the setup steps below.
* Make sure you meet the [requirements](/docs/apm/agents/c-sdk/get-started/c-sdk-compatibility-requirements).

### Step 1. Identify services

Figure out which services touch your request so you can instrument each of them to send trace data to New Relic.

### Step 2. Instrument each service with an APM agent [#update-agents]

We have an example of how to install the C SDK and instrument a sample app so it begins to report telemetry to New Relic. Once you understand how it works, you can apply the principles to each of your C services that are involved in your requests. If some of your services use other languages, simply follow the [installation steps](/docs/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/quick-start) for those languages.

Before going to the sample service below, note that it will have you create a default [`newrelic_app_config_t`](https://newrelic.github.io/c-sdk/structnewrelic__app__config__t.html), but you'll also need to add `distributed_tracing.enabled` and set it to `true`:

```
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

/*
* A standalone example that demonstrates to users how to
* configure logging, configure an app, connect an app,
* start a transaction and a segment, and cleanly destroy
* everything.
*/
#include "libnewrelic.h"

int main(void) {
  newrelic_app_t* app;
  newrelic_txn_t* txn;
  newrelic_app_config_t* config;
  newrelic_segment_t* seg;

  config = newrelic_create_app_config("<YOUR_APP_NAME>", "9931ae06b54780ab846c16fc602b5778ead3907f");
  <var>config->distributed_tracing.enabled = true;</var>
  ...

```

</TechTileGrid>

### Step 3. View traces [#view-traces]

After you instrument each of your services with APM agents, generate some traffic in your application so we can capture some traces. Here are some ways to view your traces in the UI:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="entity-explorer"
    title="View traces that include a specific service"
  >
    Here's one way you can see traces for a particular service:

    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/)**.
    2. In the left pane, click **APM &amp; services**.
    3. Click your service.
    4. In the left navigation's **Monitor** section, click **Distributed tracing**.
    5. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the `trace.id`.
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    id="cross-acct-traces"
    title="View traces across accounts"
  >
    To see traces that cross accounts:

    1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/)**.
    2. If **Traces** isn't in the left pane, click **All capabilities**, and then in the **Traces** tile, click the pin icon to insert it.
    3. In the left pane, click **Traces**.
    4. Select your entity in the left pane.
    5. If you don't see the traces you want, you can filter by the `trace.id`.
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    id="logs-context"
    title="Examine logs for trace details"
  >
    You can bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With [logs in context](/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-apm-agents/), you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI.

    1. From the **Transactions** page, click on a trace to go to the [**Trace details** page](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/transaction-traces-trace-details-page).
    2. From the trace details page, click **See logs**.
    3. To view details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

For more help finding your traces in the UI:

* [Understand and use the distributed tracing UI](/docs/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-ui)
* [Query distributed trace data](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/ui-data/query-distributed-trace-data)

## Manual instrumentation [#manual-instrumentation]

**Recommendation:** Before performing any custom instrumentation, read:

* [How distributed tracing works](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/how-new-relic-distributed-tracing-works)
* [Troubleshoot missing data](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-missing-trace-data)

If a service is not passing the trace header to other services, you can use the distributed tracing payload APIs to instrument the [calling service](#calling-service) and the [called service](#called-service). The calling service uses an API call to generate a payload, which is accepted by the called service.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="calling-service"
    title="Instrument the calling service"
  >
    To instrument the calling service:

    1. Ensure the [version of the APM agent](#compatibility-requirements) that monitors the calling service supports distributed tracing.
    2. Invoke the agent API call for generating a distributed trace payload: [C SDK](/docs/agents/c-sdk/instrumentation/enable-distributed-tracing-your-c-applications).

      <Callout variant="important">
         To maintain proper ordering of spans in a trace, ensure you **generate the payload in the context of the span that sends it**.
      </Callout>
    3. Add that payload to the call made to the destination service (for example, in a header).
    4. (Optional) Identify the call as an external call (see [GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/c-sdk/blob/master/GUIDE.md#distributed-tracing)).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="called-service"
    title="Instrument the called service"
  >
    To instrument the called service:

    1. Ensure the [version of the APM agent](#compatibility-requirements) that monitors the called service supports distributed tracing.
    2. If the New Relic agent on the called service does not identify a New Relic transaction, use the agent API to declare a transaction:

      <Collapser
        id="c-sdk-create"
        title="C SDK"
      >
      One way to tell that a transaction is not in progress: when `newrelic_create_distributed_trace_payload()` is called, a `NULL` pointer is returned. To solve this problem, follow the procedures to [create a transaction](/docs/agents/c-sdk/instrumentation/instrument-your-app-c-sdk) with the C SDK.
      </Collapser>
    3. Extract the payload from the call that you received (for example, in a header).
    4. Invoke the call for accepting the payload (see the [C SDK documentation](/docs/agents/c-sdk/instrumentation/enable-distributed-tracing-your-c-applications).
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Instrument transactions and HTTP requests [#guidelines]

For transactions that occur in multiple services, the distributed trace payload contains information that allows New Relic to stitch them together into a complete transaction trace. However, if New Relic-monitored services are not sending trace context to each other, it will result in incomplete trace details. For more information, see the documentation about [passing the distributed tracing API header](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/enable-distributed-tracing#agent-apis) and the [C SDK's distributed tracing documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/c-sdk/blob/master/GUIDE.md#distributed-tracing).
