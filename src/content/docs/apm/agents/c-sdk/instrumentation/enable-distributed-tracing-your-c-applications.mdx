Read on to learn how to enable and instrument [distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing) for the New Relic's C SDK.

## Enable distributed tracing [#enable]

To enable distributed tracing for a New Relic-monitored C application:

1. Create a default [`newrelic_app_config_t`](https://newrelic.github.io/c-sdk/structnewrelic__app__config__t.html) and set the `distributed_tracing.enabled` field to `true`.

   ```
   newrelic_app_config_t* config
       = newrelic_create_app_config(app_name, license_key);
   config->distributed_tracing.enabled = true;
   ```
2. Continue with the procedures to [instrument transactions and HTTP requests](#guidelines).

<Callout variant="important">
  [Span events](https://newrelic.github.io/c-sdk/structnewrelic__span__event__config__t.html#details) can be enabled/disabled separately from distributed tracing.
</Callout>

## Instrument transactions and HTTP requests [#guidelines]

For transactions that occur in multiple services, the distributed trace payload contains information that allows New Relic to stitch them together into a complete transaction trace. However, if New Relic-monitored services are not sending trace context to each other, it will result in incomplete trace details. For more information, see the documentation about [passing the distributed tracing API header](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/enable-distributed-tracing#agent-apis) and the [C SDK's distributed tracing documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/c-sdk/blob/master/GUIDE.md#distributed-tracing).

## Examine logs for trace details [#logs-context]

You can bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With [logs in context](/docs/logs/logs-context/c-sdk-configure-logs-context/), you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI.

1. From the **Transactions** page, click on a trace to go to the [**Trace details** page](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/transaction-traces-trace-details-page).
2. From the trace details page, click **See logs**.
3. To view details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message.

  With logs in context, you can examine log data directly within your trace details.

You can also see logs in context of your [infrastructure data](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/), such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One.
