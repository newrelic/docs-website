  title="EOL NOTICE"

  As of April 2022, we're discontinuing support for several capabilities, including the C SDK. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/q1-bulk-eol-announcement-fy23/181744).
</Callout>

Read on to learn how to enable and instrument [distributed tracing](/docs/apm/distributed-tracing/getting-started/introduction-distributed-tracing) for the New Relic's C SDK.

## Enable distributed tracing [#enable]

To enable distributed tracing for a New Relic-monitored C application:

1. Create a default [`newrelic_app_config_t`](https://newrelic.github.io/c-sdk/structnewrelic__app__config__t.html) and set the `distributed_tracing.enabled` field to `true`.

   ```
   newrelic_app_config_t* config
       = newrelic_create_app_config(app_name, license_key);
   config->distributed_tracing.enabled = true;
   ```
2. Continue with the procedures to [instrument transactions and HTTP requests](#guidelines).

<Callout variant="important">
  [Span events](https://newrelic.github.io/c-sdk/structnewrelic__span__event__config__t.html#details) can be enabled/disabled separately from distributed tracing.
</Callout>

## Instrument transactions and HTTP requests [#guidelines]

For transactions that occur in multiple services, the distributed trace payload contains information that allows New Relic to stitch them together into a complete transaction trace. However, if New Relic-monitored services are not sending trace context to each other, it will result in incomplete trace details. For more information, see the documentation about [passing the distributed tracing API header](/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/enable-configure/enable-distributed-tracing#agent-apis) and the [C SDK's distributed tracing documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/newrelic/c-sdk/blob/master/GUIDE.md#distributed-tracing).

## Examine logs for trace details [#logs-context]

You can bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With [logs in context](/docs/logs/logs-context/c-sdk-configure-logs-context/), you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI.

1. From the **Transactions** page, click on a trace to go to the [**Trace details** page](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/transaction-traces-trace-details-page).
2. From the trace details page, click **See logs**.
3. To view details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message.



You can also see logs in context of your [infrastructure data](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/), such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page.
