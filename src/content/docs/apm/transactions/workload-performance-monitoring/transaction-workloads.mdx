When application performance issues arise, it's crucial to have a systematic approach to identify and resolve the root cause. This guide walks you to view application performance issues using Transaction 360.

Since Transaction 360 automatically captures and correlates all entities and data related to a specific problem or question, it provides a comprehensive view of the workload. This view includes the transaction flow, service relationships, and performance metrics, enabling you to quickly identify and resolve issues.

## Navigate to the Transaction 360 view

To access the Transaction Workloads view, follow these steps:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)> APM and Services**.
2. From the APM summary page, click **Transactions > Transaction Details > View transaction 360 workload**.

<Callout variant="important">
The Database and Serverless monitoring sections are currently available in staging environments. To access these features, ensure you have the appropriate account permissions and that your applications are properly instrumented for database and serverless monitoring.
</Callout>



The Transaction 360 view provides a detailed breakdown of the transaction workload, including the following components:

* **Transaction 360 Overview**: Displays the transaction workload summary, including the number of entities involved, alerts, and change tracking.

* **Dynamic flow map**: Visualizes the transaction flow, showing the services involved and the time taken by each service.

* **Participating entities**: Lists the services involved in the transaction workload, along with their performance metrics, including APM services, infrastructure entities, browser applications, mobile applications, database entities, serverless functions, and AI models.

The database entities section displays three main components:

1. **Throughput chart**: Visualizes database operations per minute over time
2. **Query time chart**: Shows database query response times and performance trends  
3. **Database tables**: Two switchable table views for detailed analysis

#### Database performance charts

The database section provides visual representations of key performance metrics:

- **Throughput chart**: Displays the volume of database operations over time, helping you identify traffic patterns and peak usage periods
- **Query time chart**: Shows query response times, enabling you to spot performance degradation and identify optimization opportunities

#### Database tables and drill-down capabilities

The database section includes two table views that you can switch between:

**Query table:**
- **Database name**: The specific database being queried
- **Call count**: Number of times each query was executed
- **Transaction count**: Number of transactions that used this query
- **Operation duration**: Time taken to execute the query
- **Max time**: Maximum execution time recorded for the query
- **Mean time**: Average execution time across all query executions
- **Total time**: Cumulative time spent executing the query

**Transaction table:**
- **Transaction name**: The specific transaction calling the database
- **Service name**: The service making the database calls
