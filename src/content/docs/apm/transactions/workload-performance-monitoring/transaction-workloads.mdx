Transaction 360 automatically captures and correlates all entities and data related to a specific transaction, providing a comprehensive view of your distributed workload. This holistic approach includes transaction flows, service relationships, and performance metrics across your entire stack, enabling you to quickly identify and resolve issues.

## What Transaction 360 shows you

Transaction 360 provides three main views to help you understand your workload:

- **Overview dashboard**: High-level summary with entity counts, issues, and change tracking
- **Dynamic flow map**: Visual representation of transaction paths and service dependencies  
- **Entity breakdown**: Detailed performance metrics for all participating components

## Access Transaction 360

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > APM and Services**
2. Select your service from the APM summary page
3. Go to **Transactions > Transaction Details > View transaction 360 workload**

<Callout variant="important">
Database and Serverless monitoring sections are currently available in staging environments. Ensure you have appropriate account permissions and proper instrumentation to access these features.

The flow map visualizes your transaction's journey through your distributed system:

- **Service connections**: See how services communicate and dependencies between them
- **Performance bottlenecks**: Identify slow components affecting overall transaction time
- **Trace relationships**: Click service pairs to view detailed tracing metrics between them

### Collaboration features
- **Team assignment**: Assign teams to transaction workloads for faster incident response
- **Tagging**: Group related entities to streamline investigation and organization

## Entity performance breakdown

This section provides detailed metrics for each type of component in your transaction workload:

### APM services

Monitor your application services with:

**Service metrics table:**
- **Throughput**: Requests per minute for each service
- **Error rate**: Percentage of failed requests  
- **Response time**: Average latency per service
- **Issue severity**: Critical, warning, and info alerts to prioritize fixes

**Transaction analysis:**
- **Performance changes**: Transactions with the highest response time changes
- **Trace details**: Click any transaction to view its complete trace flow

### Infrastructure entities

**Query analysis table:**
- **Database operations**: Call counts, duration, and timing metrics per query
- **Performance ranking**: Max, mean, and total execution times
- **Query optimization**: Identify slowest and most frequent queries

**Transaction impact table:**
- **Database dependency**: Shows which transactions rely most heavily on database operations
- **Time allocation**: Percentage of transaction time spent on database calls
- **Optimization targets**: Transactions with highest database overhead

**Interactive drill-down:**
- Click query counts to see all queries used by a specific transaction
- Click transaction names to filter queries by that transaction
- Access stack traces through individual query details

### Serverless functions

Monitor AWS Lambda and other serverless components:

**Customizable performance charts:**
- **Invocation patterns**: Function execution frequency over time
- **Duration metrics**: Execution times and performance trends
- **Memory utilization**: Resource consumption patterns
- **Cost tracking**: Associated expenses for function invocations

**Function analysis:**
- **Transaction relationships**: See which transactions trigger serverless functions
- **Performance impact**: How function performance affects overall transaction speed
- **Resource efficiency**: Memory allocation vs. actual usage

### Mobile applications

Track mobile app performance within your transaction flow:

- **App performance**: Response times and user experience metrics
- **Crash rates**: Mobile-specific error tracking
- **Device metrics**: Performance across different mobile devices

### AI/LLM monitoring

Monitor Large Language Model performance and costs:

- **Model performance**: Response times and accuracy metrics for AI services
- **Cost tracking**: Token usage and associated costs
- **Error rates**: Failed AI requests and timeout issues

For detailed AI monitoring setup, see [AI monitoring documentation](/docs/ai-monitoring/intro-to-ai-monitoring/).

## Next steps

After identifying issues in Transaction 360:

1. **Prioritize fixes**: Start with critical alerts and highest-impact performance problems
2. **Instrument gaps**: Add monitoring to uninstrumented entities for complete visibility
3. **Set up proactive monitoring**: Create alerts for key transaction performance thresholds
4. **Collaborate**: Use team assignments and tags to coordinate resolution efforts

Transaction 360 provides the comprehensive view you need to quickly understand, diagnose, and resolve issues across your entire distributed workload.
