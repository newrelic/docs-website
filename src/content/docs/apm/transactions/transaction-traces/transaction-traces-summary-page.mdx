In [APM](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/welcome-new-relic-apm), the transaction trace **Summary** page shows a summary of the data from a specific [transaction trace](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/transaction-traces). This document describes the main sections and functions you can use.

## Transaction trace Summary page [#summary]

To view transaction trace data, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions > (select a transaction trace)**. The transaction trace's **Summary** page has four main areas:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={150}>
        **Section**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Description**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Primary trace data, functions
      </td>

      <td>
        At the top of all transaction trace pages are some primary measurements and functions. Measurements include response time, trace time, and, if available, CPU info. Sometimes there also may be a note that it is a [partial trace](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/transaction-trace-details#partial).

        Available functions include:

        * Delete this trace: When you delete a trace, it cannot be retrieved.
        * Track as [key transaction](/docs/apm/transactions/key-transactions/key-transactions-tracking-important-transactions-or-events).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Chart
      </td>

      <td>
        This chart shows the trace segments that took the longest time, ordered by percentage of time spent. The remaining trace segments are grouped as **Remainder**.

        To show additional display options, mouse over the chart.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Slowest components
      </td>

      <td>
        The **Slowest components** table shows the number of calls, total duration, and percentage for each of the slowest components.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Transaction attributes
      </td>

      <td>
        This section displays available transaction attributes, including default attributes (such as referring URL and request headers) and [custom attributes](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/collect-custom-attributes). The exact request attributes collected by default depend on the [New Relic language agent](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/agent-attributes) you use.

        To turn attribute collection on or off for traces, you can either use the agent config file or the UI **Settings > Application** page (if your New Relic agent allows server-side configuration).
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The other main transaction trace UI page is the [Trace details page](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/transaction-trace-details).

## View logs for your APM and infrastructure data [#logs-context]

You can also bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With [logs in context](/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-apm-agents/), you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI. You can also see logs in context of your [infrastructure data](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/), such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page.
