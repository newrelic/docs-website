APM [transaction traces](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/transaction-traces) collect detailed data about your application's [transactions](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#transaction). Because they collect detailed data from your app, transaction traces can be a potential security concern. This document explains how to configure transaction traces for your data security needs.

## Database queries [#database]

The database query types collected by transaction traces vary by New Relic language agent. Query collection is a potential security and/or privacy concern because queries can contain sensitive values.

You can customize database query collection with three different security settings:

* **Obfuscated**: This is the default value. This setting strips string literals and numeric sequences from your queries and replaces them with the `?` character. For example: the query `select * from table where ssn='123-45-6789'` would become `select * from table where ssn=?`.
* **Off**: Query collection is turned off entirely.
* **Raw**: If you are confident that full query data collection will not impact your data security or your users' privacy, you can change the setting to `Raw`, which will record all query values.

You can edit database query collection with the `Record SQL` setting, explained in [Configure transaction traces](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/configure-transaction-traces).

## HTTP request attributes and parameters [#http-params]

The collection of HTTP request data can expose potentially sensitive data. New Relic calls the key/value data collected during an HTTP request **attributes**. By default, the collection of attributes is limited to only basic HTTP information that is not a source of sensitive data (for example, response code and host); these are part of the group of basic attributes that New Relic refers to as [**agent attributes**](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/agent-attributes).

For data security reasons, the collection of other attributes, including user-specific parameters, is disabled by default. For information on how to enable/disable the collection of specific HTTP attributes and custom attributes, see [Configure transaction traces](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/configure-transaction-traces#config-attributes).

## High security mode [#high-security]

New Relic's default settings provide a high level of security. To force the most secure settings for all the applications in your account, you can use the **high security mode**. This mode ensures that, no matter how your admins and users configure your account, the most secure settings are forced and cannot be overridden. For more information, see [High security mode](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/configuration/high-security-mode).
