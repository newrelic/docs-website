## Problem

You do not see transaction traces in the APM UI.

## Solution

If you are not seeing a [transaction trace](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/transaction-traces) in [APM](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/welcome-new-relic-apm), there are several possible reasons.

    title="Transaction tracing was disabled."
  >
    Transaction traces are enabled by default, but the setting may have been manually disabled. To solve this problem, change the setting back to enable transaction trace settings.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="criteria"
    title="The transaction does not meet criteria for tracing."
  >
    The transaction is not meeting the [criteria for being traced](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/transaction-traces#basics). For example:

    * It is responding more quickly than the 4-times-Apdex threshold or a custom number-of-seconds threshold.
    * It is not being selected as the slowest trace during the minute-long harvest cycle.

    If you don't see the transaction listed on the APM [Transactions page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/transactions-page), your APM agent is not capturing the activity as a transaction. In this situation, you must set up [custom instrumentation](/docs/apm/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/custom-instrumentation/) to monitor the activity as a transaction.

    id="brackets"
    title="The custom transaction name includes brackets."

    If you used [custom instrumentation](/docs/apm/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/custom-instrumentation/) to manually create a transaction, make sure you follow New Relic's naming rules.

    <Callout variant="important">
      Do not use brackets `[suffix]` at the end of your transaction name. New Relic automatically strips brackets from the name. Instead, use parentheses `(suffix)` or other symbols if needed.
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="no-traces"
    title="No traces appear for any transactions."
  >
    Change the **Threshold** value temporarily to `0.0001` so that transactions will definitely exceed the threshold. Be sure to return this to your original setting after you start receiving transaction traces.
