In [APM](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm), a <DNT>**transaction trace**</DNT> gives a detailed snapshot of a single [transaction](/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/transactions-new-relic-apm) in your application. A transaction trace records the available function calls, database calls, and external calls. You can use transaction traces to troubleshoot performance issues and to get detailed low-level insight into how your app is working.

## What transactions record traces [#basics]

In APM, a transaction trace records the segments that make up a [transaction](/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/transactions-new-relic-apm). Because they give you more detail, you can use transaction traces to analyze and [troubleshoot performance issues](#troubleshoot-example).

Here are the default rules that govern which transactions a New Relic agent traces:

* Over the minute-long [harvest cycle](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary/#harvest-cycle), all transactions that breach the threshold (either four times your [Apdex T value](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction) or a specific number of seconds) are added to a pool of transactions.
* At the end of that minute, the New Relic agent selects the slowest transaction in that pool and performs a transaction trace on it.

These are the general rules, but there are some agent-specific differences. For example:

* The Java agent collects occasional non-slow transactions.
* If one transaction is frequently traced, some agents will select other transactions to give a more diverse sampling.

If you [don't see traces in your account](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/troubleshooting-not-seeing-transaction-traces), it's possible that no transactions meet the necessary criteria. In this situation, you can adjust [transaction trace settings](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/configure-transaction-traces) to ensure some transactions will be traced.

If you use [synthetic monitoring](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/getting-started/new-relic-synthetics), you will likely have [synthetic monitor traces](/docs/synthetics/new-relic-synthetics/using-monitors/collect-synthetic-transaction-traces). Synthetic traces can happen more frequently than APM traces, potentially several per minute.

Additionally, when your application has [distributed tracing](/docs/distributed-tracing/concepts/introduction-distributed-tracing) enabled, we will display transactions derived from distributed trace data. When viewing one of these transactions derived from a distributed trace, we display only the in-process spans that demonstrate the transaction in your service. To view the entire distributed trace across services, click "View distributed trace".

## Configure transaction traces [#configure]

To configure or edit trace settings, see the procedures for:

* [Transaction traces](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/configure-transaction-traces)
* [Key transaction traces](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/configure-transaction-traces#key-txns)
* [Distributed tracing](/docs/distributed-tracing/concepts/quick-start)

## View transaction traces in UI [#find-view]

To view transaction traces:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & Services**</DNT>. Select an app, then under the <DNT>**Monitor**</DNT> section, click <DNT>**Transactions**</DNT>.
2. In the <DNT>**Transaction traces**</DNT> section, click a transaction trace to view [additional details](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/transaction-traces-summary-page).

## Examine logs for trace details [#logs-context]

You can bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With [logs in context](/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-apm-agents/), you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI.

1. From the <DNT>**Transactions**</DNT> page, click on a trace to go to the [<DNT>**Trace details**</DNT> page](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/transaction-traces-trace-details-page).
2. From the trace details page, click <DNT>**See logs**</DNT>.
3. To view details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message.

You can also see logs in context of your [infrastructure data](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/), such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page.

## Troubleshoot an issue with transaction traces [#troubleshoot-example]

If you expect to see transaction traces but do not see them, follow the [troubleshooting procedures](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/troubleshooting-not-seeing-transaction-traces).

For more information about using transaction traces, slow queries, and service maps to solve performance issues, see [Analyze performance issues](/docs/apm/applications-menu/features/analyze-database-instance-level-performance-issues).
