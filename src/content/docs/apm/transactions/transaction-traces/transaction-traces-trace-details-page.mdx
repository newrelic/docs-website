In [APM](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/welcome-new-relic-apm), the **Trace details** tab shows the timing of individual segments in a [transaction trace](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/transaction-traces). This document describes the sections and features of the **Trace details** tab.

The **Trace details** page displays a table and waterfall with the timing data for the segments in a transaction, plus additional features and functions.
Additional tabs are available to view all segment attributes and database queries recorded during the trace.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        **Trace details page**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Description**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Primary trace data, functions
      </td>

      <td>
        The top of each transaction trace UI page shows several primary pieces of data, including the trace time, response time, and, if available, CPU info. Also, sometimes the UI may indicate a [partial trace](#partial).
        When the trace is derived from Distribtued tracing, it also contains a link to view the full distributed that includes this transaction trace.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Segment column
      </td>

      <td>
        The **Segment** column displays segment names and counts. Fast and repeat calls may be [automatically grouped together](#rollup). Sometimes you may see [**Application code**](#application-code) as the name of a segment or subsegment.

        Use the expand and collapse dropdown arrows to expand segments.

    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Segment icons
      </td>

      <td>
        [Icons](#icons) represent significant characteristics of the segments.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Duration column
      </td>

      <td>
        The duration of each segment and subsegment is shown as both the number of milliseconds and a percentage of the total transaction time. Especially slow segments are [color-coded](#colors).
      </td>
    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

## Segment icons [#icons]

Icons indicate significant characteristics of a segment:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        **Icon**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Description**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img title="icon-database" alt="icon-database" src={apmIconDb}/> Database queries
      </td>

      <td>
        The database <Icon name="fe-database"/>
        icon identifies a database call segment. Click on the segment to view the raw database query. Depending on your [transaction trace settings](/docs/features/configuring-transaction-traces), this query can either show as raw data or obfuscated data.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <img title="icon-stack-trace" alt="icon-stack-trace" src={apmIconStackTrace} width="35px" height="35px" /> Stack traces
      </td>

      <td>
        The stack trace icon <Icon name="nr-stack-trace"/>
        icon indicates that a stack trace is available for this segment.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        <img title="icon-latency" alt="icon-latency" src={apmIconLatency} width="35px" height="35px" /> Latency
      </td>

      <td>
        The latency <Icon name="nr-latency"/>
        icon indicates that this segment accounts for a significant portion of latency in the trace. See [latency color codes](#colors).
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Color coding of segment duration data [#colors]

The **Duration** column of the **Trace details** table is color-coded:

<img title="Alerts v3: alert icons" alt="icon-alerts-red.png" src={apmRedAlert}/> Red: More than 25% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment.

<img title="Alerts v3: alert icons" alt="icon-alerts-yellow.png" src={apmYellowAlert}/> Yellow: More than 5% of the total transaction time was spent in this segment.

Color-coded durations do not necessarily indicate a problem. Whether the timing is actually a problem depends on what you consider normal and acceptable for your application.

## Application code in traces [#application-code]

If a segment is listed as **Application code** in the table, it indicates that that section of code was not instrumented. You can use [custom instrumentation](/docs/apm/other-features/metrics/custom-instrumentation) to get more detail on that part of the code. Segments will often be listed as **Application code** for [partial traces](#partial).

## Partial traces [#partial]

For performance reasons, APM only captures the first 2,000 segments of a transaction trace (900 for Node.js). If a transaction trace exceeds that number of segments, the agent truncates the transaction trace and displays a message at the top of the **Details** page:

`This is a partial trace.`

The APM agents have differing rules for when to truncate segments.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "150px" }}>
        APM agent
      </th>

      <th>
        Truncate segment rules
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Go
      </td>

      <td>
        The segment duration must be greater than the [`TransactionTracer.SegmentThreshold`](/docs/agents/go-agent/configuration/go-agent-configuration#txn-tracer-segment-threshold) value set in your Go segment configuration.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Java, .NET, Ruby
      </td>

      <td>
        These agents truncate traces chronologically. For more information, see the transaction tracer documentation for [Java](/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file#h2-transaction-segments), [.NET](/docs/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration#transaction_tracer), or [Ruby](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/configuration/ruby-agent-configuration#transaction_tracer) as applicable.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Node.js
      </td>

      <td>
        The Node.js agent only captures the first 900 segments of a transaction trace. For more information, see [Node.js transaction tracer configuration](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration#tx_tracer_config).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        PHP
      </td>

      <td>
        Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see [PHP transaction tracer configuration](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/transaction-traces-trace-details-page/).
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Python
      </td>

      <td>
        Truncates based on segment duration; the slowest 2,000 segments are captured for the trace. For more information, see [Python transaction tracer configuration](/docs/agents/python-agent/configuration/python-agent-configuration#txn-tracer-settings).
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Segment grouping rules [#rollup]

Transaction traces that have a lot of segments can be hard to interpret. New Relic helps you by automatically grouping fast and/or repeated method calls into a single segment grouping.

For example, you might see a segment titled `7 fast method calls`. This means that, because of their fast completion, New Relic assumed these calls were unlikely to be a problem and grouped them together. You can expand that grouping to see the individual segments.

Rules underlying segment grouping include:

* **Fast calls:** When New Relic detects four or more consecutive segments with a duration of 7.5 ms or less, these are grouped into a single collapsed header.
* **Identical calls:** When New Relic detects four or more consecutive identical calls, this usually indicates an N+1 problem. These segments are collapsed. Expanding the collapsed node displays only the first three calls, not all calls.

## Distributed traces [#distributed-traces]

When a transaction trace is based on distributed trace data, you can view the full distributed trace by clicking on the distributed trace link in the page header.

The trace details page will display slightly different information when looking at a distributed trace instead of a transaction trace. 

* All attributes are grouped into a single `Attributes` section rather than being split out into the three default attribute types
* Segment metric names may differ slightly between distributed traces and transaction traces
* Stack traces are not displayed in segment attributes

## Examine logs for trace details [#logs-context]

You can bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With [logs in context](/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-apm-agents/), you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI.

1. From the **Transactions** page, click on a trace to go to the [**Trace details** page](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/transaction-traces-trace-details-page).
2. From the trace details page, click **See logs**.
3. To view details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message.

You can also see logs in context of your [infrastructure data](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/), such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page.
