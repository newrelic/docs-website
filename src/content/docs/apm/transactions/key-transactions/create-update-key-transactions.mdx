In APM, you can make a transaction a [key transaction](/docs/apm/transactions/key-transactions/key-transactions-tracking-important-transactions-or-events) when you want it to have a custom level of monitoring, or when you want it to have its own [alert policy](/docs/apm/transactions/key-transactions/view-key-transactions-alert-information).

For most New Relic agents, a key transaction can be any type of transaction. For the PHP, Node.js, and Go agents, only **web transactions** can be turned into key transactions.

## Create key transactions [#create]

To create a key transaction: 

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > All capabilities > Key transactions** to view the [key transactions index](/docs/apm/transactions/key-transactions/key-transactions-tracking-important-transactions-or-events#find).
2. Select **Add more**, then select an application and a transaction. 

## Rename a key transaction [#rename]

Here's how to rename:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > All capabilities > Key transactions**.
2. From the index, select the gear <Icon name="fe-settings"/> icon for the key transaction you want to rename.
3. Enter a new name for the transaction, then save.

## Change Apdex settings [#apdex]

You can set a custom [Apdex threshold](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction) for a key transaction if it is a [web transaction](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#transaction). (Apdex is not applicable for [non-web-transactions](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#non-web-transaction).) This is useful if the transaction is expected to be faster or slower than other transactions.

<Callout variant="important">
  Key transaction Apdex settings override the T value set for that app. This can mean, for example, that a key transaction could be reported as **Satisfied** but a different transaction in the same app with the same response time could be **Frustrated**.
</Callout>

To change a key transaction's Apdex threshold:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > All capabilities > Key transactions**.
2. Select the <Icon name="fe-settings"/>
   icon for the transaction you want to edit.
3. Enter a new value in seconds under the **Apdex T** heading, then save.

The Apdex threshold affects how [key transaction traces](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/configure-transaction-traces#key-txns) are created.

## Delete key transactions [#delete]

To delete a key transaction:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > All capabilities > Key transactions**.
2. Select the gear <Icon name="fe-settings"/>
   icon for the key transaction you want to delete.
3. Select **Stop tracking**.

New Relic automatically deletes any associated alerts and events for the deleted key transaction.
