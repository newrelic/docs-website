The **Background jobs analysis** report helps you analyze the performance of jobs and other [non-web transactions](/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/monitor-background-processes-other-non-web-transactions) running in production that use frameworks instrumented by New Relic, such as `DelayedJob` and `Resque`. The report shows comparison information from the past 24 hours back to the past 7 days, including the amount of time spent in throughput (requests per minute or **rpm**), total time spent in the job, and average time to execute it.

## View report in UI [#procedures]

To view the **Background jobs analysis** report for your app: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services > (select an app) > Reports > Performance > Non-web transactions** tab. The default report compares the last 24 hours with the previous 24-hour period, 7 days ago, and averages over the last 7 days.

APM's capacity analysis report shows how many instances of your app are running and how busy they are. This information is useful to analyze whether your app has enough instances deployed to support request loads. You can then use this information to fine-tune your configuration for optimal performance.

The capacity analysis report is only available for [Python](#agent-capacity-analysis) and Ruby language agents.

## View the capacity analysis report [#procedures]

To view the capacity analysis report for your app:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services > (select an app) > Reports > Capacity**.
2. Use any of New Relic's standard [page functions](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/standard-dashboard-features) to drill down into detailed information.

<img
  title="Capacity report.png"
  alt="Capacity analysis report"

    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        **Capacity chart**

    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        App instance busy
      </td>

      <td>
        This chart shows how busy are your application's instances as the percentage of time to process requests. This includes the average, minimum, and maximum percentages for any time period on the chart.

        Use this information to determine if you have the right number of instances for your application. As application utilization approaches 100%, your application needs more instances to handle incoming requests.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        App instance restarts by host
      </td>

      <td>
        This chart shows the number of instance restarts for each time interval. Use this information to determine if your application instances are restarting too frequently.

        To isolate activity to a specific host, select other hosts' titles on the legend below the chart to hide or return them to the chart.

        OR:

        Select your choice from the **Hosts** list on the APM [Summary](/docs/applications-menu/applications-overview) page.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        App instance analysis
      </td>

      <td>
        This chart shows the total number of instances running, along with the concurrent instance load. The concurrent instance load is the number of fully busy instances that would be needed to handle the load on the app. New Relic bases this on the average app instances value from the **App instance busy** chart, multiplied by the number of instances you have running.

## Python single or multi-threaded apps [#agent-capacity-analysis]

For the Python agent, capacity analysis reporting only works for traditional single or multi-threaded applications. This is because the way New Relic calculates a system load does not translate to co-routine based systems.

When using a traditional single or multi-threaded application, the metric information generated by the Python agent is captured and reported only if the optional C extension component can be compiled and installed. When you use co-routine based systems such as gevent or eventlet in conjunction with a WSGI server, the capacity analysis report will not show any data except for agent restarts.

APM's scalability analysis report shows response time, database time, and CPU time in relation to the application load. This helps you evaluate performance and identify potential hardware requirements as your app grows.

## View the Scalability analysis report [#procedures]

To view the report for your app:

Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services > (select an app) > Reports > Scalability**.

The Scalability analysis report includes three tabs: Response time, Database, and APM CPU. Each tab contains a billboard and a chart and represents a different aspect of performance.

<img
  title="Scalability analysis report.webp"
  alt="Scalability analysis report"
  src={apmScalabilityReport}
/>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        **Tab**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Description**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Response time
      </td>

      <td>
        The chart in this tab plots your application's response time, versus application load in terms of requests per minute. For an application that is scaling well, the response time should be at or close to horizontal. The billboard shows the average, minimum, and maximum response times, and average throughput.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Database
      </td>

      <td>
        The chart in this tab plots your application's database time versus application load in terms of requests per minute. For an application that is scaling well, you should see a roughly linear pattern in the plotted points. The billboard shows the average, minimum, and maximum database times, and average throughput.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        APM CPU
      </td>

      <td>
        The chart in this tab plots your application's CPU time per request, versus application load in terms of requests per minute. For an application that is scaling well, you should see a roughly linear pattern in the plotted points. The billboard shows the average, minimum, and maximum CPU times, and average throughput.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The charts feature two lines: the primary line, which connects the data points, and the secondary line, which is labeled as "Smoothed" and shows a smoothed version of the primary line. The secondary line helps visualize the application's performance without being concerned about unexpected fluctuations observed in the primary line.

These charts are constructed a bit differently from other New Relic charts and do not have the default chart actions commonly available.

## Select options for time periods [#time]

The Scalability report has a [time picker](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/manage-your-dashboard/#dash-time-picker) that allows you to view data over different time periods. The minimum recommended time period is 30 minutes because when analyzing an application’s scalability, lower time ranges don’t give a full picture. The time picker uses the default value of the last 30 minutes.

## View data for individual instances [#instances]

Each tab includes an instance picker which allows you to select a specific instance and the chart and the billboard will filter to the data of that instance.

APM's web transactions analysis report provides comparison information for web transactions, including the amount of time spent in throughput (requests per minute or **rpm**), total time in the web transaction, average time to execute it, and [Apdex](/docs/site/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction) score. You can compare the past 24 hours of data with the previous 24 hour period, 7 days ago, and averages over the last 7 days.

Use this information to analyze which web transactions consume the most time, have the most number of calls, have the greatest number of standard deviations, and more. This information can help you identify where to fine-tune your app.

## View the Web transactions analysis report [#procedures]

To view the web transactions analysis report for your app: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services > (select an app) > Reports > Performance > Web transactions** tab.

The default report compares the last 24 hours with the previous 24-hour period, 7 days ago, and averages over the last 7 days. Apdex entries followed by an asterisk (\*) indicate that more than one Apdex threshold was set for the given time period.

Every Monday, New Relic sends a weekly performance report via email to any of your account's users who have [selected to receive this report](/docs/subscriptions/account-email-settings). The email report contains summary performance metrics for the past week for a select group of your applications. The weekly performance report is different than APM's [Service Level Agreement (SLA) reports](/docs/apm/reports/service-level-agreements/apm-sla-reports).

<Callout variant="important">
  At this time, weekly performance reports are not available for accounts in the EU region.
</Callout>

## View example report details [#report_detais]

To see an example of a weekly performance report for your account:

1. From the [user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings), select **User preferences**.
2. Go down to **Weekly summary emails** and select **See a sample email**.

<img
