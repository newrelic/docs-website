APM's web transactions analysis report provides comparison information for web transactions, including the amount of time spent in throughput (requests per minute or **rpm**), total time in the web transaction, average time to execute it, and [Apdex](/docs/site/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction) score. You can compare the past 24 hours of data with the previous 24 hour period, 7 days ago, and averages over the last 7 days.

Use this information to analyze which web transactions consume the most time, have the most number of calls, have the greatest number of standard deviations, and more. This information can help you identify where to fine-tune your app.

## View the Web transactions analysis report

To view the web transactions analysis report for your app: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > APM > (select an app) > Reports > Web transactions**.

The default report compares the last 24 hours with the previous 24-hour period, 7 days ago, and averages over the last 7 days. Apdex entries followed by an asterisk (\*) indicate that more than one Apdex threshold was set for the given time period.
