metaDescription: For APM, you can receive a weekly performance summary report via email.
---

Every Monday, New Relic sends a weekly performance report via email to any of your account's users who have [selected to receive this report](/docs/subscriptions/account-email-settings). The email report contains summary performance metrics for the past week for a select group of your applications. The weekly performance report is different than APM's [Service Level Agreement (SLA) reports](/docs/apm/reports/service-level-agreements/apm-sla-reports).

<Callout variant="important">
  At this time, weekly performance reports are not available for accounts in the EU region.
</Callout>

## View example report details [#report_detais]

To see an example of a weekly performance report for your account:

1. From the [account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown), select **User preferences**.
2. Select **Weekly summaries** and select **See sample email**.

The performance report is split into sections:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        **Section**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Description**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Featured app
      </td>

      <td>
        This provides both [throughput pattern and performance metrics](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page#overview_charts) for the application with the highest call count in your account.

        Applications with linked browser monitoring will be prioritized over those that do not, even if the call count is lower.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        All apps report
      </td>

      <td>
        This section provides important performance metrics for the 20 applications in your account with the highest call count. Metrics in this list include uptime, [Apdex](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction), load time, and throughput.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Recent events
      </td>

      <td>
        This section contains any recent alerts, deployments you have made to your app, or other events that are recorded for applications in your account.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Selected applications [#featured_apps]

New Relic selects the top 20 apps by call count that meet these criteria:

* The app must have at least 25 requests per minute (rpm) throughput.
* The app must include web transactions.

Applications with linked browser monitoring will be prioritized over those that do not, even if the call count is lower.

## Opt in or out of report emails [#opting_out]

To manage your weekly performance report emails, go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), click the [account dropdown](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#account-dropdown), and select **User preferences**. Note that you opt in/out separately for every New Relic account you have access to.

## Analyze your data [#insights]

APM includes several reports in the user interface. To gather, analyze, and visualize data about your software in other formats, use [query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder).
