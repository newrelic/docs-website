The **Background jobs analysis** report helps you analyze the performance of jobs and other [non-web transactions](/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/monitor-background-processes-other-non-web-transactions) running in production that use frameworks instrumented by New Relic, such as `DelayedJob` and `Resque`. The report shows comparison information from the past 24 hours back to the past 7 days, including the amount of time spent in throughput (requests per minute or **rpm**), total time spent in the job, and average time to execute it.

To view the **Background jobs analysis** report for your app: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > APM > (select an app) > Reports > Background jobs**. The default report compares the last 24 hours with the previous 24-hour period, 7 days ago, and averages over the last 7 days.
