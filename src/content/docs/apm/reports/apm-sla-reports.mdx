APM provides service level agreement (SLA) reports. SLA reports help you better understand your application performance by showing application downtime and trends over time.

SLA reports for an application only include web transactions. If your application creates only non-web transactions, New Relic does not produce SLA reports for that app.

SLA reports can be viewed in APM or downloaded as comma-separated value (**.csv**) files. Depending on your account level's [data retention](/docs/subscriptions/data-retention) policy, you can view daily, weekly, or monthly reports.

<Callout variant="important">
  On top of the standard APM SLA reports described in this document, New Relic has developed an advanced [service level management](/docs/service-level-management/intro-slm) feature, with improved functionality.

## View SLA reports [#procedure]

To view the SLA reports for your app: Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services > (select an app) > Reports > SLA**. The report defaults to the **Application** tab. SLA report data shows the account owner's time zone, with periods beginning and ending at midnight in that time zone.

If you have not enabled [browser](/docs/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-process) for your app, the SLA report shows links to requests, response time, and [Apdex](/docs/site/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction) only for your application server.
