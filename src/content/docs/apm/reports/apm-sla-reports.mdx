APM provides service level agreement (SLA) reports. SLA reports help you better understand your application performance by showing application downtime and trends over time.

SLA reports can be viewed in APM or downloaded as comma-separated value (<DNT>**.csv**</DNT>) files. Depending on your account level's [data retention](/docs/subscriptions/data-retention) policy, you can view daily, weekly, or monthly reports.

<Callout variant="important">
  In addition to the APM SLA reports described here, we've got an advanced [service level management feature](/docs/service-level-management/intro-slm), which lets you define the most important performance metrics for your business and view results across workloads.

## View SLA reports [#procedure]

To view the SLA reports for your app: Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services > (select an app) > Reports > SLA**</DNT>. The report defaults to the <DNT>**Application**</DNT> tab. SLA report data shows the account owner's time zone, with periods beginning and ending at midnight in that time zone.

If you have not enabled [browser](/docs/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-process) for your app, the SLA report shows links to requests, response time, and [Apdex](/docs/site/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction) only for your application server. To learn how to define your SLA report metrics, read our [app performance reports](/docs/apm/reports/performance-reports) doc.
