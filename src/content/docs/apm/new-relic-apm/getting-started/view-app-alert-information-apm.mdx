Good <InlinePopover type="alerts"/> help notify individuals or teams about changes in their systems. [Alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/getting-started/new-relic-alerts) provides a single, coordinated alerting tool across New Relic products. This allows you to manage [alert policies](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/getting-started/alerts-glossary#alert-policy) and [conditions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/getting-started/alerts-glossary#alert-condition) that focus on the metrics for [entities](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/getting-started/alerts-glossary#alert-entity) (such as apps or key transactions in APM) that you care about the most.

After you [set up one or more alert policies](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/name-or-rename-alert-policy) and [define alert conditions](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/define-alert-conditions) for your New Relic [product entities (targets)](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/configuring-alert-policies/select-product-targets-alert-condition), you can view that information in the alerts UI. You can also view alert policy information in the UI for individual New Relic products.

## View policies and conditions from APM [#policy]

To view alert policy and condition information for a specific app or key transaction directly from APM:

1. Do one of the following:
   * App: Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > (select an app) > Settings > Alert conditions**</DNT>.
   * Key transaction: Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > More > Key transactions > (select a key transaction) > Settings > Alert conditions**</DNT>.
2. From the <DNT>**Alert conditions**</DNT> page, use the available tools to search, sort, view, or update the alert conditions and their associated policies.

## View events and activities from APM [#activity]

<Callout variant="tip">
  To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use our [entity explorer](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/new-relic-one-entity-explorer).
</Callout>

To view summary information about [events](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/getting-started/alerts-glossary#event) and other activity directly from APM:

1. Do one of the following:
   * App: Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**</DNT>.
   * Key transaction: Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > More > Key transactions**</DNT>.
2. From the index, mouse over the entity's [color-coded health status](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/getting-started/alerts-glossary#health-status), select a link from the <DNT>**Application activity**</DNT> list, or select a specific browser app or key transaction to view additional details.

For example, if a critical alert incident occurs:

* The health status indicator turns red on the APM index and on the selected app.
* The background color for various charts changes to pink.
* The <DNT>**Application activity**</DNT> list on the APM index and on the selected app's <DNT>**Summary**</DNT> page shows Warning (yellow) and Critical (red) incidents as applicable.

To learn more about the incident in alerts, mouse over or select any pink area on a chart. For more information and examples, see [View events from their products](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-events/view-events-their-products).

## View alert incidents from APM [#incidents]

If an alert condition has [thresholds](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/getting-started/alerts-glossary#alert-threshold) set up for Warning (yellow) or Critical (red) incidents, the color-coded [health status](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/getting-started/alerts-glossary#health-status) for an entity will change to indicate an incident. You can view the incidents directly from the page for the app or key transaction in APM:

1. Do one of the following:

   * App: Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Alerts  > (select an app) > Issues & Activity**</DNT> and click the <DNT>**Incidents**</DNT> tab.
   * Key transaction: Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Key Transactions > (select a key transaction) > Issues & Activity**</DNT> and click the <DNT>**Incidents**</DNT> tab.

2. From the <DNT>**Incidents**</DNT> index, use the available tools to search, sort, or view incidents for the selected app or key transaction.

3. Optional: To view or update the alert policies, conditions, or thresholds that triggered the incidents, select the corresponding link.

<Callout variant="tip">
  You can also view Warning and Critical incidents from the alerts UI for [specific incidents](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-alert-incidents/explore-incident-history) or for [incidents and events across all products](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/reviewing-events/review-events-across-products). Alerts sends [alert notifications](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts-beta/managing-notification-channels/notification-channels-controlling-where-send-alerts) only for Critical (red) incidents.
