## Problem

When other monitoring software is running alongside one of our APM agents, we cannot guarantee that our agents will work correctly. In some cases, running more than one type of instrumentation, APM, or monitoring software can cause issues such as unreliable metrics and agent crashes.

For specifics, see the requirements and compatibility documentation for a specific APM agent.

## Solution

If you think that running other monitoring software might be causing an issue, here are some recommendations:

* Read the requirements and compatibility documentation for the APM agent you're using.
* To troubleshoot if this is causing an issue, temporarily disable or uninstall other APM software to see if the issue is still present.
