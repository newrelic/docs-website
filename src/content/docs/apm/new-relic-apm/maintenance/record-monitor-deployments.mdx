Deploying an app can be a risky event—when your app breaks, a bad deployment is often the cause. New Relic allows you to track deployments so you can correlate deploy to your app's performance. Tracking deployments creates deployment markers that appear in APM charts.

See how deployment markers work in this short video (4:30 minutes):
<Video id="HPeXZubcZ7o" type="youtube" />

## Options for tracking deployments [#options]

You can use the New Relic [REST API v2](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/new-relic-rest-api-v2-getting-started) to record new deployments, retrieve a list of past deployments, and delete past deployments on your APM application. In addition, some APM agents have agent-specific methods to record deployments automatically.

You can use your [Slack](https://slack.com/) integration with New Relic, or a simple webhook, to notify your team in real time of deployments for applications monitored by APM. Slack provides a webhook URL that allows you to post generic JSON that will appear formatted in a chosen Slack channel.

There are a few places where you can view deployments in the New Relic UI after they have been recorded. You can **view** deployments in the UI:

* In the activity feed of the [APM Summary](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page-view-transaction-apdex-usage-data), New Relic One **Service** summary, and [entity summary](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/new-relic-one-entity-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts) pages.
* On APM performance charts as a chart marker.
* On the [**Deployments** page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/events/deployments-page-view-impact-your-app-users) for summary performance.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Deployment markers are not available for browser applications, but see [browser releases](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/add-release) for a way to tag errors with release versions.
</Callout>

## Record deployments with the REST API [#api-instructions]

You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record deployments, get a list of past deployments, and delete deployments.

* The examples in this document use `curl` as a command line tool. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. You can also create, view, and delete deployments with the [API Explorer](https://rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/application_deployments/create).
* JSON uses double quotes `"` for element names and content. Using single quotes `'` will cause errors.

    title="Record a deployment with POST"
  >
    To record a new deployment, send a `POST` request that includes your [API key](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-rest-api-v2#api_key) to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see [Character limits and JSON parameters](#deployment_limits)). All payload parameters are optional except `revision`.

    For example:

    ```
    curl -X POST "https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/<var><a href="/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/finding-product-id#apm">$APP_ID</a></var>/deployments.json" \
         -H "Api-Key:<a href="/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-rest-api-v2#api_key"><var>$API_KEY</var></a>" \
         -i \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d \
    '{
      "deployment": {
        "revision": "<var>REVISION</var>",
        "changelog": "<var>Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None</var>",
        "description": "<var>Added a deployments resource to the v2 API</var>",
        "user": "<var>datanerd@example.com</var>",
        "timestamp": "<var>2019-10-08T00:15:36Z</var>"

    To record a deployment with PowerShell, send a `POST` request that includes your [API key](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-rest-api-v2#api_key) to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see [Character limits and JSON parameters](#deployment_limits)). All payload parameters are optional except `revision`.

    This example uses PowerShell version 3 or higher:

    ```
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/<var><a href="/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/finding-product-id#apm">YOUR_APP_ID</a></var>/deployments.json -Method POST -Headers @{'Api-Key'='<a href="/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-rest-api-v2#api_key"><var>$API_KEY</var></a>'} -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{
        "deployment": {
        "revision": "<var>REVISION</var>",
        "changelog": "<var>Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None</var>",
        "description": "<var>Added a deployments resource to the v2 API</var>",
        "user": "<var>datanerd@example.com</var>",
        "timestamp": "<var>2019-10-08T00:15:36Z</var>"
    }
    }'
    ```

    This example uses PowerShell version 2 (requires .NET framework 3.5 or higher):

    ```
    $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding("ASCII")
    $data ='{
    "deployment": {
        "revision": "<var>REVISION</var>",
        "changelog": "<var>Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None</var>",
        "description": "<var>Added a deployments resource to the v2 API</var>",

    $postData = $encoding.GetBytes($data)
    $request = [System.Net.WebRequest]::Create('https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/<var><a href="/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/finding-product-id#apm">$APP_ID</a></var>/deployments.json')
    $request.Method = 'POST'

    To retrieve a list of all past deployments for your app, send a `GET` request that includes your [API key](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-rest-api-v2#api_key) to the deployments endpoint. GET requests do not use a JSON payload.

    For example:

    ```
    curl -X GET "https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/<var><a href="/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/finding-product-id#apm">$APP_ID</a></var>/deployments.json" \

## Record deployments using the New Relic agent [#agent]

Some agents have additional methods to record deployments:

* **All agents**: Use the New Relic [REST API v2](#api).
* **C**: No SDK-specific methods. Use the [REST API](#api).
* **Go**: No agent-specific methods. Use the [REST API](#api).
* **Java**: Call the [Java agent `jar`](/docs/agents/java-agent/instrumentation/recording-deployments-java-agent).
* **.NET**: Use [PowerShell and the REST API](#powershell).
* **Node.js**: No agent-specific methods. Use the [REST API](#api).
* **PHP**: Use a [PHP script](/docs/agents/php-agent/features/recording-deployments-using-php-script).
* **Python**: Use the [`record-deploy`](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-admin-script#record-deploy) subcommand of the `newrelic-admin` script.
* **Ruby**: Use a [Capistrano recipe](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/features/recording-deployments-ruby-agent#capistrano3).

## Notify your team of deployments [#webhooks]

After a deployment is recorded using the REST API, you can optionally notify a webhook endpoint of the deployment.

The destination of the webhook can be your Slack instance. To use webhooks to set up a deployment notification for a Slack channel:

1. Log in to your Slack account as an admin, then go to **App directory > Manage > Apps**.
2. Search for your New Relic app, then select **Add configuration**.
3. From **Post to channel**, select an existing Slack channel or add a new channel, then **Add configuration**.
4. From the list of options, copy the webhook URL.
5. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > ([account dropdown](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#account-dropdown)) > Account settings > Integrations > Deploy notifications > Webhook**.
6. Paste the Slack webhook URL, then save.
7. Optional: Send a test message.

<Callout variant="tip">
  You can also use webhooks, Slack channels, and other options for [alert notifications with New Relic Alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/managing-notification-channels/notification-channels-control-where-send-alerts).
</Callout>

## End of life notification: Campfire [#eol]

As of September 9, 2019, integrations with Campfire for APM deployment notifications are no longer available. **Recommendation:** If you are still using Campfire, use [webhooks with Slack channels](#webhooks) instead. For more information, see the New Relic [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/end-of-life-for-campfire-and-hipchat-deployment-notifications/79927).
