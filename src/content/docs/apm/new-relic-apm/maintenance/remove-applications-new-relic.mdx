Applications are automatically removed from New Relic after 93 days without sending data to our platform. Key metrics will continue to be available via the [New Relic REST API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-rest-api-v2), with the application name remaining reserved.

For more information, see [Inactive apps in New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/new-relic-feature-end-life-announcements-july-2020#inactive-apps) and our [data retention guidelines](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts/data-management/overview-data-retention-components#apm).

## Before attempting to remove an app [#requirements]

Before attempting to remove an APM, browser, or mobile app from the New Relic UI, keep in mind:

* You can [downgrade your account](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/downgradecancel-account) to pay less or make it entirely free.
* To remove an app, you must have a [user role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-users/users-roles) with that capability.
* If an agent is still sending data from an app, you cannot remove an app.

## Remove an application from New Relic [#remove]

Before removing an APM, browser, or mobile application from New Relic, stop the application from sending data either by disabling the agent or by [uninstalling it completely](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/uninstall-agent).

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id=""
    title="APM applications"
  >
    1. Disable the APM agent:
       * [**C SDK**](/docs/agents/c-sdk/install-configure/uninstall-remove-c-sdk#disable): Do a quick recompile and deploy. For example, surround your instrumentation in `#ifdef`, and set the value of `YOURNAMESPACE_NEWRELIC_ENABLED` with your build system.
       * [**Go**](/docs/agents/go-agent/instrumentation/go-agent-configuration#enabled): Set `Enabled` to `false`.
       * [**Java**](/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file#cfg-agent_enabled): Set `agent_enabled` to `false`.
       * [**.NET**](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/net-agent-configuration#app-cfg-agent-enabled): Set `Newrelic.AgentEnabled` to `false`.
       * [**Node.js**](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration#enabled): Set `agent_enabled` to `false`.
       * [**PHP**](/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration#inivar-enabled): Remove or disable both the **newrelic.so** and [**newrelic-daemon**](/docs/agents/php-agent/getting-started/new-relic-daemon-processes) components. Set `newrelic.enabled` to `false`.
       * [**Python**](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-configuration#monitor_mode): Set `monitor_mode` to `false`.
       * [**Ruby**](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/installation-configuration/ruby-agent-configuration#agent_enabled): Set `agent_enabled` to `false`.
    2. [Restart the application server](https://github.com/newrelic/go-agent/blob/master/GUIDE.md#config-and-application) and wait up to ten minutes. Verify the color-coded [health status](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#health-status) for the app has turned to gray and is no longer reporting data.
    3. To remove the APM application and its browser applications, call the [`/applications/delete`](https://rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/applications/delete) endpoint of the New Relic REST API. For example:

       ```
       curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/<a href="/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/application-examples-v2/list-your-app-id-metric-timeslice-data-v2"><var>YOUR_APP_ID</var></a>.json' \
            -H 'X-Api-Key:<a href="/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/types-new-relic-api-keys#personal-api-key"><var>YOUR_API_KEY</var></a>' -i
       ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id=""
    title="Browser"
  >
    * If you've used the [copy/paste method to install the browser agent](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation/install-new-relic-browser-agent#copy-paste-app), remove the JavaScript snippet from your application's pages. After 93 days, the application will be removed from New Relic.

      <Callout variant="tip">
        If browser data continues to be reported, see our [suggestions](#browser-reporting) below.
      </Callout>
    * If your browser application is linked to an APM application, deleting the APM application also removes the browser application. Call the [`/applications/delete`](https://rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/applications/delete) endpoint like this:

      ```
      curl -X DELETE 'https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/<a href="/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/application-examples-v2/list-your-app-id-metric-timeslice-data-v2"><var>YOUR_APP_ID</var></a>.json' \
           -H 'X-<span id="cke_bm_38757C" style="display: none;"> </span>Api-Key:<a href="/docs/apis/get-started/intro-apis/types-new-relic-api-keys#personal-api-key"><var>YOUR_API_KEY</var></a>' -i
      ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id=""
    title="Mobile"
  >
    Remove all references/dependencies to the New Relic's mobile SDK/frameworks, then rebuild the application. For more information, see the [iOS](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/installation) and [Android](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/install-configure) install docs.

    After 93 days, the application will be removed from New Relic.

## Troubleshooting

If you have problems removing an app, here are some possible causes and suggested solutions:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="not-owner-admin"
    title="You are not an admin on your full user account"
  >
    If you don't have proper permissions, you won't be able to remove an application.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="wait-longer"
    title="You have not waited long enough"
  >
    All app data must stop reporting to New Relic before you can remove that entity from New Relic. In most cases, this takes between 10-15 minutes. In rare cases, it can take a few minutes longer.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="agents-not-disabled"
    title="Not all agents are disabled"
  >
    If you have multiple agents reporting data under the same UI name, then you must make sure you disable or uninstall **all** of the agents associated with that entity.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="php-issues"
    title="You have problems removing your PHP app"
  >
    If you have a PHP app and aren't able to remove it from the UI, possible causes include:

    * You have not disabled both components of the PHP agent. You must stop or uninstall both `newrelic.so` and `newrelic-daemon` in order to be able to remove a PHP app. For more information, see [New Relic daemon processes](/docs/agents/php-agent/getting-started/new-relic-daemon-processes).
    * You have set up per-directory monitoring of your PHP app, and unexpected PHP data is reporting as the default PHP application in the New Relic UI. To fix this, change the [default app name in the PHP agent config](/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration#inivar-appname).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="name-confusion"
    title="You don't know where the app's data is coming from"
  >
    If you don't know where an app's data is coming from, it may be because the [app's name has been changed](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/rename-your-application). When an app name is changed in the UI, it does not change the underlying app name being reported; it only changes how the app name appears in the UI.

    To see if there is a difference between the reported name and the displayed name:

    1. From [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com), select **APM**, then select an application.
    2. Scroll down to **Settings** and select **Application.**
    3. Compare the name in the **Application alias** field to the name in the **Your application still reports as** message directly beneath it.

    To get host information about an app you are not familiar with:

    1. From [**one.newrelic.com**](http://one.newrelic.com), select **APM**, then select an application.
    2. From the summary view, review the **Servers** list.

    Once you have identified where app data is coming from, you can remove the app from New Relic.

  <Collapser
    id="browser-reporting"
    title="Browser data is still reporting"
  >
    To remove an app from New Relic, all data must have stopped reporting, including browser monitoring data. To verify that you have disabled or uninstalled the APM agent associated with the app:

    1. Ensure that [browser monitoring is disabled](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation-configuration/browser-settings-ui-options-browser-monitoring#disabling).
       * If your browser monitoring script is inserted by the APM agent, turn it off from inside the UI, in the agent's config file, or in both.
       * If you copied and pasted the monitoring JavaScript snippet in certain pages, remove that JavaScript snippet manually.
    2. Ensure all caches have been cleared that the application uses, such as host caches, CDNs, or anything else that caches built pages.
    3. Optional: To see a count of how many page views report from each domain, use this [NRQL query](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql):

       ```
       SELECT count(*) FROM PageView WHERE appName = <var>'YOUR_BROWSER_APP_NAME'</var> FACET domain
       ```

    If these steps don't resolve the issue, it is likely due to an end-user's browser cache that hasn't yet cleared. Wait until those caches clear. If your app has internal users, you may be able to identify the users and clear those caches.
