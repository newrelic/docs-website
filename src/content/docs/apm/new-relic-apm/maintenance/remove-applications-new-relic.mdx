Applications are automatically removed from New Relic after 93 days without sending data to our platform. You can also remove an application using the UI, once it has stopped sending data. Key metrics will continue to be available via the [New Relic REST API](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-rest-api-v2), with the application name remaining reserved.

For more information, see our [data retention guidelines](/docs/accounts/accounts/data-management/overview-data-retention-components#apm).

## Before attempting to remove an app [#requirements]

Before attempting to remove an app monitored by New Relic <InlinePopover type="apm"/>, <InlinePopover type="browser"/>, or <InlinePopover type="mobile"/> from the UI, keep in mind:

* You can [downgrade your New Relic organization](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-setup/downgradecancel-account) to pay less or make it entirely free.
* The ability to remove an app from the UI may be dependent on [permissions](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/factors-affecting-access-features-data/#user-permissions).
* If an agent is still sending data from an app, you cannot remove that app.

## Remove an application from New Relic [#remove]

Before you can remove an application monitored by New Relic APM, browser monitoring, or mobile monitoring, the app must first stop reporting data. Do this by disabling the agent (explained below) or by [uninstalling the agent completely](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/uninstall-agent).

    1. Disable an APM agent using these instructions:
       * [<DNT>**Go**</DNT>](/docs/agents/go-agent/instrumentation/go-agent-configuration#enabled): Set `Enabled` to `false`.
       * [<DNT>**Java**</DNT>](/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file#cfg-agent_enabled): Set `agent_enabled` to `false`.
       * [<DNT>**.NET**</DNT>](/docs/agents/net-agent/installation-configuration/net-agent-configuration#app-cfg-agent-enabled): Set `Newrelic.AgentEnabled` to `false`.
       * [<DNT>**Node.js**</DNT>](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration#enabled): Set `agent_enabled` to `false`.
       * [<DNT>**PHP**</DNT>](/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration#inivar-enabled): Remove or disable both the `newrelic.so` and [`newrelic-daemon`](/docs/agents/php-agent/getting-started/new-relic-daemon-processes) components. Set `newrelic.enabled` to `false`.
       * [<DNT>**Python**</DNT>](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-configuration#monitor_mode): Set `monitor_mode` to `false`.
       * [<DNT>**Ruby**</DNT>](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/installation-configuration/ruby-agent-configuration#agent_enabled): Set `agent_enabled` to `false`.
    2. Restart the application server and wait up to ten minutes. Verify the color-coded [health status](/docs/accounts-partnerships/education/getting-started-new-relic/glossary#health-status) for the app has turned to gray and is no longer reporting data.
    3. To remove the APM application from the UI (and any [associated apps in browser monitoring](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent/#select-apm-app)), use the following steps:
       * <DNT>**Delete the app from the UI.**</DNT> Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services > (select an app/service) > Settings > Application**</DNT>, and click the <DNT>**Delete application**</DNT> button.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="remove-browser-apps"
    title="Browser"
  >
    If you've used the [copy/paste method to install the browser agent](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation/install-new-relic-browser-agent#copy-paste-app), remove the JavaScript snippet from your application's pages.

    After 93 days, that app will be removed from the UI. If you want to remove it sooner than that, you have several options:

    * <DNT>**Delete an associated APM app.**</DNT> If your browser app is [linked to an APM application](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent/#select-apm-app), deleting the APM application also removes the browser application. See the [instructions for deleting an APM app](#remove-apm-apps).
    * <DNT>**Delete it from the UI.**</DNT> Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Browser > (select an app) > Settings > Application settings**</DNT>, and click the <DNT>**Delete application**</DNT> button.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="remove-mobile-apps"
    title="Mobile"
  >
    Remove all references/dependencies to New Relic's mobile monitoring SDK/frameworks, then rebuild the application. For more information, see the [iOS](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/installation) and [Android](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/install-configure) install docs.

    After 93 days, the app will be removed from the UI. If you want to remove it sooner than that, you have several options:

    * <DNT>**Remove it using the UI.**</DNT> Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Mobile > (select an app) > Settings > Application**</DNT>, and click <DNT>**Delete application**</DNT>.
    * <DNT>**Use NerdGraph to delete an entity.**</DNT> If you've done the above and are still seeing that app in the UI, you can [use NerdGraph to delete the relevant entities](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-entities-api-tutorial/#delete-entities). For how to find entity IDs, see [Entities](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/#find).

## Troubleshooting [#troubleshooting]

If you have problems removing an app, here are some possible causes and suggested solutions:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="not-owner-admin"
    title="You lack permissions"
  >
    If you don't have relevant [permissions](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/account-structure/factors-affecting-access-features-data), you won't be able to remove an application.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="wait-longer"
    title="You have not waited long enough"
  >
    All app data must stop reporting to New Relic before you can remove that entity from New Relic. You can delete an application when it has not received any incoming data for 12 hours.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="agents-not-disabled"
    title="Not all agents are disabled"
  >
    If you have multiple agents reporting data under the same UI name, then you must make sure you disable or uninstall <DNT>**all**</DNT> of the agents associated with that entity.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="php-issues"
    title="You have problems removing your PHP app"
  >
    If you have a PHP app and aren't able to remove it from the UI, possible causes include:

    * You have not disabled both components of the PHP agent. You must stop or uninstall both `newrelic.so` and `newrelic-daemon` in order to be able to remove a PHP app. For more information, see [New Relic daemon processes](/docs/agents/php-agent/getting-started/new-relic-daemon-processes).
    * You have set up per-directory monitoring of your PHP app, and unexpected PHP data is reporting as the default PHP application in the New Relic UI. To fix this, change the [default app name in the PHP agent config](/docs/agents/php-agent/configuration/php-agent-configuration#inivar-appname).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="name-confusion"
    title="You don't know where the app's data is coming from"
  >
    If you don't know where an app's data is coming from, it may be because the [app's name has been changed](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/rename-your-application). When an app name is changed in the UI, it does not change the underlying app name being reported; it only changes how the app name appears in the UI.

    To see if there is a difference between the reported name and the displayed name:

    1. From <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**</DNT>, select <DNT>**APM**</DNT>, then select an application.

    2. Scroll down to <DNT>**Settings**</DNT> and select <DNT>**Application.**</DNT>

    3. Compare the name in the <DNT>**Application alias**</DNT> field to the name in the <DNT>**Your application still reports as**</DNT> message directly beneath it.

       To get host information about an app you are not familiar with:

    4. From <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)**</DNT>, select <DNT>**APM**</DNT>, then select an application.

    5. From the summary view, review the <DNT>**Servers**</DNT> list.

       Once you have identified where app data is coming from, you can remove the app from New Relic.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="browser-reporting"
    title="Browser data is still reporting"
  >
    To remove an app from New Relic, all data must have stopped reporting, including browser monitoring data. To verify that you have disabled or uninstalled the APM agent associated with the app:

    1. Ensure that [browser monitoring is disabled](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation-configuration/browser-settings-ui-options-browser-monitoring#disabling).
       * If your browser monitoring script is inserted by the APM agent, turn it off from inside the UI, in the agent's config file, or in both.
       * If you copied and pasted the monitoring JavaScript snippet in certain pages, remove that JavaScript snippet manually.
    2. Ensure all caches have been cleared that the application uses, such as host caches, CDNs, or anything else that caches built pages.
    3. Optional: To see a count of how many page views report from each domain, use this [NRQL query](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql):

       ```sql
       SELECT count(*) FROM PageView WHERE appName = 'YOUR_BROWSER_APP_NAME' FACET domain
       ```

       If these steps don't resolve the issue, it is likely due to an end-user's browser cache that hasn't yet cleared. Wait until those caches clear. If your app has internal users, you may be able to identify the users and clear those caches.
