You may want to temporarily disable an APM agent for the purposes of testing or troubleshooting. This document explains procedures for temporarily turning off the APM agent.

Related procedures:

* To permanently disable APM, [uninstall the agent](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/uninstall-agent).
* To configure an agent to monitor some things but not others, use [custom instrumentation](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/custom-instrumentation).

## Disable the APM agent [#agents]

Select your agent type for instructions:

    The C SDK cannot be turned on or off directly. However, you can write your code for the SDK so that a quick recompile and deploy can enable or disable your instrumentation. Follow standard procedures to [disable or uninstall the C SDK](/docs/agents/c-sdk/install-configure/uninstall-remove-c-sdk).

    There are two main ways to disable the Go agent:

    * Remove the import of the `github.com/newrelic/go-agent` package from your application, and remove or comment out any calls to the `newrelic` namespace. Then, recompile and restart your app.
    * Use the [`enabled`](/docs/agents/go-agent/configuration/go-agent-configuration#enabled) configuration setting. Then, recompile and restart your app. (This will **not** reduce overhead because the instrumentation is still running; it will only prevent the sending of data to the [New Relic collector](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#collector).)

    There are three main ways to disable the Java agent:

    * Set [`agent_enabled`](/docs/agents/java-agent/configuration/java-agent-configuration-config-file#cfg-agent_enabled) to `false`, then restart the JVM.
    * Use the JVM command line flag:

      ```
      -Dnewrelic.config.agent_enabled=false
      ```

      Then restart the JVM.
    * Remove the `newrelic.jar` or `newrelic.yml` file, then restart the JVM.

    The method to disable the agent depends on if you are using Framework or Core:

    * .NET Framework: Set [`agentEnabled`](/docs/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration#config-agentEnabled) to `false` in the global `newrelic.config` file, found in `C:\ProgramData\New Relic\.NET Agent\`. If the application is IIS-hosted, restart IIS. If it's self-hosted (non-IIS), restart the application.
    * .NET Core: Set [`agentEnabled`](/docs/agents/net-agent/configuration/net-agent-configuration#config-agentEnabled) to `false` in the `newrelic.config` file found in the Core agentâ€™s installation directory (for Windows alongside `NewRelic.Profiler.dll` and for Linux alongside `NewRelic.Profiler.so`). If you use the ASP.NET Core Module, reset IIS. Otherwise, restart your Core application.

    There are two main ways to disable the Node.js agent:

    * Set [`agent_enabled`](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration#enabled) to `false` in your agent config file, then restart the app server.
    * Set the [`NEW_RELIC_ENABLED`](/docs/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration#enabled) environment variable to `false`.

    There are three main ways to disable the Python agent, depending on your preference and setup:

    * [Standard install](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation/standard-python-agent-install#install): Use the [`monitor_mode`](/docs/agents/python-agent/configuration/python-agent-configuration#monitor_mode) configuration setting. This can be done by editing the config file or by using an [environment variable](/docs/agents/python-agent/configuration/python-agent-configuration#environment-variables).
    * Standard install with `newrelic-admin` script: Remove reference to that script in your application.
    * [Manual instrumentation](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-integration#manual-integration): Remove the initialization script from your application.

    There are several ways to disable the Ruby agent, depending on your preference and setup.

    These methods will remove most instrumentation but there will still be a small amount of activity and overhead:

    * Use the [`agent_enabled`](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/configuration/ruby-agent-configuration#agent_enabled) configuration setting. This can be done in the configuration file or in the per-environment stanzas. Restart your app server afterward.
    * Do the same via an [environment variable](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/configuration/ruby-agent-configuration#Options), then restart the app server.

    The following methods will remove all instrumentation and overhead:

    * Remove `newrelic_rpm` from the Gemfile and bundle install.
    * Set the following in the Gemfile and bundle install:

      ```
      gem 'newrelic_rpm', :require => false
      ```

      This option ensures the gem is installed if it's required somewhere in the app, but doesn't install it when bundling.
