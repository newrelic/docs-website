<Callout variant="important">
  We recommend that you use the [change tracking](/docs/change-tracking/change-tracking-introduction/) feature instead of the older deployment markers. If you've been using deployment markers feature, you can still use it, but keep in mind that the change tracking feature is available for <InlinePopover type="browser"/> and <InlinePopover type="mobile"/>, as well as <InlinePopover type="apm"/>.
</Callout>

Deploying an app can be a risky eventâ€”when your app breaks, and a bad deployment is often the cause. New Relic allows you to track deployments so you can correlate deployments with changes in your app's performance. Tracking deployments creates deployment markers that appear in APM charts and dashboards.

See how deployment markers work in this short video (4:30 minutes):
<Video id="HPeXZubcZ7o" type="youtube"/>

## Options for tracking deployments [#options]

You can use the New Relic [REST API v2](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/new-relic-rest-api-v2-getting-started) to record new deployments and retrieve a list of past deployments. In addition, some APM agents have agent-specific methods to record deployments automatically.

You can use your [Slack](https://slack.com/) integration with New Relic, or a simple webhook, to notify your team in real time of deployments for applications monitored by APM. Slack provides a webhook URL that allows you to post generic JSON that will appear formatted in a chosen Slack channel.

There are a few places where you can view deployments in the New Relic UI after they have been recorded:

* In the activity feed on the [APM Summary](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page-view-transaction-apdex-usage-data), Service summary, and [entity summary pages](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/new-relic-one-entity-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts).
* On APM performance charts as chart markers (vertical lines with pinheads).
* On dashboard charts as chart markers.
* On the [Deployments](/docs/apm/applications-menu/events/deployments-page-view-impact-your-app-users) page for summary performance.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Deployment markers are not available for browser applications, but you can try these alternatives:

  * Switch from deployment markers to the [change tracking](/docs/change-tracking/change-tracking-introduction) feature that enables you to track browser application changes.
  * See [browser releases](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/add-release) for a way to tag errors with release versions.
</Callout>

## Record deployments with the REST API [#api-instructions]

You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record deployments and get a list of past deployments.

* The examples in this document use `curl` as a command line tool. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. You can also create and view deployments with the [API Explorer](https://rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/application_deployments/create).
* JSON uses double quotes `"` for element names and content. Using single quotes `'` will cause errors.
* The examples use `X-Api-Key` which can be used for either a <a href="/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#user-api-key">user key</a> or a <a href="/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#rest-api-key">REST API key</a>. User keys are now the preferred way of accessing our REST APIs, and you may use `Api-Key` headers when using them.

    title="Record a deployment with POST"

    To record a new deployment, send a `POST` request that includes your [API key](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-rest-api-v2#api_key) to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see [Character limits and JSON parameters](#deployment_limits)). All payload parameters are optional except `revision`.

    For example:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json" \
         -H "X-Api-Key:$API_KEY" \
         -i \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d \
    '{
        "deployment": {
            "revision": "REVISION",
            "changelog": "Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None",
            "description": "Added a deployments resource to the v2 API",
            "user": "datanerd@example.com",
            "timestamp": "2019-10-08T00:15:36Z"
        }
    }'
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="powershell"
    title="Record a deployment with PowerShell"
  >
    To record a deployment with PowerShell, send a `POST` request that includes your [API key](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-rest-api-v2#api_key) to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see [Character limits and JSON parameters](#deployment_limits)). All payload parameters are optional except `revision`.

    This example uses PowerShell version 3 or higher:

    ```powershell
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json -Method POST -Headers @{'X-Api-Key'='$API_KEY'} -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{
        "deployment": {
            "revision": "REVISION",
            "changelog": "Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None",
            "description": "Added a deployments resource to the v2 API",
            "user": "datanerd@example.com",
            "timestamp": "2019-10-08T00:15:36Z"
        }
    }'
    ```

    This example uses PowerShell version 2 (requires .NET framework 3.5 or higher):

    ```powershell
    $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding("ASCII")
    $data ='{
        "deployment": {
            "revision": "REVISION",
            "changelog": "Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None",
            "description": "Added a deployments resource to the v2 API",
            "user": "datanerd@example.com",
            "timestamp": "2019-10-08T00:15:36Z"
        }
    }'
    $postData = $encoding.GetBytes($data)
    $request = [System.Net.WebRequest]::Create('https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json')
    $request.Method = 'POST'
    $request.Headers.add('X-Api-Key','$API_KEY')
    $request.ContentType='application/json'
    $stream = $request.GetRequestStream()
    $stream.Write($postData,0,$postData.Length)
    $request.GetResponse()
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="get-list"
    title="View a list of deployments with GET"
  >
    To retrieve a list of all past deployments for your app, send a `GET` request that includes your [API key](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-rest-api-v2#api_key) to the deployments endpoint. GET requests do not use a JSON payload.

    For example:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json" \
         -H "X-Api-Key:$API_KEY" \
         -i
    ```

    <CollapserGroup>
      <Collapser
        id="sample-get-output"
        title="Sample output from GET"
      >
        This example requests a list of deployments for app ID `9999999`:

        ```bash
        curl -X GET "https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/9999999/deployments.json" \
             -H "X-Api-Key:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx" \
             -i
        ```

        The API returns this list of deployments:

        ```json

## Record deployments using the New Relic agent [#agent]

Some agents have additional methods to record deployments:

* <DNT>**All agents**</DNT>: Use the New Relic [REST API v2](#api).
* <DNT>**C**</DNT>: No SDK-specific methods. Use the [REST API](#api).
* <DNT>**Go**</DNT>: No agent-specific methods. Use the [REST API](#api).
* <DNT>**Java**</DNT>: Call the [Java agent `jar`](/docs/agents/java-agent/instrumentation/recording-deployments-java-agent).
* <DNT>**.NET**</DNT>: Use [PowerShell and the REST API](#powershell).
* <DNT>**Node.js**</DNT>: No agent-specific methods. Use the [REST API](#api).
* <DNT>**PHP**</DNT>: Use a [PHP script](/docs/agents/php-agent/features/recording-deployments-using-php-script).
* <DNT>**Python**</DNT>: Use the [`record-deploy`](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-admin-script#record-deploy) subcommand of the `newrelic-admin` script.
* <DNT>**Ruby**</DNT>: Use a [Capistrano recipe](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/features/recording-deployments-ruby-agent#capistrano3).

## View deployment details [#dep_procedures]

After you configure the deployment information, you can view and drill down into details in the UI. For tips, see our change tracking document [How to view and analyze your changes in New Relic](/docs/change-tracking/change-tracking-view-analyze).

## Notify your team about deployments [#webhooks]

Whether you're tracking deployments with the REST API or the newer [GraphQL API](/docs/change-tracking/change-tracking-introduction), you can notify your team members using a webhook. For details, see the change tracking [webhook instructions](/docs/change-tracking/change-tracking-webhooks).
