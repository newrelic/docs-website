<Callout variant="important">
  We recommend that you use the [change tracking](/docs/change-tracking/change-tracking-introduction/) feature instead of the older deployment markers. If you've been using deployment markers feature, you can still use it, but keep in mind that the change tracking feature is available for browser and mobile, as well as APM.
</Callout>

Deploying an app can be a risky eventâ€”when your app breaks, and a bad deployment is often the cause. New Relic allows you to track deployments so you can correlate deployments with changes in your app's performance. Tracking deployments creates deployment markers that appear in APM charts and dashboards.

See how deployment markers work in this short video (4:30 minutes):
<Video id="HPeXZubcZ7o" type="youtube"/>

## Options for tracking deployments [#options]

You can use the New Relic [REST API v2](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/new-relic-rest-api-v2-getting-started) to record new deployments and retrieve a list of past deployments. In addition, some APM agents have agent-specific methods to record deployments automatically.

You can use your [Slack](https://slack.com/) integration with New Relic, or a simple webhook, to notify your team in real time of deployments for applications monitored by APM. Slack provides a webhook URL that allows you to post generic JSON that will appear formatted in a chosen Slack channel.

There are a few places where you can view deployments in the New Relic UI after they have been recorded:

* In the activity feed on the [APM Summary](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/apm-overview-page-view-transaction-apdex-usage-data), Service summary, and [entity summary pages](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/new-relic-one-entity-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts).
* On APM performance charts as chart markers (vertical lines with pinheads).
* On dashboard charts as chart markers.
* On the [Deployments](/docs/apm/applications-menu/events/deployments-page-view-impact-your-app-users) page for summary performance.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Deployment markers are not available for browser applications, but you can try these alternatives:
  * Switch from deployment markers to the [change tracking](/docs/change-tracking/change-tracking-introduction) feature that enables you to track browser application changes.
  * See [browser releases](/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/browser-agent-spa-api/add-release) for a way to tag errors with release versions.
</Callout>

## Record deployments with the REST API [#api-instructions]

You can use the New Relic REST API v2 to record deployments and get a list of past deployments.

* The examples in this document use `curl` as a command line tool. However, you can use any method to make your REST requests. You can also create and view deployments with the [API Explorer](https://rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore/application_deployments/create).
* JSON uses double quotes `"` for element names and content. Using single quotes `'` will cause errors.
* The examples use `X-Api-Key` which can be used for either a <a href="/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#user-api-key">user key</a> or a <a href="/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#rest-api-key">REST API key</a>. User keys are now the preferred way of accessing our REST APIs, and you may use `Api-Key` headers when using them.

    title="Record a deployment with POST"
  >
    To record a new deployment, send a `POST` request that includes your [API key](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-rest-api-v2#api_key) to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see [Character limits and JSON parameters](#deployment_limits)). All payload parameters are optional except `revision`.

    For example:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json" \
         -H "X-Api-Key:$API_KEY" \
         -i \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d \
    '{
        "deployment": {
            "revision": "REVISION",
            "changelog": "Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None",
            "description": "Added a deployments resource to the v2 API",
            "user": "datanerd@example.com",
            "timestamp": "2019-10-08T00:15:36Z"
        }
    }'
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="powershell"
    title="Record a deployment with PowerShell"
  >
    To record a deployment with PowerShell, send a `POST` request that includes your [API key](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-rest-api-v2#api_key) to the deployments endpoint. Attach the payload in JSON format (see [Character limits and JSON parameters](#deployment_limits)). All payload parameters are optional except `revision`.

    This example uses PowerShell version 3 or higher:

    ```powershell
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/YOUR_APP_ID/deployments.json -Method POST -Headers @{'X-Api-Key'='$API_KEY'} -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{
        "deployment": {
            "revision": "REVISION",
            "changelog": "Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None",
            "description": "Added a deployments resource to the v2 API",
            "user": "datanerd@example.com",
            "timestamp": "2019-10-08T00:15:36Z"
        }
    }'
    ```

    This example uses PowerShell version 2 (requires .NET framework 3.5 or higher):

    ```powershell
    $encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::GetEncoding("ASCII")
    $data ='{
        "deployment": {
            "revision": "REVISION",
            "changelog": "Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None",
            "description": "Added a deployments resource to the v2 API",
            "user": "datanerd@example.com",
            "timestamp": "2019-10-08T00:15:36Z"
        }
    }'
    $postData = $encoding.GetBytes($data)
    $request = [System.Net.WebRequest]::Create('https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json')
    $request.Method = 'POST'
    $request.Headers.add('X-Api-Key','$API_KEY')
    $request.ContentType='application/json'
    $stream = $request.GetRequestStream()
    $stream.Write($postData,0,$postData.Length)
    $request.GetResponse()
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="get-list"
    title="View a list of deployments with GET"
  >
    To retrieve a list of all past deployments for your app, send a `GET` request that includes your [API key](/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-rest-api-v2#api_key) to the deployments endpoint. GET requests do not use a JSON payload.

    For example:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/$APP_ID/deployments.json" \
         -H "X-Api-Key:$API_KEY" \
         -i
    ```

    <CollapserGroup>
      <Collapser
        id="sample-get-output"
        title="Sample output from GET"
      >
        This example requests a list of deployments for app ID `9999999`:

        ```bash
        curl -X GET "https://api.newrelic.com/v2/applications/9999999/deployments.json" \
             -H "X-Api-Key:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwx" \
             -i
        ```

        The API returns this list of deployments:

## Record deployments using the New Relic agent [#agent]

Some agents have additional methods to record deployments:

* **All agents**: Use the New Relic [REST API v2](#api).
* **C**: No SDK-specific methods. Use the [REST API](#api).
* **Go**: No agent-specific methods. Use the [REST API](#api).
* **Java**: Call the [Java agent `jar`](/docs/agents/java-agent/instrumentation/recording-deployments-java-agent).
* **.NET**: Use [PowerShell and the REST API](#powershell).
* **Node.js**: No agent-specific methods. Use the [REST API](#api).
* **PHP**: Use a [PHP script](/docs/agents/php-agent/features/recording-deployments-using-php-script).
* **Python**: Use the [`record-deploy`](/docs/agents/python-agent/installation-configuration/python-agent-admin-script#record-deploy) subcommand of the `newrelic-admin` script.
* **Ruby**: Use a [Capistrano recipe](/docs/agents/ruby-agent/features/recording-deployments-ruby-agent#capistrano3).

## Notify your team about deployments [#webhooks]

After a deployment is recorded, through either the REST API or the newer [GraphQL API](/docs/change-tracking/change-tracking-introduction), you can notify your team members using a webhook.

You can send deployment data to a variety of webhook destinations. Simply follow the instructions for whatever tool you're using&mdash;except Slack. If you want to use a Slack webhook, you must use the legacy New Relic Alerts app instead of the New Relic Slack app like this:

1. Log in to your Slack account as an admin, and then go to **Apps**.
2. Search for **New Relic Alerts**, and click on that tile when it appears.
3. In the **New Relic Alerts** listing, click the **Configuration** button below the New Relic icon.
4. Click the **Configuration** tab below the heading **New Relic Alerts**.
5. On the **Configuration** tab, click the pencil icon.
6. Scroll down to the **Webhook URL** section, and click **Copy URL**.
7. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > ([user menu](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/general-account-settings/intro-account-settings)) > Administration > Integrations > Deploy notifications**.
8. Paste the Slack webhook URL into **Webhook URL**.
9. Click **Integrate with webhooks**.

## View deployment details [#dep_procedures]

<Callout variant="important">
  This section and the next are about how to use the current deployment markers UI. If you see a blue banner in the UI about being in a limited preview, you have access to the the new UI. In this case, switch to these new [instructions](/docs/apm/apm-ui-pages/events/change-tracking/deployments-page-view-impact-your-app-users/).

</Callout>

After you configure the deployment information, you can view and drill down into details:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services > (select an app) > Events > Deployments**.
2. Use any of New Relic's standard [user interface functions](/docs/data-analysis/user-interface-functions/standard-page-functions) to drill down into detailed information.
3. To view details for a particular event, select its **date** link.
4. To view the errors page for this deployment, select the **error** link.
5. To view details for a specific deployment if applicable, select **Change log** or **Change report**.

The **Change log** contains any detail provided through the `changelog` parameter when [recording the deployment](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/maintenance/recording-deployments). The **Change report** displays the behavior of the top ten transactions before and after the deployment.

## View performance after a deployment [#dep_timepicker]

The **Deployments** page link for individual deployments appears on the selected app's [Summary](/docs/applications-menu/applications-overview) page in the **Events** section. For time frames shorter than 14 days, a blue vertical bar on a chart will indicate a deployment. To view summary information about the deployment, mouse over the blue bar.

<Callout variant="tip">
  You can also use the **Compare with** option on your APM summary page to select a time period to compare the same data. If you enable **Compare with**, the UI does not show deployment markers.
</Callout>
