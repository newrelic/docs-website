## Why it matters [#matters]

Errors inbox provides a unified error tracking experience to detect and triage errors:

- View and triage issues across applicaitons and services that your team cares about.
- Proactive notifications with detailed error information.
- Error profiles to show similarities between error events and surface the root cause.
- Analyze errors in context of the full stack, and resolve errors with precision.
- Triage and tackle errors, including APM, RUM, mobile, and serverless Lambda functions).

## Set up Errors inbox [#get-started]

To enable Errors inbox, follow these steps below. Afterwards, errors groups should start to appear in your inbox.

1. From [one.newrelic.com](one.newrelic.com) select **More** in the top right and click **Errors inbox** from the dropdown.
2. If this is your first time accessing Errors inbox, you will be prompted to select a [workload](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/workloads/workloads-isolate-resolve-incidents-faster/) in the top left. 

Once you select your workload, your inbox should populate with error groups. If you have no workloads set up, you will [need to create one](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/workloads/use-workloads/) before you can use the Errors inbox.

## Proactively monitor your errors [#monitor]

Once you've set up your Errors inbox, you can begin proactively monitoring all errors in your stack:

1. **Error groups**: Your Errors inbox automatically groups your errors so you can easily review all the unique errors within your system.
2. **Occurrences**: Your errors inbox displays the total number of occurences of each errors within the selected timeframe. The corresponding sparkline chart displays the total number of occurences per day over the selected timeframe.
3. **Status**: You can set the status of an error by selecting the dropdown and choosing either **Unresolved**, **Resolve**, or **Ignore**. You can ignore errors to reduce noise, leave it unresolved, or proactively resolve the error.
4. **Assign errors**: Assign errors directly to individuals. 

## Dive deeper with error details [#error-details]

Clicking on a specific error group takes you to the error details page, where you will find full context of the issue. This context can assist in triaging the error and assigning it to the correct team or individual. This includes details like:
- Related account
- Stack trace
- Error attributes
- Number and frequency of occurrences

The detailed view also allows you to view specific errors. In the top right, you can navigate between the first instance of the error, the last, and any instance inbetween.
