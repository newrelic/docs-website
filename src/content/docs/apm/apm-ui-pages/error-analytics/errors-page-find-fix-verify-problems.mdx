<Callout variant="important" title="EOL NOTICE">
  As of March 2022, we're discontinuing support for several capabilities, including our errors classic UI. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/important-upcoming-changes-to-capabilities-and-support-across-errors-classic-labels-service-infrastructure-on-host-snmp-integration-and-inventory-data-in-cloud-integrations/175370).
</Callout>

With the **Errors** UI in New Relic One, you can see the line of code that's causing a bad experience for your users, and get enough data to reproduce the issue so you can fix it. When you do, you’ll be able to confirm your fix is working in production.

Use **Errors** in New Relic One to:

* Group and filter events to triage important errors.
* Get alert notifications about errors.
* Review stack traces, [logs](#logs-context), and other details.
* Share the error information with charts and dashboards.
* Report new errors using instrumentation, prevent certain errors from being reported, and filter out noisy errors using [**expected errors**](#expected-errors).

## View the APM Errors page [#error_procedures]

To view the **Errors** page:

* Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > APM > (select an app)**, then click the **Error rate** table's title on your selected app's **Summary** page.

  OR
* Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > APM > (select an app) > Events > Errors**.

  **APM Errors UI:** The **Error rate** chart always shows the rate for all errors, even if a filter is applied. To drill down further, use grouping and filter options for the **Top 5 by count** chart and **Error traces** table. Use the **Instance** dropdown to focus on a specific instance.
</figcaption>

## Use the Errors workflow to identify problems [#error_event]

Use this basic workflow to get the most out of the information you see from the **Errors** page.

1. Start with the [**Error rate** chart](#error-rate-chart) to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with errors in general.
2. Correlate any general patterns on the [**Top 5 errors** chart](#top5-errors-chart) to alerts occurring during the same time period. Use the groups and filters to examine the error events and attributes in more detail, and look for patterns with error messages, transaction names, or other groupings.
3. Explore and share [**Error trace** table](#traces-table) information, including specific stack trace details, logs, and attributes (host, URL, user, custom attributes, etc.)
4. Also review the [**Error profiles** page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/error-analytics/apm-error-profiles-troubleshoot-trends) to guide your investigation into which attribute values might be correlated to the cause of errors, by comparing the frequency of those values between transactions where the error did and didn't occur (only in the old UI).

  >
    Start with the **Error rate** chart to see at a glance whether there are any unexpected spikes, dips, or patterns with errors in general. For example, are there any spikes near a recent deployment? You may want to change the [selected time period](#time-period) to look for other historical patterns.

    This chart always shows the overall error rate and count for the selected time period, even when you filter the rest of the page. If you want to focus your investigation on a particular type of error, use the [**Top 5 errors** chart](#top5-errors-chart) or the [**Error traces** table](#traces-table).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="top5-errors-chart"
    title="Top five errors: Correlate to alerts or find significant groupings"
  >
    Use the **Top 5 errors** chart to identify what error types and how many of those errors occurred during the same time period as the **Error rate** chart. For example:

    * Is the error spike related to a specific exception class or transaction?
    * Do the top errors point to a new host/container that recently got moved into production?
    * Are the top error messages repeatedly about failed connections by hosts that you know are in a specific region of your organization?
    * Have the chart backgrounds changed color to indicate an [alert condition](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/configuring-alert-policies/define-thresholds-trigger-alert)? (Light pink indicates the alert condition's **Warning** threshold, and dark pink indicates the **Critical** threshold.)

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
            **If you want to...**
          </th>

          <th>

          <td>
            By default, **Top 5 errors** chart shows the top five errors by error class and transaction name. To group by other attributes, such as error message, host, or custom attribute, use the search bar.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>

            Explore or share error trend data
          </td>

          <td>
            The **Top 5 errors** chart uses [error events](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/decorating-events/error-event-default-attributes-insights), which include rich attribute data b default, along with any custom attributes you have added to the error event type. To examine this data in more detail, or to share it with others, select the **View query** or **Add to dashboard** links that appear when you click the chart's **...** menu.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="traces-table"
    title="Error traces: Find the line of code and data needed to reproduce the issue"
  >
    The **Error traces** table groups errors by the attributes you've selected, and links them to relevant detailed error traces.

    Each row helps you find answers to questions such as:

    * How many of this transaction/class (or custom grouping) occurred within the selected time period?
    * What is the most recent error message?
    * When did this error first and last occur?

    Sometimes it may be useful to sort error trace data other than from the most to fewest occurrences. You can change the sort order or filter options to focus on just the types of errors that matter the most to you and your teams. For example:

    * Which error has the fewest occurrences (sort on **Errors** column)?
    * When did a particular error stop (sort on **Last occurred**)?

    Once you find the group of errors you want to fix, click a row in the **Error traces** table to drill down into the [stack traces and attribute data](/docs/apm/applications-menu/error-analytics/error-analytics-manage-error-traces) that help pinpoint the cause.

## Examine logs for error details [#logs-context]

You can bring your logs and application's data together to make troubleshooting easier and faster. With [logs in context](/docs/logs/logs-context/configure-logs-context-apm-agents/), you can see log messages related to your errors and traces directly in your app's UI.

1. From the **Errors** page, click on an error to go to the **Error details** page.
2. From the error details page, click **See logs**.
3. To view details related to an individual log message, click directly on the message.

![Logs in context of APM error details](./images/logs-in-context-errors.png "Logs in context of APM error details")

<figcaption>
  With logs in context, you can examine log data directly within your error details.
</figcaption>

You can also see logs in context of your [infrastructure data](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/), such as Kubernetes clusters. No need to switch to another UI page in New Relic One.

### Expected errors

Reduce noisy errors by marking them as “expected errors”. Such errors won't affect reported error rate or Apdex metrics. See [Manage errors](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/manage-errors-apm-collect-ignore-or-mark-expected#expected) for more details.

Expected errors aren't shown by default on the Errors page. You can show them by turning on the **Show N expected errors** switch below the **Group by** bar.

### Errors outside transactions

Using the New Relic agent API, you can [record custom errors](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/manage-errors-apm-collect-ignore-or-mark-expected#error-collection) at any point in the execution of your code. Sometimes, such custom errors will occur when a transaction is not executing, such as in high-volume aynchronous code that doesn't handle an HTTP transaction.

Errors outside transactions are shown by default on the Errors page, but you can hide them by turning off the **Show N errors outside transactions** switch below the **Group by** bar.

## Select the time period for error data [#select-time-period]

Use the [time picker](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/basic-ui-features) to examine details of [error events](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data/apm-default-events-insights) over the past week. The error events view is available for up to a seven-day window of data collected over the last eight days.

You may notice slight differences in count if your time window is set to ending now. This occurs because the counts for the list and table may be requested at slightly different times as the page auto-refreshes.
