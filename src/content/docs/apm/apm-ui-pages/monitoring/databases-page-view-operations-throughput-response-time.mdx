In APM, the **Databases** page shows an application's database and cache data. The page shows individual database transactions as a sortable table, and operations, throughput, and response time as charts. If [slow queries](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/viewing-slow-query-details) have been reported, they are shown when you select a transaction.

We divide the database information into three parts:

* All-databases overview (main page)
  * Top five database operations by wall-clock time
  * Database response time
  * Database throughput (operation requests per minute or **rpm**)
* Top database operations (subpage)
  * Query time
  * Throughput
  * Time consumption by caller
* Table with all database operations (subpage)

  As of June 30, 2022, we're discontinuing support for several capabilities, including the classic APM **Databases** page that you could toggle on and off in the UI. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our [Support Forum post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/q1-bulk-eol-announcement-fy23/181744).

## Navigation [#database-page]

Choose one of the following to open the page:

* Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > All entities > (select an app) > Monitor > Databases**.
* Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services > (select an app) > Monitor > Databases**.

<Callout variant="tip">
  To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the [New Relic Explorer](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/new-relic-one-entity-explorer).
</Callout>

## Filter operations by database vendor [#db_filtering]

If available: Above the list of database operations, buttons allow you to [filter](#availablity) down to a specific database vendor.

* To filter the contents by database vendor, select its name.
* To remove the filter, select **All**.

## Review top database operations [#top_db_operations]

The main **Databases** page shows a list of top database operations that you can sort in a variety of ways.

To get details about an operation, you can either hover over the record, or you can click on it to see additional charts.

When you click on a record, you can see the **Time consumption by caller** chart. This displays a list of the transactions calling the selected operation, with color bars indicating the percentage of time consumed by each caller. To view the **Transactions** page for a caller transaction, select the color bar for that transaction in the chart.

## Display all database operations [#db_displaying]

To show all database operations [if available](#availability):

* At the bottom of the operations list, select the **Show all database operations table...** link.
* To sort the table by any column, select the column's header.
* To filter the list of operations, use the search box at the top of the table.
* To view details on a specific operation, select the operation name.

## Delete traces [#db_deleting]

To delete all traces for your app permanently:

1. Select the **Delete all traces** button below the database operations list.
2. Select the confirmation prompt.

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you are doing general record cleanup, you may also want to delete [transaction traces](/docs/traces/deleting-transaction-traces) or [error traces](/docs/apm/applications-menu/events/viewing-apm-errors-error-traces). This will remove potentially sensitive data while retaining your other application data (such as Apdex, deployment information, etc.).

## Additional features based on agent version [#availablity]

Additional features on the **Databases** page are available with following agent versions. For more information, see [Update the New Relic agent](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/installation/update-new-relic-agent).

* Go 1.4 or higher
* Java 3.14.0 or higher
* .NET 4.1.134 or higher
* Node.js 1.17.0 or higher
* PHP 4.19.0 or higher
* Python 2.44.0 or higher
* Ruby 3.11.0 or higher

These features include:

* Multiple database and cache types
* Labels for different types in the operations list, charts, and slow queries
* Filtering operations and charts for a specific database vendor or cache type
* Viewing a table of all database operations
* Ability to view the databases on [Service maps](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/service-maps)

In addition, if your APM agent supports [host and instance level details](/docs/apm/applications-menu/features/analyze-database-instance-level-performance-issues), you can view both the query details and the specific instance where the query was executed.
