Use [New Relic Lookout](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-lookout-monitor-your-estate-glance/) to detect deviations in your APM service entities' three golden signals (response time, error rate, and throughput) and analyze the behavior and causes of those deviations.

## How does it work?

On the **APM summary** page, Lookout compares the values of golden signals within the past five minutes against its values over the preceding hour. If Lookout detects a signifigant upward or downard trend in the signal, a **Diagnose** button appears on the corresponding APM summary chat.

When clicked, the button opens a diagnostic Lookout tool which you can use to explore details about your golden signals.
