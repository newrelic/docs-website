The APM **Summary** page provides general information about the selected app, including [web transactions](/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/transactions-new-relic-apm) and [non-web transactions](/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/monitor-background-processes-other-non-web-transactions), [Apdex](/docs/site/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction) score, CPU usage, throughput (requests per minute or **rpm**), transaction times, error rate, application activity, and [hosts](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/compute-unit-pricing-host-pricing#understand).

## View your app's summary page [#overview]

To reach the **Summary** page, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Explorer > Services - APM > (select an app)**. Use the [Explorer](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/new-relic-explorer-view-performance-across-apps-services-hosts/) to access all your [entities](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/), that is, anything we can identify that reports data, from applications and hosts to custom groupings of any elements.

Alternatively, you can go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services > (select an app)**.

  As of June 30, 2022, we're discontinuing support for several capabilities, including the classic APM **Summary** page that you could toggle on and off in the UI. For more details, including how you can easily prepare for this transition, see our [Explorers Hub post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/q1-bulk-eol-announcement-fy23/181744).

          <td>
            This stacked chart represents the response time of [web transactions](/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/transactions-new-relic-apm) or [non-web transactions](/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/monitor-background-processes-other-non-web-transactions) in your app. Segments in the chart vary depending on which agent you are using. Some charts may have an independent line for **response time** that represents the relationship between [response time and total time](/docs/using-new-relic/user-interface-functions/view-your-data/response-time#response-time-total-time).

            Also, for your external or background services, you may see data labeled as [`Web external`](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary#web-external). For more information about these out-of-process services, use the [**Externals** page](/docs/apm/applications-menu/monitoring/external-services-page-view-web-cloud-network-data).

            This chart measures the performance of your app based on its [Apdex T value](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction) during the selected time window. To view additional details, hover over the question <Icon name="fe-help-circle"/>
            icon or the chart's **End user** and **App server** lines. The **End user** line charts the Apdex for your [browser](/docs/browser) apps, and the **App server** line charts the Apdex for your APM apps.

    If you [install the browser agent via an APM agent](/docs/browser/browser-monitoring/installation/install-browser-monitoring-agent/), you can automatically link the browser-monitored app to the APM-monitored app.

    Once the browser agent is set up, the APM **Summary** page provides summary information and direct links to detailed information on the app's corresponding [browser **summary** page](/docs/new-relic-browser/browser-overview).

    * To view chart details with browser [page load time](/docs/new-relic-browser/page-load-timing-process), select the main chart's **Browser** link.
    * To view the Apdex score for browsers, select the Apdex chart's **Browser** link.

## Link app performance to resources [#infra-server]

The APM **Summary** page shows a table with averages about your app's instances on their [hosts](/docs/accounts-partnerships/accounts/account-billing-usage/compute-unit-pricing-host-pricing#understand), including:

* Apdex
* Response time
* Throughput
* Error rate
* CPU usage
* Memory

<Callout variant="tip">
  CPU usage percentage is calculated as though the application is running on one CPU core. For more information about this calculation, see [CPU usage is over 100%](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/troubleshooting/cpu-usage-over-100#h2-apps).
</Callout>

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="host-performance"
    title="Examine app performance within system context"
  >
    Use any of these options to examine your app's performance within the context of your system's architecture and resources, such as individual hosts:

    * Select your choice from the table at the bottom of the APM **Summary** page for [infrastructure](#hosts_details).
    * Toggle between a table view or breakout metric details. <img title="APM Overview: table-hosts toggle" alt="APM Overview: table-hosts toggle" src={apmOverviewServers}/>
    * If applicable, select your choice from the drop-down at the top of the APM **Summary** page for servers or JVMs.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="host_details"
    title="Examine details within infrastructure"
  >
    To help you understand the full context of your app's performance within your environment, APM includes options to view performance from inside the application, as well as from outside the application with the [infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/getting-started/welcome-new-relic-infrastructure) agent.

    To view detailed information from your resources' point of view, click any host link. The link takes you directly to the infrastructure [**Compute** page](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/infrastructure-ui-pages/infrastructure-compute-page-measure-resource-usage).

    <img
      title="APM Overview: Hosts link"
      alt="APM: Infrastructure link"
      src={apmOverviewofHosts}
    />

    When you click, the **Compute** data may not immediately appear. If that happens, follow the prompt to validate your account and complete the conversion process for the infrastructure agent. If you need additional help, get support at [**support.newrelic.com**](https://support.newrelic.com).

          <td>
            Your infrastructure agent is not installed on the host.

            Follow standard procedures to [install our infrastructure agent](/docs/infrastructure/new-relic-infrastructure/installation).

        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>

          <td>
            Set the hostname for the container to be the hostname of the underlying server.

            Docker containers: Run your Docker container with the argument:

            ```
            --uts="host"
            ```

            This will cause the container to share the UTS Linux Namespace with the underlying host. However, by using this set, a privileged container could change the host's hostname.

          <td>
            To get a direct link to infrastructure metric data for your application, [enable process metrics](/docs/infrastructure/install-configure-manage-infrastructure/configuration/infrastructure-configuration-settings#enable-process-metrics) in the infrastructure agent's configuration.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Your infrastructure agent is installed, but it only reports the short hostname, not the long hostname.
          </td>

          <td>
            Configure your server's hostname settings so that the infrastructure agent and the APM agent return the exact same name string. If possible, do so by editing your server's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) settings.

            The APM and infrastructure agents both read their hostname from the operating system's FQDN settings, so setting the hostname there ensures both agents share a single hostname. For more information, see the [Java agent troubleshooting example](/docs/agents/java-agent/troubleshooting/setting-hostname-reported-java-agent).
