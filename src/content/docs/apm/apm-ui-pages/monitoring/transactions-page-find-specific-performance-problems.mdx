APM's **Transactions** page helps you identify [transactions](/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/transactions-new-relic-apm) that may be good candidates for fine-tuning performance problems or resolving errors. This page lists the selected app's transaction **Requests**, the top five transactions by percent of [wall-clock time](#wall_clock_time), and relevant [throughputs](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#throughput) (requests per minute or **rpm**).

For [non-web transactions](/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/monitor-background-processes-other-non-web-transactions) (such as message processing, background tasks, and other processes and jobs that do not handle web requests), this page shows charts of CPU and memory usage.

## Types of transactions [#tx_types]

<Callout variant="tip">
  To get a high-level overview of all your applications and services, use the [New Relic Explorer](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/ui-data/new-relic-one-entity-explorer).
</Callout>

Depending on your selected application, the **Transactions** page may include a dropdown you can use to select from the [types of transactions available](#txn-type-dropdown). New Relic measures [processing time](/docs/apm/applications-menu/features/request-queuing-tracking-front-end-time) by type of request ([web transaction](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#transaction) or [non-web transaction](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#non-web-transaction)). This may include:

* **Web:** App server requests
* **Non-web:** Other requests (operations, background tasks, etc.)

The **Transactions** page also may include links to [transaction traces](/docs/apm/transactions/transaction-traces/introduction-transaction-traces) and [key transactions](/docs/apm/transactions/key-transactions/introduction-key-transactions). The types of information available will depend on your selected app and the type of request (web or non-web).

## Wall-clock time [#wall_clock_time]

Wall-clock time is the amount of time recorded by the clock. New Relic uses wall-clock time for all the transactions and then sums that value across all of the transactions.

The host can execute requests in parallel, so you may see percentages over 100. For example, 100% would indicate that the execution time across all selected transactions is equal to the time expended when recording wall-clock time.

## View transactions [#tx_viewing]

To view information about your app's transaction requests:

1. Do one of the following:
   * Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & services > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions**.
   * Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Explorer > (select an app) > Monitor > Transactions**.
2. If applicable: To change which available [types](#tx_types) of transactions appear, select the **Type**.
3. Select the [sort order](#sort-definitions), or keep the default.
4. Select the [type of view](/docs/using-new-relic/user-interface-functions/view-your-data/select-chart-views) as a chart (default), histogram, or percentile, if available.
5. To view additional details, use any of the transaction [drill-down functions](#tx_functions).
6. To add a chart to a dashboard, mouse over the chart, then select the **Add to a dashboard** link that appears below it.

If a chart's background is light red, this indicates a time period when an alert condition's [**Critical** threshold](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/defining-conditions/define-thresholds-trigger-alert) has been violated. To view the [incident details](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/reviewing-alert-incidents/view-violation-event-details-incidents) in [alerts](/docs/alerts/new-relic-alerts/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-alerts), click the chart.

For more information, see the documentation about [navigating core UI components](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/new-relic-one-core-ui-components).

## Use drill-down functions [#tx_functions]

Use any of New Relic's standard [user interface functions](/docs/using-new-relic/user-interface-functions/view-your-data/standard-page-functions) to drill down into detailed information. The **Transactions** page has additional drill-down functions.

<CollapserGroup>

    <img
      title="trx-type-dropdown.png"
      alt="Screenshot showing the dropdown that allows you to choose other transaction types."
      src={apmDropdown}
    />

    If the **Type** dropdown appears above list of transactions, you can select your choice of transaction type. The available types depend on what transactions your application uses.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="sort-definitions"
    title="Select the type of performance measurement (Sort)"
  >
    The **Sort** dropdown above the transaction list allows you to review transactions according to different measurements. This helps you identify good candidates for performance tuning or fixing errors.

    You can sort by:

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
            **Sort option**
          </th>

          <th>
            **Comments**
          </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            Most time consuming (default)
          </td>

          <td>
            Highest percentage of the app's total time used.

            This measures which transactions consumed the most time in total. This is calculated by multiplying the number of times the transaction is called by the time the transaction took to complete. A transaction could be short, but if it is frequently called, it would appear at the top of this ranking.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Slowest average response time
          </td>

          <td>
            Slowest individual transactions for the time period as averaged.

            This measures the slowest types of transaction. A transaction could be called only a few times, but if it is one of the longest transactions to finish, it would appear at the top of this ranking.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Apdex most dissatisfying
          </td>

          <td>
            Transactions with the highest percentages of user dissatisfaction levels for the response time of your web apps and services ([Apdex](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction)).

            The [dissatisfaction level](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/view-your-apdex-score#apdex-dissat) is the difference between a perfect Apdex score (1.0) and your app's `apdex_t` ("tolerating") score, based on your [Apdex settings](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/change-your-apdex-settings). Transactions that have the highest (worst) percentages appear at the top of this ranking.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Highest throughput
          </td>

          <td>
            This measures the amount of [throughput](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#throughput), in operation requests per minute or **rpm**. (For web throughput, requests per minute is sometimes called pages per minute or **ppm**.) Transactions that have the highest number of requests per minute appear at the top of this ranking.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
