The entity recommendations center for APM provides a list of actions you can take to improve your observability for the selected app or service. These recommendations help you understand where you may have blind spots in instrumentation or alert coverage that could be increasing your mean time to detect (MTTD) or mean time to resolve (MTTR) when performance incidents occur.

Here are just a few of the areas the recommendation center analyzes for your APM app or service:

*  Its relationships and dependencies to other services and infrastructure
*  The alerts you've configured
*  Settings on your New Relic agent

Based on all of this contextual information, the recommendation center displays a list of gaps it finds and the simple actions you can take to close them.

To reach the recommendations center, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities)  > APM & Services > (select an app)**. Select **Recommendations** in the left navigation pane.

We’re adding more recommendations all the time! If you have any suggestions for more or feedback about the recommendations we already display, please let us know by clicking the speech bubble icon at the top of the page when you’re logged in to New Relic and leave us a comment!
