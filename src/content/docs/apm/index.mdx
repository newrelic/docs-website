    Your Dev/Ops teams need to know why a performance blocker comes from the application itself, CPU availability, database loads, or something else entirely unexpected. You also need to optimize app performance wherever possible.

    With New Relic's [Application Performance Monitoring (APM)](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/introduction-new-relic-apm), you have real-time and trending data about performance for your [web apps](/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/transactions-new-relic-apm) and [processes (non-web apps)](/docs/apm/transactions/intro-transactions/monitor-background-processes-other-non-web-transactions). In addition, with [New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one), you can correlate your app's related services, alerts, logs, your infrastructure, and your corresponding mobile app experience.

    Don't just monitor your data to get details about what's happening at a particular point of time. Instead, use the collective power of New Relic One to understand what to do with your detailed data, across your entire stack.
