APM's **Alerts** page shows a table of alerts over the past two weeks that you can drill down into detailed information, including throughput, error rate percentage, and history. You can view alert history for a specific application or for all applications.

## Alerts for specific apps [#alert_procedures]

To view a list of alerts for a specific app: Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > APM & Services > (select an app) > Events > Issues & activity**.

The **Issues & Activity** page shows a list of issues, incidents, anomalies and postmortems, if any. Use any of New Relic's standard [UI features](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/introduction-new-relic-platform) to drill down for more detail. 

Each alert notification includes the alert icon and summary information. To view details about an alert notification on the alerts page, select its link. For example:

* To view details about a specific alert, select its name.
* To narrow the list of alerts, use the **Filter**.
* To view all alerts for all of your apps and hosts, select the **All alerts** link.
* To select a specific Java Virtual Machine (JVM) if applicable, select your choice from the **JVMs** menu.
