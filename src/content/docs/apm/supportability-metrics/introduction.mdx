APM supportability metrics help you understand how your New Relic agents are performing and identify potential issues with your application monitoring. These metrics provide valuable insights into agent behavior, feature adoption, and configuration effectiveness across all supported programming languages.

<Callout variant="important">
  You're charged for supportability metric ingest as part of your New Relic data consumption. These metrics provide valuable troubleshooting and optimization information that can help you resolve issues faster and improve application performance.

## What are supportability metrics? [#what-are-supportability-metrics]

Supportability metrics are specialized metrics that APM agents automatically collect about their own operation. They help you:

* **Troubleshoot monitoring issues**: Identify why certain data isn't appearing in your dashboards
* **Validate configuration**: Confirm that features like distributed tracing or logging are working correctly
* **Monitor agent performance**: Track resource usage and identify potential bottlenecks
* **Optimize feature usage**: Understand which agent features your application is using most
* **Track agent health**: Monitor connection status and data transmission success rates

All supportability metrics use the `Supportability/` prefix in their metric names, making them easy to identify and query with [NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/).

## Common supportability metric categories [#metric-categories]

While each APM agent has unique supportability metrics, most agents share these common categories:

### Distributed tracing metrics
Monitor the health and performance of distributed tracing across your services. These metrics help identify configuration issues and connectivity problems between instrumented applications.

**Example metrics:**
* `Supportability/DistributedTrace/CreatePayload/Success`
* `Supportability/TraceContext/Accept/Success`
* `Supportability/TraceContext/Accept/Exception`

### Agent collector communication
Track communication between your agents and New Relic's data collection service. Monitor connection success rates, data transmission volumes, and potential bottlenecks.

**Example metrics:**
* `Supportability/Agent/Collector/connect/Success`
* `Supportability/Agent/Collector/DataSent`
* `Supportability/EventHarvest/HarvestLimitReached`

### Application logging metrics
Monitor the performance and configuration of New Relic's application logging features, including log forwarding and local decoration.

**Example metrics:**
* `Supportability/Logging/Forwarding/Sent`
* `Supportability/Logging/LocalDecorating/enabled`

### Performance and instrumentation metrics
Understand agent overhead, instrumentation effectiveness, and runtime performance impact.

**Example metrics:**
* `Supportability/AgentTiming/*` (various timing measurements)
* `Supportability/Library/*` (instrumented library tracking)

### Environment and configuration metrics
Gather information about your runtime environment, agent version, and configuration details.

**Example metrics:**
* `Supportability/AgentVersion/*`
* `Supportability/utilization/*` (cloud platform detection)

## Querying supportability metrics [#querying-metrics]

Use NRQL to analyze your supportability metrics. Here are some useful query patterns:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="query-all-supportability"
    title="List all supportability metrics for your account"
  >
    ```sql
    SELECT uniques(metricName)
    FROM Metric
    WHERE metricName LIKE 'Supportability/%'
    SINCE 1 day ago
    LIMIT MAX
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="query-agent-health"
    title="Monitor overall agent health"
  >
    ```sql
    SELECT
      count(*) as 'Total Metrics',
      uniqueCount(appName) as 'Apps Reporting',
      uniqueCount(host) as 'Hosts Reporting'
    FROM Metric
    WHERE metricName LIKE 'Supportability/%'
    SINCE 1 hour ago
    TIMESERIES
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="query-by-agent-type"
    title="Group metrics by agent type"
  >
    ```sql
    SELECT
      count(*) as 'Metric Count',
      appName,
      capture(metricName, r'Supportability/([^/]+)') as 'Metric Category'
    FROM Metric
    WHERE metricName LIKE 'Supportability/%'
    SINCE 1 hour ago
    FACET appName, `Metric Category`
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Agent-specific documentation [#agent-specific]

Each APM agent generates unique supportability metrics based on its language, framework integrations, and specific features. For detailed information about metrics for your programming language:

## Troubleshooting with supportability metrics [#troubleshooting]

### Common troubleshooting scenarios

| Problem | What to check | Key metrics to monitor |
|---------|---------------|------------------------|
| **Missing transaction data** | Data harvest and transmission | `TotalEventsSeen` vs `TotalEventsSent` |
| **Distributed traces not connecting** | Trace context creation and acceptance | `TraceContext/Create/Success`, `Accept/Success` |
| **High agent overhead** | Performance timing metrics | `AgentTiming/*` metrics |
| **Configuration issues** | Agent connection and feature enablement | `Agent/Collector/connect/*` metrics |
| **Log data not appearing** | Logging feature health | `Logging/Forwarding/*` metrics |

### Creating effective dashboards

Build custom dashboards to monitor your agent health:

1. **Agent Health Overview**: Connection success rates, data transmission volumes
2. **Performance Impact**: Agent timing metrics, resource usage
3. **Feature Adoption**: API usage metrics, feature-specific counters
4. **Data Quality**: Compare data seen vs. sent across different event types

### Setting up alerts

Monitor critical supportability metrics with [NRQL alert conditions](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions/):

* **Data loss detection**: Alert when events seen significantly exceed events sent
* **Connection problems**: Alert on repeated collector connection failures
* **Performance degradation**: Alert on high agent timing values
* **Configuration drift**: Alert when expected metrics stop reporting

## Data retention and costs [#retention-costs]

Supportability metrics follow the same [data retention rules](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/get-data-new-relic/manage-data/manage-retention-stored-data) as other metric data in your New Relic account. Consider:

* **Volume**: Each agent reports dozens of supportability metrics
* **Frequency**: Most metrics report every harvest cycle (typically 60 seconds)
* **Cost optimization**: Use targeted querying and alerting to focus on the most valuable metrics
* **Retention**: Standard metric retention applies (varies by subscription level)
