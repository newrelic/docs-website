Node.js agent supportability metrics help you understand how your Node.js agent is performing and identify potential issues with your application monitoring. These metrics provide valuable insights into agent behavior, feature adoption, and configuration effectiveness.

## Coming soon

Detailed Node.js agent supportability metrics documentation is being developed. This will include:

* **Distributed tracing metrics** - Monitor trace context creation and acceptance
* **Agent collector communication** - Track data transmission and connection health
* **Application logging metrics** - Monitor log forwarding and decoration features
* **Performance metrics** - Understand agent overhead and timing
* **Environment metrics** - Runtime and configuration information
* **API usage metrics** - Track New Relic Node.js agent API usage

## General supportability metrics information

While this specific documentation is in development, you can:

* Review the [general supportability metrics introduction](/docs/apm/supportability-metrics/introduction) for concepts that apply to all agents
* Use [NRQL queries](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language) to explore existing Node.js agent supportability metrics:

```sql
SELECT uniques(metricName)
FROM Metric
WHERE metricName LIKE 'Supportability/%'
AND appName LIKE '%your-nodejs-app%'
SINCE 1 day ago
LIMIT MAX
```

## Next steps

* Learn more about [Node.js agent configuration](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/installation-configuration/nodejs-agent-configuration)
* Explore [Node.js agent troubleshooting guides](/docs/apm/agents/nodejs-agent/troubleshooting)
* Set up [custom dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) to visualize your metrics
