You can decide to switch data monitoring products for a variety of reasons. Maybe you've read an article or watched a video about a feature unique to New Relic that sparked your interest. Maybe you want to take a more comprehensive approach to your data while having the ability to identify issues as they arise from your monitored services. Or maybe you just want to try something new and see how it works for your organization. 

Whatever the reason, you can try New Relic without needing to fully migrate from Datadog. You'll get full access to all of our tools for whatever fits best for your team. Best of all, you can try [for free](https://newrelic.com/signup).

## Understanding entities [#entities]

At New Relic, we base observability around the concept of entities. Essentially, anything that reports data to or contains data for New Relic that can be identified with a unique ID is an entity. We use a powerful mapping system to better link entities to work together and give you the ability to monitor virtually any data that you bring in to our system. All this to let you see exactly the data your care about at any level, without cluttering up your monitoring with things you don't want or need.

We've provided a series of tutorials to help you get started monitoring entities with New Relic. Below, you'll find information on setting up monitoring for infrastructure, applications, and logs, as well as dashboards and alerts to help you really control your data. 

The only prerequesite is a New Relic account: [sign-up for free](https://newrelic.com/signup) and you're ready to get started!
