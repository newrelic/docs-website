Intro - Why you should migrate APM monitoring from NR to DD. 

* NR is app integration centric, documentation should reflect this, list strengths from marketing and existing doc. 
* New Relic has a robust monitoring system through apps, but setting up infrastructure gives you insight into (infra stuff)
* Quick bullet list of capabilities and strengths of app monitoring (no "sales" language or tone)
* Can probably borrow from Bradley's work with the APM intro, as well as some existing documentation
* Add an alert and a dashboard using the quickstart guides
