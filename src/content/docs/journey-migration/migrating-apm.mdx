While setting up infrastructure monitoring provides a great foundation for understanding your systems, the best way to truly know your data comes from monitoring application performance. New Relic APM provides extensive, unified monitoring for all your applications. 

That means we can better link your data through your apps and integrations, and provide more focused information for you through curated dashboards. That way, you get the level of depth and detail you need without having to hunt for what you want. And you can try out our extensive APM capabilities [absolutely free](https://newrelic.com/signup).

## Your APM solution [#apm-solution]

You may be used to `integrations` in Datadog, but in New Relic, we call these capabilities APM `agents`. We've set up our agents for both convenience and functionality. At New Relic, our agents are focused around language and linking the data they collect to other entities you've installed. 

For example, an installed Java agent will collect metrics about your Java app (as well as your logs, events, and traces), and links together with an installed Ruby agent which does the same for Ruby. They link up with your infrastructure agents to provide a comprehensive, real-time view of all the data across your entire system, no matter the source.  Our agents let you:

* Monitor the performance and health of your apps in one central location.
* User New Relic with open source tools such as OpenTelemetry.
* Automatically instrument metrics, events, and traces.
* Ingest your logs automatically.
* Manage service security without prior configuration.

## Get started with New Relic APM monitoring [#get-started]

Once the setup is complete, your APM data in New Relic is found in the **APM and services** section of the UI, which is the equivalent of the **APM** section in Datadog. You can follow a guided install for most of our agents at any time within [**one.newrelic.com**](https://one.newrelic.com) by selecting **one.newrelic.com > Add Data > All > Guided install**, then selecting your agent from the **APM (Application Monitoring)** section.

You can also install our APM agents directly by using any of the tiles below. Our guided installs walk you through the setup procedures for any of our APM agents so that you can observe your data right away. All you need is a [free account](https://newrelic.com/signup) and an application to monitor and you're ready to begin!

## Explore premade dashboards [#add-dashboard]

Like with our infrastructure monitors, we give you access to out-of-the-box dashboards immediately upon setting up your APM integration. These dashboards are also pre-configured, giving you depth of information on a wide variety of data points. 
<img
    title="Premade alerts"
    alt="An image displaying some of New Relic's premade APM alerts"
    src={journeyAPMDash2}

Some of the most important areas that our APM dashboards automatically cover are:
* Details on your core web vitals, across any time range you need on the **Summary** page.
* Data on any incidents, vulnerabilities, error rates on deploymants, and information on the health of your entire stack from the same **Summary** page. 
* A **Recommendations** page that gives you insight on how to fix errors and improve the health of your stack.
* A **Triage** section providing access to errors, logs, and vulnerability management with a single click.
* Event data as detailed as you want it from the **Events** section, with information on issues, deployments, and a thread profiler.
* A host of reports for SLA, service levels, scalability, capacity, and performance from the **Reports** section.  

## Add preconfigured alerts [#alerts]

Go to **one.newrelic.com > Add Data > Application monitoring**, then select the **Alerts** tab. Just like with infrastructure, you'll see a [list of preset alerts](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace?state=fe696742-816d-5cc7-94d8-b7b453ef3161) to choose from. Once you add one to your account, you can customize the conditions to whatever you need them to be. Just select the option you want, add your account, plug-in your data with our guided install, and you'll be set! For more information on setting up premade alerts, see our [documentation on adding dashboards and alerts](/docs/journey-migration/migrating-dashboards/).
