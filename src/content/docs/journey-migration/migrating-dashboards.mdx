Setting up monitors for your data is the foundation of observability, but it's only half of the equation. You need to be able to visualize your data, group streams together, and be notified when your system runs into issues that negatively affect your users. You need to be able to do all this from a centralized location, and be able to adapt to the changing data needs of your organization by curating new visualizations on-the-fly. 

Where New Relic entities can give you scores of data to observe, our dashboards and alerts come in to help you make the most of it. You can use our pre-configured options to setup solutions out of the box, or use [NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language/), New Relic's Query Language, to create custom dashboard components and alert policies that are as fine-tuned to your requirements as you need want them to be. And like all our other features, you can try out dashboards and alerts using your own data [for free](https://newrelic.com/signup).

## Your dashboarding solution [#dashboard-solutions]

Our dashboards take the data you put into New Relic and provide you with a wide array of visualizations to suit your needs. You can make them as wide-viewed or as detailed as you like, and use them to troubleshoot issues before they become problems. Our dashboards give you:

* Analysis into your system, letting you correlate issues and act on them fast.
* In-depth views of your network, infrastructure, applications, logs, and anything else you need.
* Eliminate data silos and view your entire stack at a glance. 
* Report on custom information from virtually any data source.

## Your alerting solution [#alerts-solutions]

Being able to see your data is great, but being able to act on it to correct or prevent errors is even better! New Relic gives you multiple ways to customize alerts for your unique requirements while helping to eliminate alert fatigue. We offer proactive awareness for your problems, utilizing machine learning and applied intelligence to enhance our policies. Our alerts:

* Give you both preconfigured and from scratch creation options.
* Constantly detect the anomalies you care about the most. 
* Notify the right people at the right time, eliminating confusion in dealing with issues.
* Prioritize alert importance, reducing clutter and helping you keep track of what's really important.

## Create dashboards and alerts [#create-dash-and-alerts]

New Relic offers premade dashboards and alerts for all your agents, made by both New Relic itself and the community. Once they're set up, they're in either the **Dashboards** or **Alerts** sections, the same place that you're used to finding them in Datadog. 

You can set up dashboards and alerts one of two ways, either by creating one from scratch, or using one of our premade options as a base and modifying them as needed. Below, we'll show you how to setup a premade option for each, as well as where you can go to create them from scratch!

            <Step>
            Go to **Add Data**, then select the feature you want to create a dashboard for. For our example, we'll choose **Browser & mobile**, and create a dashboard to monitor our core web vitals.  
            </Step>
            <Step>
            Select the **Core Web Vitals Quickstart** option under **Dashboards** to open the guided install window.
            </Step>
            <Step>
            Select the account you want to add the dashboard to from the drop-down.
            </Step>
            <Step>
            Ensure you have the data stream setup already. In this case, Browser monitoring would need to be setup. If you hadn't set up, you'd select the Setup option, and if you had, you'd select **Done**.
            </Step>
            <Step>
            New Relic creates the dashboard, and you can select **View dashboard** to go to it right away and begin visualizing your data stream.
            </Step>
        </Steps>

            Go to **Add Data**, then select the feature you want to create a dashboard for. For our example, we'll choose **Application monitoring**, and create an alert to notify of us issues with a Ruby app.  
            </Step>
            <Step>
            Select the **Ruby alert policy** option under **Alerts** to open the guided install window.
            </Step>
            <Step>
            Select the account you want to add the alert to from the drop-down.
            </Step>
            <Step>
            Ensure you have the application setup already. In this case, Ruby would need to be setup. If you hadn't set up, you'd select the **Setup** option, and if you had, you'd select **Done**.
            </Step>
            <Step>
            New Relic creates the alert for you, and you can select **View alert policy** to go to it right away and see if it catches any anomalies in your app.
