[Comet](https://www.comet.ml/site/) is an [MLOps](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/mlops/get-started/intro-mlops/) platform that extends full stack observability to machine learning models, and allows you to establish production performance baselines based on model performance. The Comet integration allows you to integrate machine learning metrics with New Relic, so you can continuosly monitor your data across the full machine learning lifecycle. This helps ensure optimal model performance, and helps you achieve better business outcomes. 

## Integrate Comet with New Relic [#integrate-comet] 

Use New Relic's Comet integration to get data and insights that help you build better, more accurate machine-learning models, while also improving productivity, collaboration, and visibility across your team.

To setup the integration, follow these steps:

1. **Log into your New Relic account**: Log into **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)** and click on **Explorer**. In the upper hand corner, on the main navigation menu, click **+Add more data**.

2. **Click on Comet**: Type **Comet** in the search bar, or scroll down to the MLOps Integration section and click on the **Comet** icon.  

3. **Select the account ID** you want Comet to integrate with.

4. **Select or create an API key**: To integrate with Comet, you need a [New Relic license key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-license-key). Create or select an existing API key under the **Real time training metric** section.

5. **Contact Comet**: For the next step to set up the integration and view the Model Production Monitoring dashboard in Comet, you'll need to [contact Comet](mailto:sales@comet.ml). The Comet team will walk you through each step of the integration process and get you all set up.

6. **View your insights**: Now that you’ve set up your integration, you can start tracking the performance of your machine learning models in a dedicated [New Relic One dashboard](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/), which is automatically generated by Comet’s team.
