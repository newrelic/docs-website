With the GPT series application integration, users have the ability to seamlessly monitor OpenAI completion queries and simultaneously log useful statistics in a New Relic customizable dashboard.

By adding just two lines of code, users can gain access to key performance metrics such as cost, response time, and sample inputs/outputs. The dashboard also allows users to track total requests, average token/requests, and model names.

With the fully customizable dashboard of New Relic, users can add additional metrics based on their specific business requirements and needs.

Overall, New Relic's GPT integration provides real-time metrics to help businesses optimize usage, reduce costs, and achieve better results.

## Installation [#installation]

Installation is straightforward and similar to any Python library.

```python
pip install nr-openai-observability
```

## Getting Started [#getting-started]

This guide takes you step by step for everything needed to integrate OpenAI GPT applications and start monitoring your usage.

### Step 1. Set your environment variable [#set-environment-variable]

Get your `<InlinePopover type="licenseKey" />` (also referenced as `ingest - license`) and set it as environment variable: `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY`. [Click here](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#license-key) for more details and instructions.

```python
import os
os.environ["NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY"] = "<license key>"
```

`NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY` can also be sent as a parameter at the `monitor.initialization()` call.


### Step 2. Modify your code [#modify-code]

Add the following two lines to your code:

```python
from nr_openai_observability import monitor
monitor.initialization()
```

### Step 3. Add your dashboard [#add-dashboard]

Follow the instruction to add the dashboard to your New Relic account:

```python
import os

import openai
from nr_openai_observability import monitor

monitor.initialization()

openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
openai.Completion.create(
    model="text-davinci-003",
    prompt="What is Observability?",
    max_tokens=20,
    temperature=0 
)
```

## EU account users [#EU-account-users]

Are you reporting data to the New Relic EU region? Click [here](#EU-account-users) for more instructions. If you're using an EU account, you should also set your `EVENT_CLIENT_HOST`:

```python
import os
os.environ["EVENT_CLIENT_HOST"] = "insights-collector.eu01.nr-data.net"
```

`EVENT_CLIENT_HOST` can also be sent as a parameter at the `monitor.initialization()` call.
