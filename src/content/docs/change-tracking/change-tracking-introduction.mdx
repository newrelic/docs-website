    Change tracking is a way for you to record deployment and other changes across your CI/CD toolchain on any entity in your system. You can visualize the changes as markers on charts for APM, browser, mobile, and custom dashboards.

    The UI provides details about each of the changes you track, such as errors, log attributes, issues, and anomalies. These details can help you understand the impact of changes on system performance and quality.

    If you want to become acquainted with various aspects of the feature, check out our [feature overview](#feature-overview) below, or look at the [different ways to start tracking changes](#start-tracking).

## Review the features [#feature-overview]

Here are some highlights showing what you can do with change tracking:

* **Where to see changes:** Changes, such as deployments, are anchor points throughout your New Relic experience. They are markers of significant change within the context of your application telemetry, logs, errors, incidents, and other health and performance indicators. Once you start recording deployments, you will see them drawn on charts in APM, mobile, browser, dashboards, and elsewhere. You can also access them via the **Deployments** option on an entity's sidebar. Recording changes using New Relic APIs or integrations (for example, the Jenkins plugin) unlocks powerful interfaces that help you analyze the impact of change. Read more about the change tracking experience in [How to view and analyze your changes in New Relic](/docs/change-tracking/change-tracking-view-analyze).

* **How to query deployment changes:** Every change recorded by New Relic is stored in the New Relic database (NRDB), and you can query it using NRQL and NerdGraph. We'll show you example queries and information about where to look for data about the changes you're tracking.

* **Change tracking deployment changes and New Relic entities:** Every change you track must be directly associated with one New Relic entity, and for now, you must establish this relationship when designate the change to track. You can learn more about New Relic entities in [Find and explore entities and entity data](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/#find).

* **Group changes:** You can relate multiple deployments or other changes to one another using the `groupID` attribute. This may be useful in scenarios where a single release or action deploys updates to multiple parts of a system represented by New Relic entities.

* **See related changes:** Deployments can also be indirectly related to one another via the entity relationships feature. You can automatically visualize deployment changes on different entities and see them together on charts and in lists across New Relic if their entities are related. For more on entity relationships, see this [NerdGraph tutorial](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-relationships-api-tutorial/).
