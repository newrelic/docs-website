<Callout variant="caution" title="Preview">
We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

This feature is currently provided as part of a preview pursuant to our [pre-release policies](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy/).
</Callout>


The Change Tracking capability lets you capture, visualize, and analyze changes across your applications and infrastructure. This feature is designed to help you understand how changes impact both your system and your customer.

* **Capture all changes impacting your system:** Send change events for any type of change, including deployments, feature flags changes, configuration changes, and business events. You can also create custom change events tailored to your specific requirements. Use the [`changeTrackingCreateEvent`](#change-tracking-event-mutation) NerdGraph mutation to easily send various types of change events.

* **Gain a comprehensive view to manage system-wide changes:** Seamlessly view and filter change events across all of your entities and accounts from one unified interface. Effortlessly identify changes by filtering by team, type, custom attributes, and any other criteria.

* **Quickly correlate changes with telemetry to accelerate root cause discovery:** Enhance your understanding of change impact by visualizing change events alongside your time-series data. To find the root cause faster, add a time-series query to display change events with relevant metrics, allowing for clear correlation.

* **Enrich your change events with comprehensive metadata:** Track all the necessary information about your changes using custom attributes, categories, and types. Tailor your change events to include all specifics needed for thorough system clarity.



## Access the Change Tracking page in New Relic [#access-change-tracking-page]

You can access the <DNT>Change Tracking</DNT> page in the following ways:

- [Change Tracking across all entities page](#change-tracking-across-all-entities)
- [Change Tracking page for entity-scoped view](#entity-scoped-view)


### Change Tracking across all entities page [#change-tracking-across-all-entities]

The <DNT>Change Tracking</DNT> across all entities page displays a consolidated view of change events for all accounts and entities on one page. It enables you to:

* Review changes across all accessible accounts and entities.
* Filter change events by account, entity, deployment type, and other attributes to refine results.
* Add a timeseries query to visualize change events against timeseries data across various entities and accounts.


**To access change tracking across all entities:**

Go to <DNT>[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)</DNT> > <DNT>**All Capabilities > Change Tracking**</DNT>.

<Callout variant="tip" title="TIP">
To add the <DNT>Change Tracking</DNT> page to your left navigation, click the pin icon.

    alt="Global view for change tracking"
    src="/images/globalView.webp"
/>


The <DNT>Change Tracking</DNT> across all entities page displays the change events for all entities and accounts for which you have access. You can view these events in the two components:

* **Change events table:** This table lists change events from your accessible accounts. Each event in the table is also marked on the time-series chart.
    * To refine the list, use the filter bar with event attributes and entity tags.
    * Adjust the displayed time range using the time picker, or by clicking and dragging a selection directly on the chart.

* **Change events time-series chart:** Run a <DNT>NRQL</DNT> query and view the results on this chart with change events overlaid. This visualization helps you correlate data trends (such as spikes or dips) with specific system changes across your accounts.

<Callout variant="tip" title="TIP">
The chart and table can each display a maximum of 1,000 events. If your current filters and time range result in more than 1,000 events, only the 1,000 most recent events are shown. To view a more specific set of events (fewer than 1,000), apply a more restrictive filter or select a shorter time range.

    </table> */}


### Change Tracking entity-scoped view [#entity-scoped-view]

The entity-scoped <DNT>Change Tracking</DNT> view displays change events for a specific entity, such as APM, browser, or mobile. It also offers additional information related to golden signals for each change event.

**To access the <DNT>Change Tracking</DNT> for entity-scoped view:**

1. Go to <DNT>[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)</DNT> > <DNT>**All Entities**</DNT>.
2. Select the required entity then click <DNT>**Change Tracking**</DNT>.

## Track changes using NerdGraph [#track-changes-nerdgraph]


The New Relic change tracking capability allows you to monitor the impact of various modifications on your systems. For instance, you can record a marketing campaign as a change event and then use the Change Tracking UI to analyze its effect on system performance through charts.

To record deployments and other types of change events, use the NerdGraph mutation `changeTrackingCreateEvent`. For more information about using NerdGraph, refer to [Introduction to NerdGraph](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/).


### Requirements [#requirements]

* [NerdGraph requirements](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/#authentication)
* All [types of New Relic users](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type) can use NerdGraph to create change events, but only full platform users can access the curated change tracking UI experiences.

### Change tracking event mutation [#change-tracking-event-mutation]

Use the <DNT>`changeTrackingCreateEvent`</DNT> mutation to create a change event by providing its required and optional attributes.

<Callout variant="important">
    Change events created using the `changeTrackingCreateEvent` mutation are not currently displayed in the APM Summary Deployments tile and the Transaction 360 feature during its public preview. These events are planned to appear in both upon GA.

          <td>String</td>

            A `category` attribute allows you to categorize changes using various `categories` and `types`. You can either use our predefined [standard categories and types](#supported-types) or define your own custom ones.

            * To use our [standard categories and types](#supported-types):
                * If you set `category` to `Deployment`:
                    * You must set the `categoryFields` attribute to `Deployment`.
                    * This `deployment` field must include a `version`.
                * If you set `category` to `Feature flag`:
                    * You must set the `categoryFields` attribute to `Feature flag`.
                    * This `featureFlag` field must include a `featureFlagId`.
            * To use Custom categories:
                * Within the `dataHandlingRules` attribute, set the `validationFlags` field to `ALLOW_CUSTOM_CATEGORY_OR_TYPE`.

        <tr>
          <td>`type`</td>
          <td> String </td>
          <td>
            The `type` attribute provides a further distinction for a change event, often used in conjunction with the `category`. For example, if an event's `category` is `Deployment`, its type might be `Rolling`.

            You can use a predefined standard `type` typically associated with a standard `category` or define a custom `type`.
            If you define a custom type, you must also:
                * Configure the `dataHandlingRules` attribute.
                * Set the `validationFlags` attribute to `ALLOW_CUSTOM_CATEGORY_OR_TYPE`.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>`version`</td>
          <td> String </td>
          <td> If the `category` attribute is set to `Deployment`, then within the `categoryFields` attribute, you must define a `deployment` field and ensure this `deployment` field includes a `version`.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>`featureFlagId`</td>
          <td>String</td>
          <td>If you select `Feature flag` as your category, under the `categoryFields` attribute, you must also select `featureFlag` and include a `featureFlagId`. This `id` can be any string you would like to identify your feature flag by.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>`dataHandlingRules`</td>
          <td>String</td>
          <td>
            When you define a custom `category`, `type`, or a non-standard combination of `category` and `type`, you must configure the `dataHandlingRules` attribute. This action is coupled with setting the `validationFlags` attribute to `ALLOW_CUSTOM_CATEGORY_OR_TYPE`.

            If `validationFlags` is not set to `ALLOW_CUSTOM_CATEGORY_OR_TYPE` when using such custom or non-standard values, New Relic will return an error if a `category` or `type` value does not exactly match a predefined standard value. For example, even if you use a standard `category` such as `Deployment`, pairing it with a `custom` type such as `Rainbow` which is not a New Relic standard combination requires you to set `validationFlags` to `ALLOW_CUSTOM_CATEGORY_OR_TYPE` and configure `dataHandlingRules`.

                <Callout variant="tip">
                    When `validationFlags` is set to `ALLOW_CUSTOM_CATEGORY_OR_TYPE`, ensure that the string values you provide for your custom `category` or `type` attributes use the exact casing that you intend to see in the New Relic UI.

          <td>String</td>
          <td>

            The entity search query enables you to find a specific entity within New Relic. You can search by using its specific entity guid using the `id` field or by providing other identifying information if the entity guid is unknown. An entity guid is a unique identifier that New Relic assigns to your system components such as applications or microservices during their instrumentation or setup. For more information about entities, refer to [New Relic Entities](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/#what-is-entity).

            * Query specific entities: You can search for an exact or fuzzy matching on various attributes, including `id` and `name`, but your query must be specific enough to resolve to exactly one entity.

            * Supported operators: The `=`, `AND`, `IN`, and `LIKE` are supported operators for entity search queries.

            * Using special characters: Special characters such as `(`, `.` `,`, `;`, `:`, `*`,`-`, `_`, and `)` are treated as whitespace in the query string. For example, a query like `name LIKE ':aws:'` will match entity names containing `-aws` or `foo.aws`.
            * Tags: You can reference tags with or without backticks. You can filter entities based on default entity properties and tags.

                * Default entity properties:

                    * `id`

                    * `accountId`

                    * `name`

                    * `domainId`

                    * `alertSeverity`

                    * `reporting`

                    * `indexedAt`

                    * `firstIndexedAt`

                    * `lastReportingChangeAt`

                * Tags: Tags are metadata typically linked to a more specific domain type or group of domain types. For example:

                    * `language`: Specifies the agent language for APM applications

                    * `clusterAgentId`: For Browser applications, this tag links to the associated APM application's cluster agent.

                    * `aws.accountId`: The `AWS account ID` for infrastructure entities monitored from AWS.

                Examples:

                    * To find an entity by its entity guid: `"id = '<entity guid>'"`
                    * To find an entity using its REST v2 API application ID: `"domainId = '<app id>' AND domain = 'APM'"`
                    * To find an OpenTelemetry service in a specific account: `"name = '<service name>' AND domain = 'EXT' AND type = 'SERVICE' AND accountId = '<account id>'"`

## How to view and analyze your changes in New Relic [#view-analyze-changes]

The Detail page provides similar functionality for non-deployment changes as it does for deployment-type changes. For more information, refer [View and analyze your changes](/docs/change-tracking/change-tracking-view-analyze/).


## Query change events using NRQL [#query-change-events-nrql]

You can query change events using <DNT>NRQL</DNT> and NerdGraph to analyze and visualize changes. Here are some example queries you can use:
