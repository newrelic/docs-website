After setting up change tracking, you can analyze how deployments, feature flags, and other modifications impact your system performance. This page shows you how to access change tracking data, view changes across your system, and understand their impact on performance metrics.

For example, you can see app server Apdex scores, response times, throughput, and errors. You can view and drill down details, use search and sort options, hide or delete the error, share it with others, or file a ticket about it.


## Access change tracking [#access]

You can access change tracking data in New Relic through two main views, depending on your analysis needs.

- [Change Tracking across all entities page](#global-view)
- [Change Tracking page for entity-scoped view](#entity-view)

### Global view across all entities [#global-view]

The Change Tracking across all entities page displays a consolidated view of change events for all accounts and entities on one page. It enables you to:

* Review changes across all accessible accounts and entities.
* Filter change events by account, entity, deployment type, and other attributes to refine results.
* Add a timeseries query to visualize change events against timeseries data across various entities and accounts.

**To access the global view:**

Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All Capabilities > Change Tracking**.

<Callout variant="tip">
  To add the Change Tracking page to your left navigation, click the pin icon.
</Callout>


The Change Tracking across all entities page displays the change events for all entities and accounts for which you have access. You can view these events in the two components:

* **Change events table:** This table lists change events from your accessible accounts. Each event in the table is also marked on the time-series chart.

    * To refine the list, use the filter bar with event attributes and entity tags.
    * Adjust the displayed time range using the time picker, or by clicking and dragging a selection directly on the chart.

* **Change events time-series chart:** Run a NRQL query and view the results on this chart with change events overlaid. This visualization helps you correlate data trends (such as spikes or dips) with specific system changes across your accounts.

<Callout variant="tip">

  The chart and table can each display a maximum of 1,000 events. If your current filters and time range result in more than 1,000 events, only the 1,000 most recent events are shown. To view a more specific set of events (fewer than 1,000), apply a more restrictive filter or select a shorter time range.

</Callout>

### Entity-specific view [#entity-view]

The entity-scoped Change Tracking view displays change events for a specific entity, such as APM, browser, or mobile. It also offers additional information related to golden signals for each change event.


**To access entity-specific change tracking:**

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All Entities**
2. Select your required entity.
3. Click **Change tracking** in the left navigation.

  style={{ align: 'left', maxWidth: '100%' }}
  title="Entity-scoped view for change tracking"
  alt="Entity-scoped view showing change events with golden signals"
  src="/images/entityScopedView.webp"
/>

<Callout variant="tip">
  The entity view includes additional golden signal metrics and impact analysis specific to that entity type.
</Callout>


## View your changes [#view-changes]

Once you've set up change tracking, you can view change markers and events in several locations throughout New Relic.

### In charts and dashboards [#charts]

Change markers appear as vertical lines with pinheads on time-series charts across APM, browser, mobile, and custom dashboards. Click the pinhead to drill into the change's impact on entity health and performance.

<img
  style={{ align: 'left', maxWidth: '100%' }}
  title="Change marker in time series chart"
  alt="Screenshot showing a vertical line change marker in a time series chart"
  src="/images/tracking_screenshot-crop_deployment-in-timeseries-chart.webp"
/>

<Callout variant="tip">
  If you don't see expected markers, check your time picker selectionâ€”the change might be outside your current time window.
</Callout>


### How markers are selected for charts [#marker-selection]

Charts display markers based on the underlying NRQL query and related entities:

1. **Direct entity specification**: Charts show markers for entities explicitly mentioned in the query using `entity.guid`, `entityGuid`, `entity.name`, `entityName`, `appName`, or `service.name`
2. **Related entities**: Markers also appear for entities connected through these relationship types: `CALLS`, `SERVES`, `IS`, `CONTAINS`, `HOSTS`

<Callout variant="important">
  NRQL queries are scoped to a single account. Charts can display up to 5,000 change events.
</Callout>

## Analyze change impact [#analyze-impact]

New Relic provides several tools to help you understand how changes affect your system performance and user experience.


<CollapserGroup>

<Collapser
  id="change-details"
  title="In change details page"
>


Click any change marker or event to open the **Change details** page. It contains the data you sent when you recorded the change plus a wealth of information about its impact.

**Key impact insights:**

* **Net impact calculations**: See percentage changes in key metrics like throughput, error rate, and response time by comparing equal time periods before and after the change.
* **Faceted findings**: View related data from errors inbox, log monitoring, AIOps issues, incidents, and anomalies.
* **Entity relationships**: Links to related entities help you trace impact across your system.
* **Change metadata**: All submitted data from when the change was recorded.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Pay attention to the selected before/after time period. Adjust it using the time picker if it's too short or long for meaningful analysis.
</Callout>

<img
  title="Change details page"
  alt="Screenshot showing the change details page with impact metrics"
  src="/images/tracking_screenshot-crop_deployment-details.webp"
/>


</Collapser>

<Collapser
  id="comparison-periods"
  title="Adjust comparison periods"
>

Use the time picker in the top-right corner to change the before/after comparison period. This affects:

* Time-series charts and trend lines
* Net impact calculations and averages
* Data-driven insights throughout the page

<img
  style={{ align: 'left', maxWidth: '100%' }}
  title="Comparison window time picker"
  alt="Screenshot showing how to adjust the comparison time window"
  src="/images/tracking_screenshot-crop_comparison-window.webp"
/>

<Callout variant="important">
  The UI won't calculate net impacts if the elapsed time since the change is less than your selected period, as this would produce skewed results.
</Callout>

</Collapser>


<Collapser
  id="compare-changes"
  title="Compare changes"
>

Use the **compared with** dropdown next to the time picker to compare the current change with another recorded change. This enables:

* **Comparative charts**: Each time-series chart shows curves for both changes.
* **Relative performance analysis**: Compare metrics between two different changes.
* **Difference calculations**: See percentage increases/decreases between changes.
* **Stacked views**: Open up to five related changes for comprehensive comparison.

<img
  style={{ align: 'left', maxWidth: '100%' }}
  title="Change comparison dropdown"
  alt="Screenshot showing how to compare changes using the dropdown menu"
  src="/images/tracking_screenshot-crop_compare-deployments.webp"
/>

</Collapser>

<Collapser
  id="web-transactions"
  title="Web transaction analysis"
>

For APM applications, the **Web transaction impacts** section shows how up to ten of your most time-consuming web transactions were affected by the change.

<img
  style={{ align: 'left', maxWidth: '100%' }}
  title="Web transaction impacts"
  alt="Screenshot showing web transaction impact analysis"
  src="/images/tracking_screenshot-crop_impacts_to_web-transactions.webp"
/>

**Features:**

* **Metric selection**: Use the dropdown to view different performance metrics.
* **Time window awareness**: Results reflect your selected before/after period.
* **Comparative analysis**: Shows side-by-side comparison when comparing with another change.
* **Transaction details**: Hover over transaction names for performance summaries and links to detailed views.


</Collapser>


<Collapser
  id="custom-trend-boards"
  title="Custom trend boards"
>


You can create up to three custom trend boards for your changes to answer specific questions about your system's behavior. These boards let you:

* Select any metrics or events available to your entity.
* Apply aggregation functions such as `average`, `max`, `min`, `count`, etc.
* Integrate with the change details page time window and comparison settings.
* Export to dashboards for ongoing monitoring to a specific entity and to your user account.

<img
    title="Custom trend board example"
    alt="Screenshot showing a custom trend board on the change details page"
    src="/images/tracking_screenshot-crop_custom-charts-on-deployment-page.webp"
/>

To add a custom trend board:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/) > All Entities**</DNT> and select your entity.
2. Click <DNT>**Change tracking**</DNT> in the left navigation pane, and select a change.
3. Under the charts for <DNT>**Key impacts**</DNT>, click <DNT>**Add any metric or event**</DNT>.
4. Click <DNT>**What do you want to track**</DNT> and select a metric or event.
5. Click <DNT>**How do you want to aggregate that?**</DNT> and select a function.


**Example use cases:**

* How did average page view response time change?
* What was the maximum error rate before vs. after?
* How did database query performance trends shift?

## Data retention and limits [#data-limits]

Understanding data constraints helps you plan your analysis approach:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Data type</th>
      <th>Retention</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Change events</td>
      <td>13-month retention period</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Chart markers</td>
      <td>Up to 5,000 events per chart</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Change tracking tables</td>
      <td>2,000 events loaded by default</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Custom trend boards</td>
      <td>Maximum of 3 per change</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Comparison views</td>
      <td>Up to 5 stacked change comparisons</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
