The change tracking feature allows you to designate changes you want to monitor to see how they affect your customers and systems. While you can designate which changes you want to monitor by using GraphQL or our CLI, you can also record changes using pipelines in Jenkins.

A pipeline will call whatever build you specify and also pass additional environment variables to the build process. This populates the data that is needed for your deployment to show up in charts across New Relic. You'll see the results in the change tracking UIs, and you can use this information to understand the impact of changes on entity health.

## Prerequisites [#prereq]

To install the Jenkins plugin, you'll need:

* Jenkins 1.580.1 or newer
* Jenkins administrator privileges

## Install the Jenkins plugin [#install]

1. When you open Jenkins, go to <DNT>**Manage Jenkins**</DNT>, then <DNT>**Plugins**</DNT>.

   />

2. Click <DNT>**Available plugins**</DNT>, then search `newrelic-deployment-notifier`. Click <DNT>**Install**</DNT>.

     src="/images/tracking_screenshot-crop_jenkins-install-notifier.webp"
   />

3. A new page appears with  your installation's progress. No restart is needed for the plugin.

## Create Post-build Action [#create-post--build-action]

To add the New Relic Deployment Notifier as a Post-build Action in your Jenkins build job configuration:

1. In your Jenkins job configuration go to the <DNT>**Post-build Actions section**</DNT>, click on <DNT>**Add post-build action**</DNT>, then select <DNT>**New Relic Deployment Notifications**</DNT>.

  style={{ align: "left" }}
  title="Screenshot showing the Add post-build action button, with the dropdown menu showing New Relic Deployment Notifications"
  alt="Screenshot showing the Add post-build action button, with the dropdown menu showing New Relic Deployment Notifications"
  src="/images/tracking_screenshot-crop_jenkins--postbuild.webp"
/>

2. Create a username/password credential for the User [API key](/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/). Enter the key as the password.

   <img
     style={{ align: "left" }}
     title="Screenshot showing credential creation dialog"
     alt="Screenshot showing credential creation dialog"
     src="/images/tracking_screenshot-crop_jenkins--credential.webp"
   />

3. Select an entity in the dropdown list.

     title="Screenshot showing how to find Deployment Notifications"
     alt="Screenshot showing how to find Deployment Notifications"
     src="/images/tracking_screenshot-crop_jenkins--validcredential.webp"
   />

4. Add the required `Version` or `Revision` value, and any of the optional values. You can [use environment variables](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/#using-environment-variables) in these fields, like `${BUILD_NUMBER}`.

5. (Optional) If this Jenkins job affects multiple entities, they can be added to receive notifications as well. Click the <DNT>**Add another notification**</DNT> button to add more apps.

## What's next? [#whats-next]

After you've designated the changes you want to track, you can analyze the effect of those changes in the New Relic UI. For details, see [How to view and analyze your changes in New Relic](/docs/change-tracking/change-tracking-view-analyze).

## Remove the plugin [#remove-plugin]

1. From the <DNT>**Plugins**</DNT> page, click <DNT>**Installed plugins**</DNT>.
