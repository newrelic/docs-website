The change tracking feature allows you to track the effect of various changes on your customers and systems. For example, if you make some deployments, you can use the change tracking feature to monitor the results in New Relic UI charts. You'll also get access to features that help you understand the effects of those changes.

Instead of designating which changes you want to monitor by using our CLI or a CI/CD integration, you can do the same thing using GraphQL mutations and queries via our NerdGraph API.

For general information on using NerdGraph, see [Introduction to NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph).

## Prerequisites [#prerequisites]

* [NerdGraph requirements](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/#authentication)
* User permissions: Any [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type) can use NerdGraph to create change events and deployment markers, but only full platform users can access the curated change tracking UI experiences

Change tracking events provide comprehensive monitoring for any system modification including deployments, feature flags, business events, operational changes, and custom activities. This method offers flexible categorization, custom attributes, and unified cross-account visibility.


<Callout variant="important">
    Change events created using the `changeTrackingCreateEvent` mutation are not currently displayed in the APM Summary Deployments tile and the Transaction 360 feature during its public preview. These events are planned to appear in both upon GA.

            A `category` attribute allows you to categorize changes using various `categories` and `types`. You can either use our predefined [standard categories and types](#supported-types) or define your own custom ones.

            * To use our [standard categories and types](#supported-types):
                * If you set `category` to `Deployment`:
                    * You must set the `categoryFields` attribute to `Deployment`.
                    * This `deployment` field must include a `version`.
                * If you set `category` to `Feature flag`:
                    * You must set the `categoryFields` attribute to `Feature flag`.
                    * This `featureFlag` field must include a `featureFlagId`.
            * To use Custom categories:
                * Within the `dataHandlingRules` attribute, set the `validationFlags` field to `ALLOW_CUSTOM_CATEGORY_OR_TYPE`.
        </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>`type`</td>
          <td> String </td>
          <td>Yes</td>
          <td>
            The `type` attribute provides a further distinction for a change event, often used in conjunction with the `category`. For example, if an event's `category` is `Deployment`, its type might be `Rolling`.

            You can use a predefined standard `type` typically associated with a standard `category` or define a custom `type`.
            If you define a custom type, you must also:
                * Configure the `dataHandlingRules` attribute.
                * Set the `validationFlags` attribute to `ALLOW_CUSTOM_CATEGORY_OR_TYPE`.

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>`version`</td>
          <td> String </td>
          <td> Yes </td>
          <td> If the `category` attribute is set to `Deployment`, then within the `categoryFields` attribute, you must define a `deployment` field and ensure this `deployment` field includes a `version`.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>`featureFlagId`</td>
          <td>String</td>
          <td> Yes </td>
          <td>If you select `Feature flag` as your category, under the `categoryFields` attribute, you must also select `featureFlag` and include a `featureFlagId`. This `id` can be any string you would like to identify your feature flag by.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>`dataHandlingRules`</td>
          <td>String</td>
          <td> Yes </td>
          <td>
            To use a custom `category`, `type`, or a non-standard combination, set the `dataHandlingRules` attribute and the `validationFlags` attribute to `ALLOW_CUSTOM_CATEGORY_OR_TYPE`.

            If you do not set `validationFlags` to `ALLOW_CUSTOM_CATEGORY_OR_TYPE`, New Relic will return an error for any custom or non-standard value. For example, pairing a standard `category` like `Deployment` with a custom `type` such as `Rainbow` requires both attributes to be set.

            <Callout variant="tip">
              When using custom values, ensure your `category` and `type` strings use the exact casing you want to appear in the New Relic UI.

          <td>String</td>
          <td> Yes </td>
          <td>

            The entity search query enables you to find a specific entity within New Relic. You can search by using its specific entity guid using the `id` field or by providing other identifying information if the entity guid is unknown. An entity guid is a unique identifier that New Relic assigns to your system components such as applications or microservices during their instrumentation or setup. For more information about entities, refer to [New Relic Entities](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/#what-is-entity).

            * Query specific entities: You can search for an exact or fuzzy matching on various attributes, including `id` and `name`, but your query must be specific enough to resolve to exactly one entity.

            * Supported operators: The `=`, `AND`, `IN`, and `LIKE` are supported operators for entity search queries.

            * Using special characters: Special characters such as `(`, `.` `,`, `;`, `:`, `*`,`-`, `_`, and `)` are treated as whitespace in the query string. For example, a query like `name LIKE ':aws:'` will match entity names containing `-aws` or `foo.aws`.
            * Tags: You can reference tags with or without backticks. You can filter entities based on default entity properties and tags.

                * Default entity properties:

                    * `id`

                    * `accountId`

                    * `name`

                    * `domainId`

                    * `alertSeverity`

                    * `reporting`

                    * `indexedAt`

                    * `firstIndexedAt`

                    * `lastReportingChangeAt`

                * Tags: Tags are metadata typically linked to a more specific domain type or group of domain types. For example:

                    * `language`: Specifies the agent language for APM applications

                    * `clusterAgentId`: For Browser applications, this tag links to the associated APM application's cluster agent.

                    * `aws.accountId`: The `AWS account ID` for infrastructure entities monitored from AWS.

                Examples:

                    * To find an entity by its entity guid: `"id = '<entity guid>'"`
                    * To find an entity using its REST v2 API application ID: `"domainId = '<app id>' AND domain = 'APM'"`
                    * To find an OpenTelemetry service in a specific account: `"name = '<service name>' AND domain = 'EXT' AND type = 'SERVICE' AND accountId = '<account id>'"`

          A `groupId` attribute lets you organize the related changes across one or more entities. By using the same `groupId` for each related change, you can easily view these changes together in New Relic interfaces or refine query results. You can also use the same `groupId` to add changes to an existing group.

              New Relic recommends using the `groupId` attribute when making multiple updates to one or more entities or implementing various changes across your system.

          A short description for each change lets you identify the change events sent to New Relic quickly. If left blank, an autogenerated description is created that includes the entity, user, and version. The short description appears in the following areas:

            * In the **marker flag** as a tool tip, when you hover over a change marker on the chart.
            * In the **Activity stream** panels.

          <td>
            A `customAttributes` field is specified as `key-value` pairs in JavaScript object format, where values can be of `string`, `boolean`, or `number` types. JavaScript numbers are stored as Java `long` or `double` values. Unlike `.JSON`, keys in JavaScript objects are not quoted. To add a custom attribute, structure it as follows:

            ``` customAttributes: {key_name : "value_name"} ```
            </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>

Change tracking deployments provide specialized tracking for code deployments and infrastructure changes. This is the legacy method that focuses specifically on deployment events. You can create deployment markers using the `changeTrackingCreateDeployment` mutation.

<Callout variant="tip">
  New Relic recommends migrating to change tracking events using `changeTrackingCreateEvent` for better flexibility and feature support. Deployment markers will continue to work but have limited functionality compared to change events.

    To track a change, such as a deployment, you must set the following:

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
            Attribute
          </th>

          <th>
            Description
          </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            `entityGuid`
          </td>

          <td>
            The `entityGuid` value is the unique identifier assigned by New Relic to your system components during instrumentation and setup processes. For more information on New Relic Entities and finding Entity GUIDs, see this [guide](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/#find).
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            `version`
          </td>

          <td>
            The version attribute value can be anything, although we recommend using the version number set during your build process. To see an example of how this can be done, see our [Jenkins deployments plugin documentation](#jenkins-markers) below. If you already report version numbers to New Relic <InlinePopover type="mobile"/> or by some other means, we recommend using the same here to set yourself up for forthcoming features that will allow you to facet and correlate data by version.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <Callout variant="tip">
      If you are transitioning away from the legacy REST API, you'll need to start using your application's entity GUID instead of the appID. You can easily find the GUID in NerdGraph with this query:

      ```graphql
      {
        actor {
          entitySearch(query: "domainId=INSERT_YOUR_APPID") {
            count
            query
            results {
              entities {
                entityType
                name
                guid
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
      ```
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser

    You can define some optional and useful attributes to add context to the change you are tracking. These attributes can also enable certain change tracking features.

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
            Attribute
          </th>

          <th>
            Description
          </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>

      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            `changelog`
          </td>

          <td>
            You can submit a URL or any string for the changelog attribute. For example: `changelog: "Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None"` or `changelog: "https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v4.2.3/CHANGELOG.md"`.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            `description`
          </td>

          <td>
            You can submit any string for the description attribute. For example: `description: "Added a deployments resource to the v2 API"`.

            The description attribute may be where you choose to insert codified information from your internal deployment management processes. You can use IDs or tags you assign to each commit or deployment that describes organizational or business aspect of the work, for example, `EU_MAINT_DMARK_v101`.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            `commit`
          </td>

          <td>
            You can submit any string for the `commit` attribute, and we suggest using the commit SHA associated with the deployment or change, for example, `commit: "r3ws4sa43f"`.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            `deepLink`
          </td>

          <td>
            You can submit any URL for the `deepLink` attribute.  We suggest using one that will help someone evaluating a change on New Relic to quickly get to a place where they can take further action, such as Jenkins, ArgoCD, or GitHub Actions. Here's an example: `deepLink: "http://localhost:8080/job/PipelineV2/configure"`.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            `deploymentType`
          </td>

          <td>
            You can divide changes related to deployments into different types. These types align with common deployment techniques, but there is also an `OTHER` type. Types include:

            * `BASIC`
            * `BLUE_GREEN`
            * `CANARY`
            * `ROLLING`
            * `SHADOW`
            * `OTHER`

            Assigning a type to each deployment will help you filter results on change tracking interfaces and NerdGraph/NRQL query results.
          </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            `groupId`
          </td>

          <td>
            You may want to group deployments in cases where you're making a series of changes to one or more entities or releasing many changes across many entities within your system. By setting the same `groupId` attribute value for each related deployment, you can more easily see these changes together in New Relic interfaces or use the `groupId` to narrow query results.

            The `groupId` can be any string of your choosing, and you can continue to add deployments to a group after the first use of the `groupId` (in case you want to relate this deployment to one that happened weeks or even months ago).

            <Callout variant="tip">
              In addition to using the `groupId` to relate many deployments, you may also use the attribute to define long-running changes. For example, two deployments with the same `groupId` could bracket a period during which alerts were suppressed or some migration was taking place.

    New Relic automatically sets the `timestamp` and `deploymentId` attributes. You can provide a `timestamp` value as an override, but `deploymentId` will always be generated by New Relic to ensure uniqueness.

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>

        <tr>

            timestamp
          </td>

          <td>
            The time at which the NerdGraph call was received. You can provide an override here as the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch. For example: `timestamp: 1032480000000`.

            <Callout variant="important">
              There is a firm limitation applied that all timestamps must be +/- 24 hours of the current time when the NerdGraph call is received or the payload will be rejected.

          <td>
            `deploymentId`
          </td>

          <td>
            A unique identifier generated when the deployment is recorded. While you cannot set `deploymentId`, you can use it in your NerdGraph and NRQL queries to locate specific deployments. Here's an example: `deploymentId: "8a3a594c-e726-4bc2-8078-26dffec9a3d8"`.
