metaDescription: "Here's how to use GitHub Actions to designate what you want to capture with change tracking."
---


You can use the New Relic change tracking feature in conjunction with [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to monitor the effect of changes on your customers and systems. With GitHub Actions, you can designate which changes to monitor, and then look at the results in the New Relic UI. This allows you to track changes you make in your environment during your release pipeline.

## Inputs [#github-actions-input]

Here are the input elements:

## Example usage [#example-usage]

### GitHub secrets

Make sure the following [Github secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#about-encrypted-secrets) are set:
* `NEW_RELIC_API_KEY` - Personal API key
* `NEW_RELIC_DEPLOYMENT_ENTITY_GUID` - New Relic Entity GUID to create the marker on

Check the [New Relic Application Deployment Marker](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/new-relic-application-deployment-marker) page and click the **Use latest version** button to make sure you use the latest version available.


>*There are a number of [default GitHub environment variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables#default-environment-variables) that are used in these examples as well.*

### Minimum required fields

```yaml
name: Change Tracking Marker
on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  newrelic:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: New Relic
    steps:
      # This step builds a var with the release tag value to use later
      - name: Set Release Version from Tag
        run: echo "RELEASE_VERSION=${{ github.ref_name }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV
      # This step creates a new Change Tracking Marker
      - name: New Relic Application Deployment Marker
        uses: newrelic/deployment-marker-action@v2.3.0
        with:
          apiKey: ${{ secrets.NEW_RELIC_API_KEY }}

          version: "${{ env.RELEASE_VERSION }}"
          user: "${{ github.actor }}"
```

### All input fields

>*In addition to `NEW_RELIC_API_KEY`, this example shows how to target multiple items by storing multiple secrets like "`NEW_RELIC_DEPLOYMENT_ENTITY_GUID_<ID>`", where `<ID>` is the unique identifier for the target item.*

```
NEW_RELIC_DEPLOYMENT_ENTITY_GUID_App123
NEW_RELIC_DEPLOYMENT_ENTITY_GUID_App456

## What's next [#whats-next]

After you've designated the changes you want to track, you can analyze the effect of those changes in the New Relic UI. For details, see [How to view and analyze your changes in New Relic](/docs/change-tracking/change-tracking-view-analyze).
