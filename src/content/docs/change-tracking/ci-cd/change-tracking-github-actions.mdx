metaDescription: "Here's how you can designate which changes you want to track by using GitHub actions."
---


You can use the New Relic change tracking feature in conjunction with GitHub actions to monitor the effect of changes on your customers and systems. With GitHub actions, you can designate which changes to monitor, and then look at the results in the New Relic UI. This allows you to track changes you make in your environment during your release pipeline.

## Inputs [#github-actions-input]

## Usage examples [#example-usage]

Here are some examples of how to use GitHub actions.

### Use release tag for revision [#revision-tags]

You could add the following example as a job to your existing workflow. It
creates a New Relic deployment marker with the revision being the release tag.

Make sure the following Github secrets are set:
* `NEW_RELIC_API_KEY` - Personal API key
* `NEW_RELIC_DEPLOYMENT_ENTITY_GUID` - New Relic Entity GUID to create the marker on

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  - release

jobs:
  newrelic:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: New Relic
    steps:
      - name: Set Release Version from Tag
        run: echo "RELEASE_VERSION=${{ github.ref_name }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV

      - name: Create New Relic deployment marker
        uses: newrelic/deployment-marker-action@v2-beta
        with:
          apiKey: ${{ secrets.NEW_RELIC_API_KEY }}
          guid: ${{ secrets.NEW_RELIC_DEPLOYMENT_ENTITY_GUID }}
          version: "${{ env.RELEASE_VERSION }}"
```

### All input options [#all-input-options]

Add a New Relic application deployment marker on release, with all of the options set.

Make sure the following Github secrets are set:
* `NEW_RELIC_API_KEY` (Personal API key)
* `NEW_RELIC_DEPLOYMENT_ENTITY_GUID` (New Relic Entity GUID to create the marker on)

```yaml
name: Release
on:
  - release

jobs:
  newrelic:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Create New Relic deployment marker
        uses: newrelic/deployment-marker-action@v2-beta
        with:
          apiKey: ${{ secrets.NEW_RELIC_API_KEY }}
          guid: ${{ secrets.NEW_RELIC_DEPLOYMENT_ENTITY_GUID }}
          version: "${{ github.ref }}-${{ github.sha }}"

          # Optional
          changelog: "See https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md for details"
          description: "Automated Deployment via Github Actions"
          region: ${{ secrets.NEW_RELIC_REGION }}
          user: "${{ github.actor }}"
```

## What's next [#whats-next]

After you've designated the changes you want to track, you can analyze the effect of those changes in the New Relic UI. For details, see [How to view and analyze your changes in New Relic](/docs/change-tracking/change-tracking-view-analyze).
