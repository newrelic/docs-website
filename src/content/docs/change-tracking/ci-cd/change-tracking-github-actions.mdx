## Example usage

Here are some examples of how to use GitHub actions.

### Use Release Tag for Revision

The following example could be added as a job to your existing workflow that
creates a New Relic deployment marker with the revision being the release Tag.

Github secrets assumed to be set:
* `NEW_RELIC_API_KEY` - Personal API key
* `NEW_RELIC_DEPLOYMENT_ENTITY_GUID` - New Relic Entity GUID to create the marker on

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  - release

jobs:
  newrelic:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: New Relic
    steps:
      - name: Set Release Version from Tag
        run: echo "RELEASE_VERSION=${{ github.ref_name }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV

      - name: Create New Relic deployment marker
        uses: newrelic/deployment-marker-action@v2-beta
        with:
          apiKey: ${{ secrets.NEW_RELIC_API_KEY }}
          guid: ${{ secrets.NEW_RELIC_DEPLOYMENT_ENTITY_GUID }}
          version: "${{ env.RELEASE_VERSION }}"
```
