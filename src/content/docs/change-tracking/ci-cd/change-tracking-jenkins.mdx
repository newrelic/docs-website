The change tracking feature allows you to designate changes you want to monitor to see how they affect your customers and systems.

While you can designate which changes you want to monitor by using GraphQL or our CLI, you can also record changes using pipelines in Jenkins.

A pipeline will call whatever build you specify and also pass additional environment variables to the build process. This populates the data that is needed for your deployment to show up in charts across New Relic. You'll see the results in the change tracking UIs, and you can use this information to understand the impact of changes on entity health.

Before you get started make sure you're using Jenkins version 2.222.4 or greater.


## Manage the plugin [#install-remove]

To record change tracking deployments you need a special plugin, which you can easily add or remove from your Jenkins instance.

Complete the following steps as a Jenkins administrator.

### Add the plugin [#add-plugin]

<Callout variant="important">
  The plugin installation steps below require a restart of Jenkins.
</Callout>

To add the plugin:

1. Download the plugin from [here](newrelic-deployment-notifier.hpi), and if the filename is changed during download, rename the file to `newrelic-deployment-notifier.hpi`.
    <Callout variant="tip">
      Note that this is a temporary download location for the plugin. We'll let you know when you can download this directly in Jenkins.
    </Callout>
2. Open Jenkins, and click **Manage Jenkins**.

      title="Screenshot showing where to find Manage Jenkins"
      alt="Screenshot showing where to find Manage Jenkins"
      src={trackingJenkinsHomePage}
    />
3. Click **Manage Plugins**.

    <img
      style={{ width: "100%" }}
      title="Screenshot showing where to find Manage Plugins"
      alt="Screenshot showing where to find Manage Plugins"
      src={trackingJenkinsManage}
    />
4. Click **Advanced**.

    <img
      style={{align: "left"}}
      title="Screenshot showing the Advanced button in Jenkins"
      alt="Screenshot showing the Advanced button in Jenkins"
      src={trackingJenkinsAdvanced}
    />
5. Under **Deploy Plugin**, click **Choose File** and upload the file `newrelic-deployment-notifier.hpi`.
6. To finish the installation, make sure no jobs are running, and then restart Jenkins. You can also check the box **Restart Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running**:
    <img
      title="Screenshot showing the box to restart Jenkins"
      alt="Screenshot showing the box to restart Jenkins"
      src={trackingRestartJenkins}
    />

### Remove the Plugin [#remove-plugin]

To remove the plugin using Plugin Manager:

1. Click **Installed**.

    <img
      style={{align: "left"}}
      title="Screenshot of the Installed tab in Jenkins"
      alt="Screenshot of the Installed tab in Jenkins"
      src={trackingJenkinsInstalledTab}
    />
2. Roll it back to the previous version by entering deploy in the search box, selecting **New Relic Deployment Notifier Plugin**, and then clicking the rollback symbol.

    <img
      style={{align: "left"}}
      title="Screenshot showing the rollback button"
      alt="Screenshot showing the rollback button"
      src={trackingJenkinsRollback}
    />
3. You can also uninstall it by clicking the **X** icon.

## Create and run the pipeline [#create-pipeline]

Follow these steps to create a pipeline script that will pass your deployment details to Jenkins when it runs your build. A Jenkins pipeline is a list of steps that are chained together. You can create a Jenkins pipeline in one of two ways:

* Create a `Jenkinsfile` and put it at the root of a source code repository
* Use the pipeline script functionality of Jenkins

Each stage consists of a list of steps, and one of the steps in this part (likely the very last one) is to call the `NewRelicDeploymentNotifier` to put a marker for a successful build.

The plugin we've created takes the GUID as a parameter. You can identify the GUID as a variable in the `Environment` section and use it as a variable in subsequent steps. The build is called by putting it in a stage and list of steps.

1. Go to the pipeline tab, and at the bottom, click **Pipeline Syntax**:

    <img
      style={{ align: "left",width: "100%" }}
      title="Screenshot showing the Pipeline Syntax option"
      alt="Screenshot showing the Pipeline Syntax option"
      src={trackingJenkinsPipelineSyntax}
    />
2. Click the **Sample Step** dropdown and select **step: General Build Step**.

      style={{ align: "left",width: "100%" }}
      title="Screenshot showing how to find the Sample Step dropdown"
      alt="Screenshot showing how to find the Sample Step dropdown"
      src={trackingJenkinsSampleStep}
    />
3. Under **Build Step**, select **New Relic Deployment Notifications**.

    <img
      style={{align: "left"}}
      title="Screenshot showing how to find Deployment Notifications"
      alt="Screenshot showing how to find Deployment Notifications"
      src={trackingJenkinsDeployNotification}
    />
4. Complete the following fields (note REST API fields are also listed if you're not using GraphQL):

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
            Field

5. Click **Generate Pipeline Script**.
6. Copy the script, return to the main pipeline page, and paste it into the pipeline script.

      style={{ align: "left",width: "100%" }}
      title="Screenshot showing an example of pasting into Pipeline tab"
      alt="Screenshot showing an example of pasting into Pipeline tab"
      src={trackingJenkinsPasteScript}
    />
7. Execute the pipeline script to create your deployment marker in New Relic.

<Callout variant="tip">
If you want to still send requests to the New Relic REST API, you can drop the `EntityGuid` and add `applicationID`.
</Callout>

## Move this pipeline script to GitHub [#move-to-github]

You can store pipeline scripts in GitHub. To retrieve the pipeline script, you can specify the location of the GitHub repository when creating an application in Jenkins.

## More about the application GUID [#guid]

Currently, GUIDs cannot be assigned dynamically to the pipeline. You must find the entity GUID in New Relic (see [Learn about New Relic entities](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic#find) and then hardcode this value in the pipeline script to report deployment notifications for that entity. This information is not sensitive and can be stored publicly.

The credentials used to update the application should mitigate sending bad deployment markers. In addition, the credentials are referenced by ID in Jenkins, so they do not need to be stored in source code repositories.

## How to detect if failures occur [#failures]

Pipeline syntax errors will halt the pipeline. Pipeline parsing errors (like missing build steps) will halt the pipeline. You should troubleshoot these using Jenkins tools to construct appropriate pipeline scripts. Using the WYSIWYG Pipeline Syntax tool in Jenkins can help you appropriately construct the New Relic deployment notification.

If the plugin detects an error, it should not halt the pipeline. It will log an exception and a stack trace, and then it will continue. This helps you prevent interruptions when building and deploying applications.

## What's next [#whats-next]

After you've designated the changes you want to track, you can analyze the effect of those changes in the New Relic UI. For details, see [How to view and analyze your changes in New Relic](/docs/change-tracking/change-tracking-view-analyze).
