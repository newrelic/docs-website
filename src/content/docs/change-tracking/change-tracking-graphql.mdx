metaDescription: "Here are some examples of how you can use GraphQL to designate changes to track."
---

The change tracking feature allows you to track the effect of various changes on your customers and systems. For example, if you make some deployments, you can use the change tracking feature to monitor the results in New Relic UI charts. You'll also get access to features that help you understand the effects of those changes.

Instead of designating which changes you want to monitor by using our CLI or a CI/CD integration, you can do the same thing using GraphQL mutations and queries via our NerdGraph API. 

For general information on using NerdGraph, see [Introduction to NerdGraph](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph).

## Requirements [#api-requirements]

Requirements include:

* [NerdGraph requirements](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph/#authentication)
* User permissions: Any [user type](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/user-type) can use NerdGraph to create deployment markers and track other changes, but only full platform users can access the curated change tracking UI experiences.

## Understand fields in NerdGraph explorer [#field-definitions]

The fields you'll use in your GraphQL queries fall into these general types:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="required-fields"
    title="Required deployment attributes"
  >
    To track a change, such as a deployment, you must set the following:
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
            Attribute
          </th>
          <th>
            Description
          </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>
              `entityGuid`
            </td>
            <td>
              The `entityGuid` value is the unique identifier assigned by New Relic to your system components during instrumentation and setup processes. For more information on New Relic Entities and finding Entity GUIDs, see this [guide](/docs/new-relic-solutions/new-relic-one/core-concepts/what-entity-new-relic/#find).
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>
              `version`
            </td>
            <td>
              The version attribute value can be anything, although we recommend using the version number set during your build process. To see an example of how this can be done, see our [Jenkins deployments plugin documentation](#jenkins-markers) below. If you already report version numbers to New Relic mobile monitoring or by some other means, we recommend using the same here to set yourself up for forthcoming features that will allow you to facet and correlate data by version.
            </td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <Callout variant="tip">
      If you are transitioning away from the legacy REST API, you'll need to start using your application's entity GUID instead of the appID. You can easily find the GUID in NerdGraph with this query:

      ```graphql
      {
        actor {
          entitySearch(query: "domainId=INSERT_YOUR_APPID") {
            count
            query
            results {
              entities {
                entityType
                name
                guid
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
      ```
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="optional-fields"
    title="Optional deployment attributes"
  >

    You can define some optional and useful attributes to add context to the change you are tracking. These attributes can also enable certain change tracking features.

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
            Attribute
          </th>
          <th>
            Description
          </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            `changelog`
          </td>
          <td>
            You can submit a URL or any string for the changelog attribute. For example: `changelog: "Added: /v2/deployments.rb, Removed: None"` or `changelog: "https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v4.2.3/CHANGELOG.md"`.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            `description`
          </td>
          <td>
            You can submit any string for the description attribute. For example: `description: "Added a deployments resource to the v2 API"`.

            The description attribute may be where you choose to insert codified information from your internal deployment management processes, such as IDs or tags you assign to each commit or deployment that describes organizational or business aspect of the work, for example, `EU_MAINT_DMARK_v101`.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            `commit`
          </td>
          <td>
            You can submit any string for the `commit` attribute, and we suggest using the commit SHA associated with the deployment or change, for example, `commit: "r3ws4sa43f"`.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            `deepLink`
          </td>
          <td>
            You can submit any URL for the `deepLink` attribute.  We suggest using one that will help someone evaluating a deployment on New Relic quickly get to a place where they can take further action, such as Jenkins, ArgoCD, or GitHub Actions. Here's an example: `deepLink: "http://localhost:8080/job/PipelineV2/configure"`.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            `deploymentType`
          </td>
          <td>
            You can divide changes related to deployments into different types. These types align with common deployment techniques, but there is also an OTHER type. Types include:
              * BASIC
              * BLUE_GREEN
              * CANARY
              * ROLLING
              * SHADOW
              * OTHER


            Assigning a type to each deployment will help you filter results on change tracking interfaces and NerdGraph/NRQL query results.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            `groupId`
          </td>
          <td>
            You may want to group deployments in cases where you're making a series of changes to one or more entities or releasing many changes across many entities within your system. By setting the same `groupID` attribute value for each related deployment, you can more easily see these changes together in New Relic interfaces or use the `groupID` to narrow query results. 

            The `groupID` can be any string of your choosing, and you can continue to add deployments to a group after the first use of the `groupID` (in case you want to relate this deployment to one that happened weeks or even months ago).

            <Callout variant="tip">
              In addition to using the `groupId` to relate many deployments, you may also use the attribute to define long-running changes. For example, two deployments with the same `groupId` could bracket a period during which alerts were suppressed or some migration was taking place.
            </Callout>

    New Relic automatically sets the `user`, `timestamp`, and `deploymentId` attributes. You can provide `user` and `timestamp` values as overrides, but `deploymentId` will always be generated by New Relic to ensure uniqueness.

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
            Attribute

        <tr>
          <td>
            timestamp
          </td>
          <td>
            The time at which the recorded change occurred or the NerdGraph call was received. For example: `timestamp: 2019-10-08T00:15:36Z`.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            `deploymentId`
          </td>
          <td>
            A unique identifier generated when the deployment is recorded. While you cannot set `deploymentId`, you can use it in your NerdGraph and NRQL queries to locate specific deployments. Here's an example: `deploymentId: “8a3a594c-e726-4bc2-8078-26dffec9a3d8”`.

## Create a deployment marker using a mutation [#mutation-examples]

To record a change, such as a deployment, you'll need to include the required fields, and then decide if you want to include any optional fields.

Here are some example GraphQL mutations that show some ways to create deployment markers:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="simple-mutation"
    title="Mutation with only required fields"
  >
  ``` graphql
  mutation {
    changeTrackingCreateDeployment(
      deployment: {
        version: "0.0.1",
        entityGuid: "INSERT_YOUR_GUID"
      }
    )
      {
        deploymentId
        entityGuid
      }
  }
  ```

  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="optional-mutation-example"
    title="Mutation with optional fields"
  >
  ```graphql
  mutation {
    changeTrackingCreateDeployment(
      deployment: {
        version: "0.0.1",
        user: "INSERT_YOUR_NAME",
        timestamp: INSERT_MS_EPOCH_TIMESTAMP,
        groupId: "78641",
        entityGuid: "INSERT_YOUR_GUID",
        description: "create a new marker",
        deploymentType: BASIC,
        deepLink: "example.com/path",
        commit: "INSERT_A_COMMIT_HASH",
        changelog: "test log"
      }
    )
    {
      changelog
      commit
      deepLink
      deploymentId
      deploymentType
      description
      entityGuid
      groupId
      timestamp
      user
      version
    }
  }
  ```

  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>


## Query deployments [#query-events]

You can use GraphQL and NRQL queries to fetch data about changes related to deployments. See the examples below to try out some queries. You can also learn about GraphQL queries in the [NerdGraph entities API tutorial](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-entities-api-tutorial/).

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="query-deployments"
    title="Use GraphQL to query deployments"
  >
    The examples below show how to get information about deployments and their attributes. Be sure to insert your own values for `guid`, along with Unix epoch timestamps for `startTime` and `endTime` in milliseconds:

    <CollapserGroup>
      <Collapser
        className="freq-link"
        id="query-one"
        title="Query example one"
      >
```graphql
{
  actor {
    entity(guid: "INSERT_YOUR_GUID_HERE") {
      deploymentSearch(
        filter: {
          timeWindow: {endTime: INSERT_MS_EPOCH_TIMESTAMP,
          startTime: INSERT_MS_EPOCH_TIMESTAMP
          }
        }
      )
      {
        results {
          version
          entityGuid
          timestamp
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
      </Collapser>
      <Collapser
        className="freq-link"
        id="query-two"
        title="Query example two"
      >
```graphql
{
  actor {
    entity(guid: "INSERT_YOUR_GUID_HERE") {
      deploymentSearch(
        filter: {
          timeWindow: {
            endTime: INSERT_MS_EPOCH_TIMESTAMP,
            startTime: INSERT_MS_EPOCH_TIMESTAMP
          },
          query: "user = 'Test User'"
        }
      )
      {
        results {
          version
          entityGuid
          timestamp
          changelog
          commit
          deepLink
          deploymentId
          description
          deploymentType
          groupId
          user
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
      </Collapser>
      <Collapser
        className="freq-link"
        id="query-three"
        title="Query example three"
      >
```graphql
{
  actor {
    entity(guid: "INSERT_YOUR_GUID_HERE") {
      deploymentSearch(
        filter: {
          timeWindow: {
            endTime: INSERT_MS_EPOCH_TIMESTAMP,
            startTime: INSERT_MS_EPOCH_TIMESTAMP
          },
          query: "((user = 'Test User' AND version = '1.0') OR deploymentType in ('BLUE_GREEN', 'CANARY'))", limit: 200
        }
      )
      {
        results {
          changelog
          commit
          deepLink
          deploymentId
          deploymentType
          description
          entityGuid
          groupId
          timestamp
          user
          version
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

    </CollapserGroup>
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="key-signals"
    title="Use NRQL to render a chart with a key signal and deployment markers"
  >
    After you create a marker using GraphQL, you can use the [query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder/) to create time series charts, draw curves for a telemetry signal over a span of time, and render deployments as markers.

    Here are some NRQL examples you could run in query builder to create some charts:

    <CollapserGroup>
      <Collapser
        className="freq-link"
        id="nrql-one"
        title="NRQL example one"
      >
```

```
      </Collapser>
      <Collapser
        className="freq-link"
        id="nrql-two"
        title="NRQL example two"
      >
```
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM Transaction
WHERE appName = 'INSERT_YOUR_APP_NAME'
FACET name

SINCE 1 week ago TIMESERIES
```

## What's next [#whats-next]

After you've designated the changes you want to track, you can analyze the effect of those changes in the New Relic UI. For details, see [How to view and analyze your changes in New Relic](/docs/change-tracking/change-tracking-view-analyze).
