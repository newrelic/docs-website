Sliding windows are a technique for generating charts using the `SLIDE BY` clause in conjunction with the `TIMESERIES` clause. With sliding windows, data is gathered in time "windows" that overlap with each other.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Sliding windows are also available via the UI in the condition [advanced signal settings](/docs/alerts-applied-intelligence/new-relic-alerts/alert-conditions/create-nrql-alert-conditions/#advanced-signal).
</Callout>

For example, in the image below, a query gathers data with 5 minute windows. The windows "slide" by 1 minute. Each window overlaps with the previous window by 4 minutes.

In contrast, with "tumbling" or "cascading" windows, the windows do not overlap. For example, in this `TIMESERIES 3 minutes` NRQL query, the windows are 3 minutes in length, with each beginning when the other ends. There is no overlap in the measurement interval.

## When to use sliding windows [#when-to-use]

Sliding windows are helpful when you need to smooth out "spiky" charts. One common use case is to use sliding windows to smooth line graphs that have a lot of variation over short periods of time in cases where the rolling aggregate (for example a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time.

In the example below, data varies greatly from one minute to another, so the 1-minute tumbling window chart shows many high peaks and low valleys.

However, in this example, 5-minute wide `TIMESERIES` windows are smoothed with the help of 1-minute `SLIDE BY` intervals. The query returns similar data but creates a much smoother chart.

## Valid NRQL syntax for `SLIDE BY` [#valid-syntax]

Valid NRQL syntax for the `SLIDE BY` clause will follow the format below.

```sql
SELECT ... TIMESERIES integer1 units SLIDE BY integer2 units
```

`integer1` specifies the sliding window width and `integer2` specifies the `SLIDE BY` interval. `units` is a time unit, such as `second`, `minute`, `hour`, or `day`. All standard NRQL time units are accepted.

Hereâ€™s a real-life example. It shows 5-minute `TIMESERIES` windows with a 1-minute `SLIDE BY` interval.

```sql
SELECT average(duration) from Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute
```

## Translation from PromQL-style queries [#translate-promql]

When applicable, a PromQL-style query is translated into a NRQL sliding window query.

For example, if your PromQL style query uses `rate(request_count[5m])` for the past 60 minutes with a 1-minute window overlap, the NRQL translation would be the query below.

```sql
SELECT rate(sum(request_count), 1 SECONDS) FROM Metric SINCE 3600 SECONDS AGO UNTIL NOW 
FACET dimensions() LIMIT 100 TIMESERIES 300000 SLIDE BY 60000
```

In the translation output, the default unit of millisecond is used for `TIMESERIES` and `SLIDE BY` clauses. For `TIMESERIES`, 300000 ms is 300 seconds, or 5 minutes, specifying a window size of 5 minutes. For `SLIDE BY`, 60000 ms is 60 seconds, specifying a slide interval of 1 minute.

## Use `SLIDE BY` with `MAX` and `AUTO` [#auto-max]

You can combine `SLIDE BY` with `MAX` and `AUTO` arguments to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below.

```sql
SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX
```

```sql
SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO
```

<Callout variant="tip">
  When paired with `SLIDE BY`, `TIMESERIES` does not support `AUTO` or `MAX`. The `TIMESERIES` value must be an integer time unit value. In other words, `SLIDE BY AUTO` or `SLIDE BY MAX` will work, but `TIMESERIES AUTO` or `TIMESERIES MAX` followed by `SLIDE BY` and `MAX`, `AUTO`, or a specific integer time unit is not supported.
</Callout>

<Callout variant="tip">
  The `SLIDE BY` value as determined by `AUTO` or `MAX` can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which will show up as gaps and unexpected results. If you experience these issues with query results, consider checking for instances of `SLIDE BY` where the step interval exceeds the window size.
