With [NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql), you can create queries that group results across time. For example, you can group results together based on timestamps by separating them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times.

When using [time functions](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/time-settings/set-time-range-insights-dashboards-charts) in NRQL queries, the results are returned in UTC. To adjust the results to your time zone, include the [`WITH TIMEZONE` clause](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-resources/nrql-syntax-components-functions#sel-timezone) in your query.

## Facet your NRQL query time range [#cohorts]

To create your NRQL query, use a [`FACET` clause](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-resources/nrql-syntax-components-functions#sel-facett) with a bucket function that works with a timestamp attribute. Run a standard `FACET` query, but instead of faceting by an attribute, facet by time. For example:

```
SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET monthOf(account_created)
```

To perform multiple functions within the same query, use NRQL's multi-facet capability:

```
SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET dateOf(account_created), monthOf(account_created)
```

      <td>
        Returns the quarter of the year. The returned value includes both the quarter and the year.

    <tr>
      <td>
        `weekdayOf(attr)`
      </td>

      <td>
        Returns the day of the week of the timestamp. The returned value loops back at the end of the week, allowing you to look at trends by weekday over time.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `dateOf(attr)`
      </td>

      <td>
        Returns the date of the timestamp. The returned value includes month, day and year.

        Example: `July 15, 2014`

    <tr>
      <td>
        `dayOfMonthOf(attr)`
      </td>

      <td>
        Returns the numeric date within a single month of the timestamp, a value from 1 to 31. The returned value does not include the month.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        `hourOf(attr)`
      </td>

      <td>
        Returns the hour of the timestamp.

        The returned value does not include a prepended 0 for hours between 1am and 9am. This differs from functions and clauses such as `SINCE`, which accept these hours with a 0 at the start.

        Examples: `6:00`, `12:00`, `18:00`

    To group all results based on the month, use the `monthOf` function. In this example, the NRQL query includes a function (`count(*)`), a data type (`PageView`), a time frame (`SINCE 1 day ago`), and a time facet (`monthOf(attribute)`).

    ```
    SELECT count(*) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago FACET monthOf(account_created)
    ```

    Running the query returns a table of results by month.

    You can run NRQL queries to group your data in other ways, not just time. For additional examples, see the [NRQL `FACET` documentation](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-resources/nrql-syntax-components-functions#sel-facet).
