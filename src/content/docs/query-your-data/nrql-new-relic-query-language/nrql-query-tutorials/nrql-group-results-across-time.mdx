With [NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql), you can create queries that group results across time. For example, you can group results together based on timestamps by separating them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times.

<img

  alt="NRQL facet by time"
  src={queriesFacetByTime}

When using [time functions](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/time-settings/set-time-range-insights-dashboards-charts) in NRQL queries, the results are returned in UTC. To adjust the results to your time zone, include the [`WITH TIMEZONE` clause](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-resources/nrql-syntax-components-functions#sel-timezone) in your query.

## Facet your NRQL query time range [#cohorts]

To create your NRQL query, use a [`FACET` clause](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-resources/nrql-syntax-components-functions#sel-facett) with a bucket function that works with a timestamp attribute. Run a standard `FACET` query, but instead of faceting by an attribute, facet by time. For example:

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM K8sDaemonsetSample FACET monthOf(createdAt)
```

The screenshot at the top of this doc shows the results of this query.

To perform multiple functions within the same query, use NRQL's multi-facet capability:

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM K8sDaemonsetSample FACET dateOf(createdAt), monthOf(createdAt)
```
<img
  title="NRQL facet by time with two functions"
  alt="NRQL facet by time with two functions"
  src={queriesFacetByTimeTwoFunctions}
/>

Many time-based functions accept an optional second argument of either `string` (the default) or `numeric`, which controls the format of the result value.

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM K8sDaemonsetSample FACET monthOf(createdAt, numeric)
```

    To group all results based on the month, use the `monthOf` function. In this example, the NRQL query includes a function (`count(*)`), a data type, a time frame (`SINCE 1 day ago`), and a time facet (`monthOf(createdAt)`).

    ```sql
    SELECT count(*) FROM K8sDaemonsetSample SINCE 1 day ago FACET monthOf(createdAt)
    ```

    Running the query returns a table of results by month.

    You can run NRQL queries to group your data in other ways, not just time. For additional examples, see the [NRQL `FACET` documentation](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-resources/nrql-syntax-components-functions#sel-facet).

    You need to be aware of `UNTIL` you add the `TIMESERIES` function and use the time function in a time series chart.

    The default value of `UNTIL` is `NOW`, so if you do not specify anything, the values of the time functions may be separated or combined.

    By specifying `UNTIL today`, you can create a chart that ends at 12:00 AM on the same day.

    ```sql
    SELECT count(*) FROM PageView TIMESERIES 1 day WITH TIMEZONE 'Europe/London' SINCE 4 week ago UNTIL today
    ```

    If you want to visualize data from `last month` instead of the past four weeks, you can use `SINCE last month UNTIL this month`.

    ```sql
    SELECT count(*) FROM PageView TIMESERIES 1 day  WITH TIMEZONE 'Europe/London' SINCE last month UNTIL this month
    ```
