With nested aggregation, you can complete a [NRQL query](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql), then make additional computations using the results of that query. Nested aggregation provides NRQL capabilities similar to the class of SQL subqueries or subselects where the subquery is in the `FROM` clause of the outer query.

<Callout variant="tip">
This feature is different from our [subquery feature](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/subqueries-in-nrql), which allows for subqueries in `SELECT` and `WHERE` clauses.

## Answer complex questions with a single query [#why-matters]

Nested aggregation can help you to answer questions like these without building multiple queries:

* How can I count the requests per minute for my application, then get the maximum requests per minute for the last hour?
* How can I compute the average CPU usage of all my servers or hosts, and list only the ones with usage over 90%?
* From all my user sessions, how can I figure out what percentage bounced immediately?

For an example of how to use nested aggregation with an app's error rate query to get percentage data and more, watch this YouTube video (approx. 3:10 minutes).

## Nested aggregation query structure and clauses [#requirements]

Every NRQL query [must begin with a `SELECT` statement or a `FROM` clause](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions). A nested aggregation query uses both a `SELECT` statement and a `FROM` clause and applies them to a whole query or queries contained within parentheses.

A complete and properly formatted nested aggregation query will look something like this:

```sql
SELECT function(attribute)
FROM (
  SELECT function(attribute)
  FROM dataType
  WHERE attribute
  TIMESERIES integer units
)
```

A few other details about query and clause behavior:

* Nested queries can be more than two levels.
* Both `TIMESERIES` and `FACET` can be applied to any part of the nested query, and don’t need to be identical at all levels.
* `SINCE`, `UNTIL`, and `COMPARE WITH` clauses apply to the entire query and can only be used at the outermost level.

## Nested aggregation query examples [#examples]

Here are some examples of nested queries.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="total-tx"
    title="Total transactions and highest one-minute response rate"
  >
    In this example, the inner query first counts the transactions for `myApp` for each of the last 60 minutes, then the outer query returns the highest 1-minute request rate.

    Also, by giving a name to the result of the first query (as rpm), you can create a label for the value returned. Without adding the label, this query will return the value as count for use in the outer query.

    ```sql
    SELECT max(rpm)
    FROM (
      SELECT count(*) as rpm
      FROM Transaction
      WHERE appName = 'myApp'
      TIMESERIES 1 minute
    )
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="avg-cpu"
    title="Average CPU usage and CPU usage over 90%"
  >
    In this example, the inner query calculates the average CPU usage for all hosts, then the outer query filters the results down to only hosts with CPU usage over a risky threshold (90%).

    ```sql
    SELECT hostname, cpu
    FROM (
      SELECT average(cpuPercent) as cpu
      FROM SystemSample
      FACET hostname
      TIMESERIES 1 minute
    )
    WHERE cpu > 90
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="pageviews"
    title="Page views in each user session and number of sessions with only one page view"
  >
    In this example, the inner query calculates the number of `PageView` events in each user session, then the outer query computes what percentage of those sessions only had a single associated view.

    ```sql
    SELECT percentage(count (*), WHERE sessionLength = 1)
    FROM (
      SELECT count(*) as sessionLength
      FROM PageView
      FACET session
    )
    ```
