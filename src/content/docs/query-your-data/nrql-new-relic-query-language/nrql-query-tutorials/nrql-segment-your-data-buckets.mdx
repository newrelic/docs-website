Using [NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql), you can split your query results into buckets that cover certain ranges using the [`buckets` function](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference/nrql-syntax-components-functions#func-buckets) .

## Create bucketed NRQL query [#segmentation]

To return bucketed results, use the `FACET buckets()` clause in a NRQL query. A bucketing query has the structure:

```
SELECT FUNCTION(ATTRIBUTE) 
    FROM DATA_TYPE 
    FACET buckets(ATTRIBUTE, CEILING_VALUE, NUMBER_OF_BUCKETS)
```

Bucketing can be used with any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database.

## Bucket query example [#example]

1. Create a NRQL statement with a `SELECT` statement for an attribute; for example, `SELECT average(duration)`.
2. Add a `FACET` clause that facets on `buckets()`. For example `buckets(duration, 40, 10)`. You can also bucket on a different attribute than the one in the `SELECT` statement. For example, to show the average duration for database calls: `buckets(databaseCallCount, 40, 10)`.

This query computes the average duration for a specific page path across 10 buckets, with an upper limit of 40. All values above our upper limit of 400 are grouped in the last bucket, `>=36.0`.

```sql
SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView WHERE pageUrl LIKE 'http://webportal.telco%' SINCE 1 week ago FACET buckets(duration, 40, 10)
```

This query returns the following results:
