There are several ways to [query your data](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/query-new-relic-data). This document will show you some example [NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql) queries from mobile monitoring data. To see descriptions of the mobile-reported events and attributes available, see [Mobile events](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data/mobile-default-event-attributes-insights).

## Mobile, MobileSession, and MobileCrash event query examples [#mobile-examples]

Mobile queries allow you to understand and compare a wide variety of mobile data, including interactions, location, device profile, app version, crashes, and performance.

These examples use queries made on the `Mobile`, `MobileSession`, and `MobileCrash` event types:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="mobilex-interactions"
    title={<><strong>Interactions</strong>: Which interactions are most popular among my users?</>}
  >
    ```
    SELECT uniqueCount(uuid) FROM Mobile SINCE 1 day ago FACET name
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="china-regions"
    title={<><strong>Location</strong>: Which regions of China have the most users?</>}
  >
    ```
    SELECT uniqueCount(uuid) FROM MobileSession WHERE countryCode='CN' FACET regionCode SINCE 7 days ago
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="mobilex-deviceprofile"
    title={<><strong>Device profile</strong>: How many users use the latest OS versions?</>}
  >
    ```
    SELECT uniqueCount(uuid) FROM MobileSession FACET osVersion SINCE 7 days ago
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="mobilex-appversion"
    title={<><strong>App version</strong>: Have we seen an increase in session duration since yesterday's release?</>}
  >
    ```
    SELECT percentile(sessionDuration, 90) FROM MobileSession since 1 day ago compare with 2 days ago
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="memusage-example"
    title={<><strong>Performance</strong>: How much memory does my app use for sessions longer than 5 seconds?</>}
  >
    ```
    SELECT histogram(memUsageMb) FROM MobileSession WHERE sessionDuration > 5
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="mobilex-crashes"
    title={<><strong>Crashes</strong>: What are my app's most common crashes?</>}
  >
    ```
    SELECT count(*) FROM MobileCrash FACET crashException
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="mobilex-crashrate"
    title={<><strong>Crash rate</strong>: What is the crash rate for different versions of my app?</>}
  >
    ```
    SELECT percentage(uniqueCount(sessionId), WHERE category = 'Crash') as `Crash rate` FROM MobileSession, MobileCrash facet appVersion since 90 days ago
    ```
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## MobileRequest event query examples [#mobilerequest-examples]

This feature requires mobile monitoring agent version 5.14.0 or higher. `MobileRequest` data is enabled by default for:

* [Android version 5.15.2](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/android-release-notes/android-5152) or higher
* [iOS version 6.0.0](/docs/release-notes/mobile-release-notes/ios-release-notes/ios-agent-600) or higher

For earlier versions, starting with Android version 5.14.0 or iOS version 5.14.0, you must enable the feature. Upgrade to the latest [Android](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-android/install-configure/upgrade-new-relic-mobiles-android-sdk) or [iOS](/docs/mobile-monitoring/new-relic-mobile-ios/installation/upgrade-new-relic-mobiles-ios-sdk) version, or add the required [feature flag](/docs/mobile-monitoring/mobile-monitoring-ui/network-pages/analyze-network-requests-using-mobilerequest-event-data) to your app.

Below are some NRQL queries that address common use cases. Use the [`MobileRequest` attributes](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-data/mobile-default-event-attributes-insights#mobilerequest-attributes) to make your own NRQL queries. The last two examples use [MobileRequestError](#mobilerequesterror-examples) events in addition to `MobileRequest` to get an error rate.
