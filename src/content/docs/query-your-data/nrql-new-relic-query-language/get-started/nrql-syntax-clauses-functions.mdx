## Query components [#clauses]

Every NRQL query will begin with a `SELECT` statement or a `FROM` clause. All other clauses are optional. The clause definitions below also contain example NRQL queries.

### Required clauses [#required]

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="state-select"
    title={<>Required: <InlineCode>SELECT</InlineCode> statement</>}
  >
    ```sql
    SELECT attribute ...
    ```

    ```sql
    SELECT function(attribute) ...
    ```

    The `SELECT` specifies what portion of a data type you want to query by specifying an [attribute](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/get-started/glossary/#attribute) or a [function](#functions). It's followed by one or more arguments separated by commas. In each argument you can:

    * Get the values of all available attributes by using `*` as a wildcard. For example: `SELECT * from Transaction`.
    * Get values associated with a specified attribute or multiple attributes specified in a [comma separated list](#commas).
    * Get aggregated values from specified attributes by selecting an [aggregator function](#functions).
    * Label the results returned in each argument with [the `AS` clause](#sel-as).

    You can also [use `SELECT` with basic math functions](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-math-using-select).

    <CollapserGroup>
      <Collapser
        id="avg-resp-time-query"
        title="Avg response time since last week"
      >
        This query returns the average response time since last week.

        ```sql
        SELECT average(duration) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago
        ```
      </Collapser>
    </CollapserGroup>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="sel-from"
    title={<>Required: <InlineCode>FROM</InlineCode> clause</>}
  >
    ```sql
    SELECT ...
      FROM data type
      ...
    ```

    Use the `FROM` clause to specify the [data type](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql#what-you-can-query) you wish to query. You can start your query with `FROM` or with [`SELECT`](#state-select). You can merge values for the same attributes across multiple data types in a [comma separated list](#commas).

      <Collapser
        id="one-event"
        title="Query one data type"
      >
        This query returns the count of all [APM transactions](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/decorating-events/insights-attributes#transaction-defaults) over the last seven days:

        ```sql

        ```
      </Collapser>

      <Collapser
        id="multiple-events"
        title="Query multiple data types"
      >
        This query returns the count of all [APM transactions](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/decorating-events/insights-attributes#transaction-defaults) and [browser events](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/decorating-events/browser-default-attributes-insights#browser-attributes-table) over the last three days:

        ```sql
        SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction, PageView SINCE 3 days ago
        ```
      </Collapser>
    </CollapserGroup>
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

### Optional clauses [#optional]

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="sel-as"
    title={<><InlineCode>AS</InlineCode> clause</>}
  >
    ```sql
    SELECT ...
      AS 'label'
      ...
    ```

    Use the `AS` clause to label an attribute, aggregator, step in a funnel, or the result of a math function with a string delimited by single quotes. The label is used in the resulting chart.

    <CollapserGroup>
      <Collapser
        id="math-as"
        title={<>Query using math function and <InlineCode>AS</InlineCode></>}

        This query returns the number of page views per session:

        ```sql

        ```
      </Collapser>

      <Collapser
        id="funnel-as"
        title={<>Query using funnel and <InlineCode>AS</InlineCode></>}
      >
        This query returns a count of people who have visited both the main page and the careers page of a site over the past week:

        ```sql
        SELECT funnel(SESSION,
            WHERE name='Controller/about/main' AS 'Step 1',
            WHERE name = 'Controller/about/careers' AS 'Step 2')
            FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago
        ```
      </Collapser>
    </CollapserGroup>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="sel-compare"
    title={<><InlineCode>COMPARE WITH</InlineCode> clause</>}
  >
    ```sql
    SELECT ... (SINCE or UNTIL) (integer units) AGO
      COMPARE WITH (integer units) AGO
      ...
    ```

    Use the `COMPARE WITH` clause to compare the values for two different time ranges.

    `COMPARE WITH` requires a `SINCE` or `UNTIL` statement. The time specified by `COMPARE WITH` is relative to the time specified by `SINCE` or `UNTIL`. For example, `SINCE 1 day ago COMPARE WITH 1 day ago` compares yesterday with the day before.

    The time range for the`COMPARE WITH` value is always the same as that specified by `SINCE` or `UNTIL`. For example, `SINCE 2 hours ago COMPARE WITH 4 hours ago` might compare 3:00pm through 5:00pm against 11:00am through 1:00pm.

    `COMPARE WITH` can be formatted as either a line chart or a billboard:

    * With `TIMESERIES`, `COMPARE WITH` creates a line chart with the comparison mapped over time.
    * Without `TIMESERIES`, `COMPARE WITH` generates a billboard with the current value and the percent change from the `COMPARE WITH` value.

    **Example**: This query returns data as a line chart showing the 95th percentile for the past week compared to the same range one week ago. First as a single value, then as a line chart.

    ```sql
    SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView
      SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO

    SELECT percentile(duration, 95) FROM PageView
      SINCE 1 week ago COMPARE WITH 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO
    ```

    <Callout variant="important">
      For `FACET` queries using `COMPARE WITH`, the facets in the result are selected based on the time range specified using `SINCE` and `UNTIL` and not the prior time range being compared. The results of a `FACET` query for the prior time range alone may include a different set of facets.
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="extrapolate"
    title={<><InlineCode>EXTRAPOLATE</InlineCode> clause</>}
  >
    You can use this clause with these data types:

    * `Transaction`

    * `TransactionError`

    * Custom events reported via APM agent APIs

      The purpose of `EXTRAPOLATE` is to mathematically compensate for the effects of [APM agent sampling of event data](/docs/agents/manage-apm-agents/agent-data/new-relic-events-limits-sampling) so that query results more closely represent the total activity in your system.

      This clause will be useful when a APM agent reports so many [events](/docs/using-new-relic/metrics/analyze-your-metrics/data-collection-metric-timeslice-event-data#event-data) that it often passes its [harvest cycle](/docs/using-new-relic/welcome-new-relic/getting-started/glossary#harvest-cycle) reporting limits. When that occurs, the agent begins to sample events.

      When `EXTRAPOLATE` is used in a NRQL query that supports its use, the ratio between the **reported events** and the **total events** is used to extrapolate a close approximation of the total unsampled data. When it is used in a NRQL query that doesn’t support its use or that hasn’t used sampled data, it has no effect.

      <Callout variant="important">
        Note that `EXTRAPOLATE` is most useful for homogenous data (like throughput or error rate). It's not effective when attempting to extrapolate a count of distinct things (like `uniqueCount()` or `uniques()`).
      </Callout>

      This clause works only with NRQL queries that use one of the following [aggregator functions](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference/nrql-syntax-components-functions#functions):

    * `apdex`

    * `average`

    * `count`

    * `histogram`

    * `sum`

    * `percentage` (if function it takes as an argument supports `EXTRAPOLATE`)

    * `rate` (if function it takes as an argument supports `EXTRAPOLATE`)

    * `stddev`

      <CollapserGroup>
        <Collapser
          id="extrapolate-example-1"
          title="Example of extrapolating throughput"
        >
          A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named `interestingApplication`.

          A query that will show the extrapolated throughput of a service named `interestingApplication` by transaction name, displayed as a time series.

    title={<><InlineCode>FACET</InlineCode> clause</>}
  >
    ```sql
    SELECT ...
      FACET attribute
      ...
    ```

    Use `FACET` to separate and group your results by attribute values. For example, you could `FACET` your `PageView` data by `deviceType` to figure out what percentage of your traffic comes from mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

    Use the `LIMIT` clause to specify how many facets appear (default is 10). For more complex grouping, use [`FACET CASES`](#sel-facet-cases). `FACET` clauses support up to five attributes, separated by commas.

    The facets are sorted in descending order by the first field you provide in the `SELECT` clause. If you are faceting on attributes with more than 2,000 unique values, a subset of facet values is selected and sorted according to the query type.

    When selecting `min()`, `max()`, `percentile()`, `average()` or `count()`, `FACET` uses those functions to determine how facets are picked and sorted. When selecting any other [function](#functions), `FACET` uses the frequency of the attribute you are faceting on to determine how facets are picked and sorted.

        [Advanced segmentation](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/features/advanced-segmentation) and [cohort analysis](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/features/cohort-analysis-grouping-results-across-time) allow you to facet on bucket functions to more effectively break out your data.

        Cohort analysis is a way to group results together based on timestamps. You can separate them into buckets that cover a specified range of dates and times.

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="facet-as"
    title={<><InlineCode>FACET ... AS</InlineCode> clause</>}
  >
    Use `FACET ... AS` to name facets using the `AS` keyword in queries. This clause is helpful for adding clearer or simplified names for facets in your results. It can also be used to rename facets in [nested aggregation](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-tutorials/nested-aggregation-make-ordered-computations-single-query) queries.

    `FACET ... AS` queries will change the facet names in results (when they appear as headers in tables, for example), but not the actual facet names themselves.

    ```sql
    FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) FACET response.headers.contentType AS 'content type'
    ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser

    SELECT ...
      FACET CASES (
        WHERE attribute operator value, WHERE attribute operator value, ...
        )
      ...
    ```

    Use `FACET CASES` to break out your data by more complex conditions than possible with [`FACET`](#sel-facet). Separate multiple conditions with a comma `,`. For example, you could query your PageView data and `FACET CASES` into categories like less than 1 second, from 1 to 10 seconds, and greater than 10 seconds. You can combine multiple attributes within your cases, and label the cases with the [`AS`](#sel-as) selector. Data points will be added to at most one facet case, the first facet case that they match.

    You may also use a [time function](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-examples/group-results-across-time) with your attribute, and you can use the `OR` operator to facet results that don't match any of your specified cases.

        This example groups results into one bucket where the transaction name contains `login`, and another where the URL contains `login` and a custom attribute indicates that the user was a paid user:

        ```sql
        SELECT count(*) FROM Transaction FACET CASES (WHERE name LIKE '%login%', WHERE name LIKE '%feature%' AND customer_type='Paid') OR name

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="sel-facet-order"
    title={<><InlineCode>FACET ... ORDER BY</InlineCode> clause</>}
  >
    In NRQL, the default is for the first aggregation in the `SELECT` clause to guide the selection of facets in a query. `FACET ... ORDER BY` allows you to override this default behavior by adding an aggregate function with the ORDER BY modifier to specify how facets are selected. Specifically, the clause will override the priority by which facets are chosen to be in the final result before being limited by the `LIMIT` clause. This clause can be used in querying but not for alerts or streaming.

    This example shows how to use `FACET ... ORDER BY` to find the average durations of app transactions, showing the top 10 (default limit) highest durations by apps which have the highest response size. In this case, if `FACET ... ORDER BY` is not used, the query results will instead show the top 10 by highest durations, with response size being irrelevant to the app selection.

    ```sql
    FROM Transaction SELECT average(duration) TIMESERIES FACET appName ORDER BY max(responseSize)
    ```

    <Callout variant="tip">
      Because the operations are performed before the `LIMIT` clause is applied, `FACET ... ORDER BY` does not impact the sort of the final query results, which will be particularly noticeable in the results for non-timeseries queries.
    </Callout>

    <Callout variant="important">
      The `ORDER BY` modifier in this case works differently than the `ORDER BY` clause. When parsing queries that follow the format `FACET attribute1 ORDER BY attribute2`, New Relic will read these as `FACET ... ORDER BY` queries, but only if `ORDER BY` appears immediately after `FACET`. Otherwise `ORDER BY` will be interpreted by New Relic as a clause.

    ```sql

      LIMIT count
      ...
    ```

    Use the `LIMIT` clause to control the maximum number of facet values returned by `FACET` queries or the maximum number of items returned by `SELECT *` queries. This clause takes a single integer value as an argument. If the `LIMIT` clause is not specified, or no value is provided, the limit defaults to 10 for `FACET` queries and 100 in the case of `SELECT *` queries.

    The maximum allowed value for the `LIMIT` clause is 2,000.

        This query shows the top 20 countries by session count and provides 95th percentile of response time for each country for Windows users only.

      ...
    ```

    Use the `OFFSET` clause with `LIMIT` to control the portion of rows returned by `SELECT *` or `SELECT column` queries. Like the `LIMIT` clause, `OFFSET` takes a single integer value as an argument. `OFFSET` sets the number of rows to be skipped before the selected rows of your query are returned. This is constrained by `LIMIT`.

    `OFFSET` rows are skipped starting from the most recent record.

    For example, the query `SELECT interestingValue FROM Minute_Report LIMIT 5 OFFSET 1` returns the last 5 values from `Minute_Report` except for the most recent one.

    This query orders transactions by duration.

    ```sql
    SELECT ...
      SINCE [numerical units AGO | phrase]
      ...
    ```

    The **default** value is **1 hour ago**.

    Use the `SINCE` clause to define the beginning of a time range for the returned data. You can specify a time zone for the query but not for the results. NRQL results are based on your system time.

    When using NRQL, you can set a UTC timestamp or a relative time range:

    * Timestamps use the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS ZZZZ`. For instance:
      ```sql
      FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) SINCE '2021-12-25 00:00:00 +0000' UNTIL '2021-12-25 23:59:59 +0000'
      ```
    * We support the following relative time ranges: `YESTERDAY`, `TODAY`, `SUNDAY`, `MONDAY`, `TUESDAY`, `WEDNESDAY`, `THURSDAY`, `FRIDAY`, `SATURDAY`. For example, `SINCE YESTERDAY UNTIL NOW`.
    * We also support `YEAR`, `QUARTER`, `MONTH`, `WEEK`, `DAY`, `HOUR`, `MINUTE`, `SECOND`. For these cases, you can combine `SINCE` with `THIS` or `LAST`. For instance, `SINCE LAST MONTH UNTIL THIS WEEK`. You can also include `AGO`, as in `SINCE 3 WEEKS AGO UNTIL 10 MINUTES AGO`.

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="slide-by"
    title={<><InlineCode>SLIDE BY</InlineCode> clause</>}
  >
    The `SLIDE BY` clause supports a feature known as sliding windows. With sliding windows,`SLIDE BY` data is gathered into "windows" of time that overlap with each other. These windows can help to smooth out line graphs with a lot of variation in cases where the rolling aggregate (such as a rolling mean) is more important than aggregates from narrow windows of time.

    To use `SLIDE BY`, place it in a query after the `TIMESERIES` clause. For example, this query pulls data in 5-minute windows with a 1-minute `SLIDE BY` interval, meaning that each window lasts 5 minutes, but window 1 starts at 0 minutes, window 2 starts at 1 minute, window 3 starts at 2 minutes, and so on.

    ```sql
    SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY 1 minute
    ```

    To learn more about how and when you can use `SLIDE BY`, see [Create smoother charts with sliding windows](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-tutorials/create-smoother-charts-sliding-windows). Or, watch this short video (approx. 3:20 minutes).

        title={<>Use <InlineCode>SLIDE BY</InlineCode> with <InlineCode>MAX</InlineCode> or <InlineCode>AUTO</InlineCode> interval</>}
      >
        You can use sliding windows in combination with `MAX` or `AUTO`. However, `MAX` or `AUTO` may not be placed between `TIMESERIES` and `SLIDE BY`.

        This query will automatically decide a `SLIDE BY` window interval.

        ```sql
        SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY AUTO
        ```

        This query will set the SLIDE BY window to the maximum interval granularity.

        ```sql
        SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction TIMESERIES 5 minutes SLIDE BY MAX
        ```

        <Callout variant="important">
          The `SLIDE BY` value as determined by `AUTO` or `MAX` can produce a step interval greater than the window size, which can cause gaps and unexpected results.

  >
    ```sql
    SELECT ...
      TIMESERIES integer units
      ...
    ```

    Use the `TIMESERIES` clause to return data as a time series broken out by a specified period of time. Since `TIMESERIES` is used to trigger certain charts, there is no default value.

    To indicate the time range, use `integer units`. For example:

    * `TIMESERIES 1 minute`
    * `TIMESERIES 30 minutes`
    * `TIMESERIES 1 hour`
    * `TIMESERIES 30 seconds`

    `TIMESERIES` can be combined with arguments such as `MAX`, `AUTO`, and `SLIDE BY` to further tailor query results, as shown in the examples below.

    <Callout variant="important">
      For functions such as `average()` or `percentile()`, a large aggregation window can have a significant smoothing effect on outliers. This is true whether or not the query makes use of sliding windows.
    </Callout>

        id="set-interval"
        title="Use a set interval"
      >
        The value provided indicates the units used to break out the graph. For example, to present a one-day graph showing 30 minute increments:

        ```sql
        SELECT ... SINCE 1 day AGO TIMESERIES 30 minutes
        ```
      </Collapser>

      <Collapser
        id="timeseries-auto"
        title="Use an automatically set interval"
      >
        `TIMESERIES` can also be set to `AUTO`, which will divide your graph into a reasonable number of divisions. For example, a daily chart will be divided into 30 minute intervals and a weekly chart will be divided into 6 hour intervals.

        This query returns data as a line chart showing the 50th and 90th percentile of client-side transaction time for one week with a data point every 6 hours.

        ```sql
        SELECT average(duration), percentile(duration, 50, 90)
          FROM PageView SINCE 1 week AGO TIMESERIES AUTO
        ```
      </Collapser>

      <Collapser
        id="timeseries-max"
        title={<>Use <InlineCode>MAX</InlineCode> interval</>}
      >
        You can set `TIMESERIES` to `MAX`, which will automatically adjust your time window to the maximum number of intervals allowed for a given time period. This allows you to update your time windows without having to manually update your `TIMESERIES` buckets and ensures your time window is being split into the peak number of intervals allowed. The maximum number of `TIMESERIES` buckets that will be returned is 366.

        For example, the following query creates 4-minute intervals, which is the ceiling for a daily chart.

        ```sql
        SELECT average(duration) FROM Transaction since 1 day ago TIMESERIES MAX
        ```

  >
    ```sql
    SELECT ...
      UNTIL integer units AGO
      ...
    ```

    The **default** value is **NOW**. Only use `UNTIL` to specify an end point other than the default.

    Use the `UNTIL` clause to define the end of a time range across which to return data. Once a time range has been specified, the data will be preserved and can be reviewed after the time range has ended.

    Use the `WHERE` clause to filter results. NRQL returns the results that fulfill the condition(s) you specify in the clause.

      WHERE attribute [operator 'value' | IN ('value' [, 'value']) | IS [NOT] NULL ]
      [AND|OR ...]
      ...
    ```

    * If you specify more than one condition, separate the conditions by the operators `AND` or `OR`.
    * If you want to [simulate a SQL `JOIN`](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/using-nrql/simulate-sql-join-functions-insights), use custom attributes in a `WHERE` or `FACET` clause.

            Values must be in parentheses, separated by commas. For example:

          <td>
            Determines if an attribute contains a specified sub-string.

            The string argument for the `LIKE` operator accepts the percent sign (%) as a wildcard anywhere in the string. If the substring does not begin or end the string you are matching against, the wildcard must begin or end the string.

            **Examples:**

Use the `WITH ... AS` clause to define NRQL variables to store values as variables that can be referenced anywhere in the query. Some rules and tips:

* The `WITH ... AS` clause can go before, in between, or directly after the `FROM`/`SELECT` clause
* Only row-wise functions (for example, `capture()`) can be set as a variable. Aggregator functions, such as `average()`, are not supported.
* Only one `WITH` can be used, but you can use multiple NRQL variables as long as they're separated by a comma.
* If a defined NRQL variable uses the same name as an existing attribute, the variable will take precedence.
* Variable names cannot include the `%` symbol.

    ```sql
    SELECT ... WITH TIMEZONE (selected zone)

    Use the `WITH TIMEZONE` clause to select a time zone for a date or time in the query that hasn't already had a time zone specified for it.

    If you include the `WITH TIMEZONE` clause without specifying a time zone in a date time, the `since` and `until` clauses keep in the provided time zone.

    If you don't include the `WITH TIMEZONE` clause, but you include a time zone in a date time string, your date time string time zone keeps.

    <Callout variant="important">
      The default time zone is always UTC if one is not specified. The raw timestamp values (as seen in the JSON view) in the results are always UTC. The UI displays the results in the time zone you've specified in your account settings.
      A time zone in a time stamp string always works. It supersedes the `WITH TIMEZONE` zone.
    </Callout>

    For example, the query clause `SINCE Monday UNTIL Tuesday WITH TIMEZONE 'America/New_York'` returns data recorded from Monday at midnight, America/New York time, until midnight Tuesday, America/New York time.

    Here are some examples of query timespan clauses:

    * No time zone in date time string using the `WITH TIMEZONE` clause:

      ```sql
      SINCE today UNTIL '2022-05-19T12:00' WITH TIMEZONE 'America/Los_Angeles'
      ```
      This resolves as `"beginTime": "2022-05-19T07:00:00Z"` and `"endTime": "2022-05-19T19:00:00Z"`.

    * Time zone in date time string, not using the `WITH TIMEZONE` clause:

      ```sql
      SINCE today UNTIL '2022-05-19T12:00-0500'
      ```
      This resolves as `"beginTime": "2022-05-19T00:00:00Z"` and `"endTime": "2022-05-19T17:00:00Z"`.

    * Time zone in date time string, using the `WITH TIMEZONE` clause America/Los Angeles, which is -0700 during daylight saving time:

      ```sql
      SINCE today UNTIL '2022-05-19T12:00-0500' WITH TIMEZONE 'America/Los_Angeles'
      ```
      This resolves as `"beginTime": "2022-05-19T07:00:00Z"` and `"endTime": "2022-05-19T19:00:00Z"`.

## Query metric data [#query-metrics]

Metric data is more complex than other types of data. There are specific tips for querying it well. We have two types of metric data, each with their own query guidelines:

* [Query dimensional metrics](/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/metric-api/view-query-you-metric-data), which are reported by our Metric API and by some of our solutions that use that API (for example, our [Dropwizard integration](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/dropwizard/dropwizard-reporter) or [Micrometer integration](/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/micrometer/micrometer-metrics-registry)).
* [Query metric timeslice data](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-tutorials/query-metric-timeslice-data-nrql), which is our original metric data type reported by our APM, mobile monitoring, and browser monitoring.

For more details about how we report metric data, see [Metric data types](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#metrics).

## Functions [#functions]

In this section we explain NRQL functions, both [aggregator functions](#aggregator-functions) and [non-aggregator functions](#non-aggregator-functions).

### Aggregator functions [#aggregator-functions]

You can use aggregator functions to filter and aggregate data. Some tips for using these:

* See New Relic University tutorials for [Filter queries](http://newrelic.wistia.com/medias/8k4xbxlfwj), [Apdex queries](http://newrelic.wistia.com/medias/46dvx1mkm0), and [Percentile queries](http://newrelic.wistia.com/medias/j3htrz66l0). Or, go to the full online course [Writing NRQL queries](https://learn.newrelic.com/writing-nrql-queries).
* If you're using an aggregator function multiple times in the same query (for example, `SELECT median(one_metric), median(another_metric)`), it can cause problems in displaying results. To solve this, use the [`AS` function](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#sel-as). For example:
  ```sql
   SELECT median(one_metric) as 'med-a', median(another_metric) as 'med-b'
  ```
* Data type "coercion" is not supported. Read about [available type conversion functions](#type-conversion).
* For how to display results over time, see [Group results over time](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/features/cohort-analysis).

Examples:

```sql
SELECT histogram(duration, 10, 20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 week ago
```

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="func-aggregationendtime"
    title={<InlineCode>aggregationendtime()</InlineCode>}
  >
    Use the `aggregationendtime()` function to return the time of the relevant aggregation. More specifically, for a given aggregate, the `aggregationendtime()` function provides the timestamp of the end of the time period of that aggregation. For example, in a timeseries query, for a data point that encompasses an hour’s worth of data, the function would return the timestamp of the end of that hour period.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="func-apdex"
    title={<InlineCode>apdex(attribute, t: )</InlineCode>}
  >
    Use the `apdex` function to return an [Apdex score](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction#score) for a single transaction or for all your transactions. The [attribute](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/decorating-events/insights-attributes) can be any attribute based on response time, such as [`duration`](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-events-attributes/apm-default-event-attributes#txn-duration) or [`backendDuration`](/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/default-events-attributes/browser-default-events-attributes-insights#backend-duration). The `t:` argument defines an [Apdex T](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction) threshold in the same unit of time as the chosen attribute. For instance, if the attribute is measured in seconds, `t` will be a threshold in seconds.

    The Apdex score returned by the `apdex()` function is based only on execution time. It does not account for APM errors. If a transaction includes an error but completes in [Apdex T](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/getting-started/glossary#apdex_t) or less, that transaction will be rated [satisfying](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction#bullet-satisfied) by the `apdex ()` function.

    <CollapserGroup>
      <Collapser
        id="apdex-cust-attributes"
        title="Get Apdex for specific customers"
      >
        If you have [defined custom attributes](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/decorating-events/insights-custom-attributes), you can filter based on those attributes. For example, you could monitor the Apdex for a particularly important customer:

        ```sql
        SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.4) FROM Transaction
          WHERE customerName='ReallyImportantCustomer' SINCE 1 day ago
        ```
      </Collapser>

      <Collapser
        id="apdex-transaction"
        title="Get Apdex for specific transaction"
      >
        Use the `name` attribute to return a score for a specific transaction, or return an overall Apdex by omitting `name`. This query returns an Apdex score for the **Controller/notes/index** transaction over the last hour:

        <img
          title="crop-apdex-function"
          alt="crop-apdex-function"
          src={queriesnrqlApdexNRQLQueryBuilder}
        />

        <figcaption>
          The `apdex` function returns an [Apdex score](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measuring-user-satisfaction) that measures user satisfaction with your site. Arguments are a response time attribute and an Apdex T threshold in seconds.
        </figcaption>

        ```sql
        SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.5) from Transaction
        WHERE name='Controller/notes/index' SINCE 1 hour ago
        ```
      </Collapser>

      <Collapser title="Get overall Apdex for your app">
        This example query returns an overall Apdex for the application over the last three weeks:

        ```sql
        SELECT apdex(duration, t: 0.08) FROM Transaction SINCE 3 week ago
        ```

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="func-average"
    title={<InlineCode>average(attribute)</InlineCode>}
  >
    Use the `average()` function to return the average value for an attribute. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="func-buckets"
    title={<InlineCode>buckets(attribute, ceiling [,number of buckets])</InlineCode>}
  >
    Use the `buckets()` function to aggregate data split up by a `FACET` clause into buckets based on ranges. You can bucket by any attribute that is stored as a numerical value in the New Relic database.

    It takes three arguments:

    * Attribute name
    * Maximum value of the sample range. Any outliers will appear in the final bucket.
    * Total number of buckets

      For more information and examples, see [Split your data into buckets](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-examples/segment-your-insights-data-buckets).
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="func-bucket-percentile"
    title={<InlineCode>bucketPercentile(attribute)</InlineCode>}
  >
    The `bucketPercentile()` function is the NRQL equivalent of the [`histogram_quantile`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/functions/#histogram_quantile) function in Prometheus. It is intended to be used with dimensional metric data. Instead of the quantile, New Relic returns the percentile, which is the quantile \* 100.

    Use the `bucketPercentile()` function to calculate the quantile from the histogram data in a Prometheus format.

    It takes the bucket name as an argument and reports percentiles along the bucket's boundaries:

    ```sql
    SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago
    ```

    Optionally, you can add percentile specifications as an argument:

    ```sql
    SELECT bucketPercentile(duration_bucket, 50, 75, 90) FROM Metric SINCE 1 day ago
    ```

    Because multiple metrics are used to make up Prometheus histogram data, you must query for specific Prometheus metrics in terms of the associated `<basename>`.

    For example, to compute percentiles from a Prometheus histogram, with the `<basename>` `prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds` using NRQL, use `bucketPercentile(prometheus_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket, 50)`. Note how \_bucket is added to the end of the `<basename>` as a suffix.

    See [the Prometheus.io documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram) for more information.

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="func-cardinality"
    title={<InlineCode>cardinality(attribute)</InlineCode>}
  >
    Use the `cardinality()` function to obtain the number of combinations of all the dimensions (attributes) on a [metric](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#metrics).

    It takes three arguments, all optional:

    * Metric name: if present, `cardinality()` only computes the metric specified.
    * Include: if present, the include list restricts the cardinality computation to those attributes.
    * Exclude: if present, the exclude list causes those attributes to be ignored in the cardinality computation.

      ```sql
      SELECT cardinality(metric_name, include:{attribute_list}, exclude:{attribute_list})
      ```
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="func-count"
    title={<InlineCode>count(*)</InlineCode>}
  >
    Use the `count()` function to return a count of available records. It takes a single argument; either `*`, an attribute, or a constant value. Currently, it follows typical SQL behavior and counts all records that have values for its argument.

    Since `count(*)` does not name a specific attribute, the results will be formatted in the default ["humanize"](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/managing-dashboards-data/data-formatter-setting-default-formats-numeric-values#format) format.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="derivative"
    title={<InlineCode>derivative(attribute [,time interval])</InlineCode>}
  >
    `derivative()` finds the rate of change for a given dataset. The rate of change is calculated using a linear least-squares regression to approximate the derivative. Since this calculation requires comparing more than one datapoint, if only one datapoint is included in the evaluation range, the calculation is indeterminate and won't work, resulting in a `null` value.

    The `time interval` is the period for which the rate of change is calculated. For example, `derivative(attributeName, 1 minute)` will return the rate of change per minute.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="func-dimensions"
    title={<InlineCode>{'dimensions(include: {attributes}, exclude: {attributes})'}</InlineCode>}
  >
    Use the `dimensions()` function to return all the dimensional values on a data type.

    You can explicitly include or exclude specific attributes using the optional arguments:

    * Include: if present, the include list limits `dimensions()` to those attributes.
    * Exclude: if present, the `dimensions()` calculation ignores those attributes.

      ```sql
      FROM Metric SELECT count(node_filesystem_size) TIMESERIES FACET dimensions()
      ```

      When used with a `FACET` clause, `dimensions()` produces a unique timeseries for all facets available on the event type, similar to how Prometheus behaves with non-aggregated queries.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="latestrate"
    title={<InlineCode>latestrate(attribute, time interval)</InlineCode>}
  >
    Use the `latestrate()` function to return the rate of change of a value based on the last 2 data points. It takes the attribute in question as the first argument and the unit of time for the resulting rate as the second argument. The function returns a result in units of `change in attribute/time interval`.

    This function can be useful to provide the most recent rate of change for an attribute in order to see leading-edge trends.

    <CollapserGroup>
      <Collapser title="Get the most recent rate of change of PageView Duration">
        This query returns the rate of change of duration based on the last 2 data points. It will be returned in units of `duration/second` because of the `1 SECOND` argument.

        ```sql
        SELECT latestrate(duration, 1 SECOND) FROM PageView
        ```
      </Collapser>
    </CollapserGroup>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="func-max"
    title={<InlineCode>max(attribute)</InlineCode>}
  >
    Use the `max()` function to return the maximum recorded value of a numeric attribute over the time range specified. It takes a single attribute name as an argument. If a value of the attribute is not numeric, it will be ignored when aggregating. If data matching the query's conditions is not found, or there are no numeric values returned by the query, it will return a value of null.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="func-median"

    `predictLinear()` is an extension of the `derivative()` function. It uses a similar method of least-squares linear regression to predict the future values for a dataset.

    * The `time interval` is how far the query will look into the future. For example, `predictLinear(attributeName, 1 hour)` is a linear prediction 1 hour into the future of the query time window.
    * Generally, `predictLinear()` is helpful for continuously growing values like disk space, or predictions on large trends.
    * Since `predictLinear()` is a linear regression, familiarity with the dataset being queried helps to ensure accurate long-term predictions.
    * Any dataset which grows exponentially, logarithmically, or by other nonlinear means will likely only be successful in very short-term predictions.
    * New Relic recommends against using `predictLinear` in `TIMESERIES` queries. This is because each bucket will be making an individual prediction based on its relative timeframe within the query, meaning that such queries will not show predictions from the end of the timeseries forward.

    * Use [`TIMESERIES`](#sel-timeseries) to generate a line chart with rates mapped over time.
    * Omit [`TIMESERIES`](#sel-timeseries) to generate a billboard showing a single rate value averaged over time.

      Here's a basic query that will generate a line chart showing the rate of throughput for APM transactions per 10 minutes over the past 6 hours:

    Use the `uniques()` function to return a list of unique values recorded for an attribute over the time range specified. When used along with the `facet` clause, a list of unique attribute values will be returned per each facet value.

    The `limit` parameter is optional. When it is not provided, the default limit of 1,000 unique attribute values per facet is applied. You may specify a different `limit` value, up to a maximum of 10,000. The `uniques()` function will return the first set of unique attribute values discovered, until the limit is reached. Therefore, if you have 5,000 unique attribute values in your data set, and the limit is set to 1,000, the operator will return the first 1,000 unique values that it discovers, regardless of their frequency.

    The maximum number of values that can be returned in a query result is the product of the `uniques()` limit times the `facet` limit. In the following query, the theoretical maximum number of values that can be returned is 5 million (5,000 x 1,000).

    Depending on the data set being queried, and the complexity of the query, memory protection limits may prevent a very large query from being executed.

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="func-aparse"
    title={<><InlineCode>aparse(attribute, pattern)</InlineCode></>}
  >
Use the anchor parse function, `aparse()` to extract specific values from a string. This is an alternative to `capture()`.

`aparse()` takes two arguments:
* A string attribute
* A pattern string with anchor strings and extract characters, e.g. 'www.*.com' to extract the domain from a URL.

When using `aparse()`, the pattern string should contain anchors, like 'www.' and '.com' above, to identify the location of the intended extracted string, noted by '*'.

`aparse()` uses the following characters in pattern strings:
* '%' - Non-capturing wildcard, as you'd see in the `LIKE` clause
* '*' - Capturing wildcard, similar to using regex capture

In practice, the anchor strings often occur in the middle of a string attribute, and not at the beginning or end.

In this case, use the '%' wildcard to ignore unwanted values: for example, '%www.*.com%'.

Like `capture()`, all results from `aparse()` are strings. To use these results in math functions they must cast with the `numeric()` function.

Note: `aparse()` is case-insensitive.

    <CollapserGroup>
      <Collapser title="Basic use" id="aparse-basic" className="freq-link">
        ```sql

      <Collapser title={<><InlineCode>aparse()</InlineCode> specific values</>} id="aparse-specific-values" className="freq-link">
        To extract a value from the middle of a string, use the non-capturing wildcard, '%', at the beginning and end of the pattern string. For example:

        ```sql
        FROM Log
          SELECT count(*)
          FACET aparse(string, '%"itemId":"*"%')

    Use the `concat()` function to return the string resulting from concatenating its arguments.

    Up to 20 arguments of numeric, boolean, tuple, or array types may be provided. Null arguments and arguments of unsupported types are ignored. If no arguments are provided, the result is the empty string.

    The optional precision argument may be provided in order to limit the number of decimal places included when concatenating floating-point numeric values.

    The resulting string may have a maximum length of 4096 characters.

    title={<InlineCode>capture(attribute, regular expression)</InlineCode>}

    Use `capture()` to extract values from an attribute using a regular expression with [RE2 syntax](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax).

    It takes two arguments:
    * Attribute name.
    * Regular expression with capture syntax. Regex expressions in NRQL use Python-like syntax, `r'...'`.

    When capturing, use the RE2 named-capture syntax `...(?P<name> pattern )...` to capture the contained pattern, given the specified name.

    Multiple values can be captured by specifying additional capture groups in a regular expression. For example: `...(?P<name1> pattern1)...(?P<name2> pattern2)...`

    Note: When capturing multiple values, each capture statement can have up to 16 capture groups, and each NRQL query can have up to 5 capture statements.

    Read how to [use regex capture to improve your query results](https://newrelic.com/blog/how-to-relic/using-regex-capture).

    <Callout variant="tip">
      The regular expression must match its entire input. If a capture expression is not extracting the expected results, check whether it needs `.*` at the beginning or end, which is the pattern for a partial match regex. However, the partial match regex may cause a slower query execution.

  Use the `position()` function to find the location of a substring within a string.

  Arguments:
  * str - the string in which to find the substring.
    * This can be anything that evaluates to a string, including a literal string in quotes, a queried string attribute, a function that returns a string, or even a subquery that returns a single string value.
  * substr - the string for which to search within str.
  * occurrence - indicates which occurrence of substr of which to return the position.
    * _Default:_ 0
    * If positive, find the nth occurrence of the substr from the beginning of str, zero based
    * If negative, find the nth occurrence of the substr from the end of str. The last occurrence of substr would be the -1 occurrence.

  Alias: <InlineCode>indexOf(str, substr [, occurrence])</InlineCode> - `indexOf()` is an alternative name for the `position()` function

  Returns:
    * The 0-based index of the starting character of the substr within str
    * If the referenced occurrence of substr is not found, -1 is returned
    * Return null if str or substr is null
    * Searches are case-sensitive

    Use the `substring()` function to extract a portion of a string.

    Arguments:
    * str - the string from which to extract a substring.
      * This can be anything that evaluates to a string, including a literal string in quotes, a queried string attribute, a function that returns a string, or even a subquery that returns a single string value.
      * If this argument evaluates to null, the `substring()` function will return null.
    * start - the position within str from which to begin the extraction.
      * The first character in str is position 0.
      * A negative value will find the position relative to the end of str, with the last character of the string being position -1.
      * If start is larger or equal to the length of str, the `substring()` function will return an empty string.
      * If start is negative, and its absolute value is larger than the length of str, the extracted substring will begin at position 0.
    * length - the length, or number of characters, of the substring to extract from str.
      * _Optional_ - if length is not provided, all characters in str after the resolved start position will be included.

## Type conversion

NRQL does not support "coercion." This means that a float stored as a string is treated as a string and cannot be operated on by functions expecting float values.

You can convert a string with a numeric value or a boolean with a string value to their numeric and boolean equivalents, or convert a non-string value to a string value, with these functions:

* Use the `numeric()` function to convert a number with a string format to a numeric value. The function can be built into a query that uses math functions on query results or NRQL aggregator functions, such as `average()`.
* Use the `boolean()` function to convert a string value of `"true"` or `"false"` to the corresponding boolean value.
* Use the `string()` function to convert a numeric, boolean, tuple, or array value to a string value.  See [`string()`](#func-string) above for more information.
