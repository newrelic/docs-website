Our New Relic query language, NRQL, has rate limits in place to ensure a high level of availability and reliability for all users. 

## Understand query limit violations [#limit-violations]

To see if you're hitting query-related limits, use the [Limits UI](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/view-system-limits/). 

You should rarely encounter rate limiting. Here are some guidelines to follow to ensure query limiting will be rare:

* Limit the number complex queries (for example, queries with `FACET` or `TIMESERIES` clauses, or queries of over a million events) that run at the same time.
* Limit the number of queries running concurrently over extended periods of time to a maximum of five, especially if they include complex queries.

## NRQL query limits [#query-limits]

There are a few different NRQL query limits: 

* Number of queries an account can make in a given time range
* Number of data points an account can query (inspect) in a given time range
* How long a query can run for before being considered an error and stopping 

Note that these limits apply only to customer-initiated NRQL queries, such as queries using the query builder, queries used in custom charts and dashboards, and NRQL queries done with our NerdGraph API. These limits don't apply to queries used in pre-built, "out-of-the-box" New Relic charts and dashboards. 

### Limits on number of queries [#query-count-limits]

The limit on NRQL queries is 3,000 queries per account per minute. When this limit is exceeded, queries may be rejected until the number of queries sent per minute no longer exceeds the limit. 

This limit is only applicable to the NRQL Query API requests and not the queries run from the query builder, New Relic UI, or custom dashboards. The limits that govern the rate of resource consumption for this category of queries run on the New Relic UI, query builder, or customer dashboards are only the Inspected count limits.

### Limits on number of data points inspected [#inspected-count-limits]

When you run a NRQL query, it displays the number of data points inspected, as shown below:

<img
  title="New Relic inspected event count"
  alt="New Relic inspected event count"
  src={eventCountModal}
/>

In this context, the "events" term is used in a general sense to refer to all [NRQL-available data points](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql#what-you-can-query) that are inspected in a query.

Every New Relic account has limits on the total number of data points that can be inspected in a given time range. These limits vary depending on which [data option](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing#data-prices) you have: 

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="data-plus"
    title="Data Plus"
  >

The [Data Plus](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing#data-prices) option includes these query limits: 

* Inspected data points per minute: 100 billion
* Inspected data points per 30 minutes: one trillion

</Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="original-data"
    title="Original data option"
  >

For our [original data option](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing#data-prices), limits on inspected data points are: 

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "200px" }}>
        **Time period**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Limit**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Rolling 30 minutes
      </td>

      <td>
        300 billion data points inspected (equivalent to a sustained rate of 10 billion data points inspected per minute)
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        24 hours
      </td>

      <td>
        7.2 trillion data points inspected
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
    
</Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

The following are features and actions that count towards the inspected count limit and that are impacted when the limit is reached. When the count drops below the limit in the next time period, restrictions are removed.

* Custom queries run by a New Relic user
* Widgets on custom dashboards that run queries
* Curated views that load due to an action initiated by a user (for example, when a user loads the APM **Summary**, APM **Transactions**, **Distributed tracing**, browser **Summary**, and other pages that return [NRDB](/docs/data-apis/get-started/nrdb-horsepower-under-hood) data)
* Alert condition evaluation and notifications do **not** count towards the limit but the links to New Relic that are included in an alert notification do

### Query duration limit [#query-duration]

The query duration limit is how long a NRQL query can run before it stops running. This limit depends on your [data option](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing#data-prices): 

* Original data option: 1 minute
* Data Plus: 
  * 2 minutes with regular NRQL query
  * 10 minutes using [asynchronous query](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/async-queries-nrql-tutorial)
