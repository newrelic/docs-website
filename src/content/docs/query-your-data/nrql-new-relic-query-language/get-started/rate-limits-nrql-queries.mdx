Our [New Relic query language](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language), NRQL, has rate limits in place to ensure a high level of availability and reliability for all our users. 

## Understand query limit breaches [#limit-breaches]

To see if you're hitting query-related limits, use the [Limits UI](/docs/data-apis/manage-data/view-system-limits/). 

You should rarely encounter limits on your NRQL queries. Here are some guidelines to follow to ensure query limiting will be rare:

* Limit the number of complex queries (for example, queries with `FACET` or `TIMESERIES` clauses, or queries of over a million events) that run at the same time.
* Limit the number of queries running concurrently over extended periods of time to a maximum of five, especially if they include complex queries.

## NRQL query limits [#query-limits]

There are a few different NRQL query limits: 

* Number of data points you can query in a given time range
* How long a query can run before erroring and stopping
* Number of queries you can make in a given time range

Next, we'll go into more detail on these limits.  

### Limits on inspected data points [#inspected-count-limits]

When a NRQL query is run, either due to a customer-initiative query or to a UI page load, that query inspects a certain number of data points in our NRDB data base. 

For example, when you run a NRQL query, it displays the number of data points inspected, as shown below:

<img
  title="New Relic inspected event count"
  alt="New Relic inspected event count"
  src={queriesnrqlEventCountinQueryBuilder}
/>
<figcaption> In this case, `events` is used in a general sense to refer to all [NRQL-available data points](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql#what-you-can-query) inspected in a query.
  </figcaption>

The inspected count limit represents how many data points you can query in a specific range of time. These limits differ depending on which [data option](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing#data-prices) you have: 

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="data-plus"
    title="Data Plus"
  >

The [Data Plus](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing#data-prices) option includes these limits on inspected data points: 

* 34B per minute
* 500B per 15 minutes
* 1T per 30 minutes

</Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="original-data"
    title="Original data option"
  >

Limits on inspected data points for our [original data option](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing#data-prices):

* 10B per minutes
* 150B per 15 minutes
* 300B per 30 minutes
    
</Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

### What counts towards inspected count? [#what-counts-inspected-count]

The following actions count towards the inspected count limit for your New Relic account:

* Loads of curated views initiated by a user (for example, when you load an <InlinePopover type="apm" /> UI page, the distributed tracing UI, or any UI that returns data about your organization).
* Custom queries run by a New Relic user, whether in the UI or via API.
* Loading widgets that run queries on custom dashboards

Alert condition evaluation and notifications do **not** count towards the limit but the links to New Relic that are included in an alert notification do.

When the inspected count limit is reached, the features mentioned are affected. When the count drops below the limit in the next time period, any restrictions are removed.




## Query duration limit [#query-duration]

The query duration limit is how long a NRQL query can run before it stops running. This limit depends on your [data option](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing#data-prices): 

* Original data option: 1 minute
* Data Plus: 
  * 2 minutes with regular NRQL query
  * 10 minutes using [asynchronous query](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/async-queries-nrql-tutorial)

## Limits on number of queries [#query-count-limits]

This limit only applies for NRQL queries run via our APIs, and doesn't apply to queries run from the UI. 

This limit is 3,000 queries per account per minute. When this limit is exceeded, queries may be rejected until the number of queries sent per minute no longer exceeds the limit.
