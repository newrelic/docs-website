The refresh rate of New Relic charts is the range of the query's timeframe divided by 60. The maximum frequency with which queries can be refreshed is every 5 seconds.

For example:

* A query with a 7-day time range would have a refresh rate of once every 2.8 hours.
* A query with a 1-hour time range would have a refresh rate of once every 1 minute.

For queries using `TIMESERIES`, the size of the `TIMESERIES` bucket is used as the refresh interval. For example:

* `SELECT count(*) FROM PageView TIMESERIES 5 minutes` would refresh every 5 minutes.
* `SELECT count(*) FROM PageView TIMESERIES 1 hour SINCE 1 day ago` would refresh every hour.
