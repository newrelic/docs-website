The refresh rate of New Relic charts is the number of times per second that a chart is refreshed. You can select a default configuration, and you can also configure this refresh rate if your account is on the [New Relic Compute](https://newrelic.com/pricing/compute) consumption pricing plan. See [How New Relic pricing works](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/) for more information.

This configuration lets you decide how often you want to update your data. It also gives you control over your costs. See the [Overview of our pricing models](/docs/accounts/original-accounts-billing/original-product-based-pricing/overview-pricing-models/#determine-pricing) to learn more.

## Default chart refresh rates [#default-chart-refresh]

The refresh rate of New Relic charts is the range of the query timeframe divided by 60. The maximum frequency at which queries can be refreshed is every 5 seconds.

These examples will help you understand how the default chart refresh rate works:

* A query with a 7-day time range would have a refresh rate of once every 2.8 hours.
* A query with a 1-hour time range would have a refresh rate of once every 1 minute.

For queries using `TIMESERIES`, the size of the `TIMESERIES` bucket is used as the refresh interval. For example:

* `SELECT count(*) FROM PageView TIMESERIES 5 minutes` would refresh every 5 minutes.
* `SELECT count(*) FROM PageView TIMESERIES 1 hour SINCE 1 day ago` would refresh every hour.


## Customize chart refresh rates [#customize-chart-refresh]

You can customize the rate of refresh in your charts by using the <DNT>**Refresh rate**</DNT> option. To configure the refresh rate in a chart, follow these steps:

1. Go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Query your data**</DNT>.

2. Add your query.

3. Click <DNT>**Run**</DNT>.

4. Click <DNT>**Refresh rate**</DNT> and select a frequency.
