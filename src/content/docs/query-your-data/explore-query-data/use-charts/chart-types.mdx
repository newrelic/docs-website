When building a query using the [query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder/), there are a variety of types of visualizations for presenting your data in the optimal format.

This table contains all chart types. Whether a chart type is available for your query will be dependent on:

* The type of query (some query results don't match some chart types)
* The query mode (basic or advanced)

## Area chart [#widget-areachart]

An area chart shows a time series for a single attribute.

<img
  title="An area chart type example that shows average CPU usage."
  alt="A screenshot of an area chart type example that shows average CPU usage."
  src="/images/queries-nrql_screenshot-crop_area-type-chart.webp"
/>

<figcaption>
  The area chart type shows a time series for a single attribute.
</figcaption>

To enable an area chart, add a [`FACET`](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference/nrql-syntax-components-functions#sel-facet) to your query.

You can use facet to add up to five attributes, separated by commas. Use the [`TIMESERIES`](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference/nrql-syntax-components-functions#sel-timeseries) function when you use a `FACET` in an NRQL query.

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Use an area chart when you want to
      </td>

      <td>
        View the measurement of a single attribute over a period of time that you specify.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Avoid an area chart when you want to
      </td>

      <td>
        View a chart that contains more than a single attribute. The [line chart type](#widget-linechart) is a good option; you can view multiple attributes over a time range that you specify. The [bar chart type](#widget-barchart) gives you a comparison view between the attributes; it uses a total of each attribute for the time range you choose.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Bar chart [#widget-barchart]

The bar chart shows comparisons among the categories returned in the query results.

<img
  title="A bar chart example that shows a comparison of browser usage."
  alt="A screenshot of a bar chart example that shows a comparison of browser usage."
  src="/images/queries-nrql_screenshot-crop_bar-type-chart.webp"
/>

<figcaption>
  The bar chart compares a related set of values.
</figcaption>

To enable a bar chart, add a [`FACET`](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference/nrql-syntax-components-functions#sel-facet) clause to the query.

You can use `FACET` with up to 5 different attributes, separated by commas.

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Use a bar chart when you want to
      </td>

      <td>
        Create a chart that reports the total count of the data for a category over the specified time range. With the bar chart format, you can easily see the differences between each category.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Avoid a bar chart when you want to
      </td>

      <td>
        Include measurements over a period of time. This chart type isn't available when using a [TIMESERIES](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions#sel-timeseries) clause. The [line chart type](#widget-linechart) is a good option for this visualization.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Billboard [#widget-billboard]

The billboard chart type presents results as a single, highly-visible value. It's an option when your query returns a single number, such as from this query:

```sql
SELECT uniqueCount(session) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago
```

A billboard chart is useful for single-stat queries like the [Apdex](/docs/apm/new-relic-apm/apdex/apdex-measure-user-satisfaction) function. Use billboards to monitor values at a glance.

You can also use billboards to compare a single value across states. For instance, use the [`COMPARE WITH`](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference/nrql-syntax-components-functions#sel-compare) clause to compare the same attribute across two different time frames.

<Callout variant="important">
Billboard charts that use the `COMPARE WITH` clause won't show percentages percentages or render correctly with public chart links, exported images, and PDFs.
</Callout>

To enable the data for a billboard chart, search for a single value. You can view multiple values by adding a facet from the dropdown.

<DNT>**Thresholds**</DNT>

Optionally, you can set **Good**, **Warning**, **Approaching critical**, **Critical**, or **Neutral thresholds** on billboards.

<img
  title="A billboard chart."
  alt="A screenshot of a billboard chart."
  src="/images/queries-nrql_screenshot-crop_billboards-color.webp"
/>

<figcaption>
  The billboard chart displays a single value in an extra-large font, which can help draw attention to a specific value in a busy dashboared. The background color changes based on your thresholds.
</figcaption>

Here are some tips to help you with thresholds:

* For percentages, use a decimalized format. For example, if your threshold is 99.5%, divide by 100 and set the value to 0.995.
* If you want to highlight a chart when a value falls below a given value rather than above it, set the <DNT>**Warning**</DNT> threshold higher than the <DNT>**Critical**</DNT> threshold.

<DNT>**Thresholds per series**</DNT>

Using the **Thresholds per series** option, you can set <DNT>**Good**, **Warning**, **Approaching critical**, **Critical**, or **Neutral**</DNT> thresholds on billboards. Once set, if your service is working correctly, the chart's full box is green. When a threshold is crossed, the chart turns yellow (warning) or red (critical).

    <img
      title="The billboard chart displays a single value in an extra-large font, which can help draw attention to a specific value in a busy dashboared. The background color changes based on your thresholds."
      alt="The billboard chart displays a single value in an extra-large font, which can help draw attention to a specific value in a busy dashboared. The background color changes based on your thresholds."
      src="/images/billboards-combine-1.webp"
    />

<DNT>**Billboard settings**</DNT>

You can configure the following settings for a billboard chart:

- **Visual style**

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>
          Field name
          </th>
          <th>
          Description
          </th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
        Display mode
        </td>
        <td>
        Select the display mode for the billboard chart. You can choose **Auto**, **Value and lable**, **Value only**, **Label only**, or **None**.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
        Alignment
        </td>
        <td>
        Select the alignment for the billboard chart. You can choose **Stacked (Default)** or **Inline**.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>


- **Grid options**

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
        Value size
        </td>
        <td>
        Select the size of the value displayed in the billboard chart.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
        Label size
        </td>
        <td>
        Select the size of the label displayed in the billboard chart.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
        Columns amount
        </td>
        <td>
        Select the number of columns to display in the billboard chart.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

- **Add link**

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>

          </th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
        Url
        </td>
        <td>
        Enter the URL for the link that will be displayed in the billboard chart.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Use a billboard chart when you want to
      </td>

      <td>
        Monitor values, including thresholds for <DNT>**Critical**</DNT> and <DNT>**Warning**</DNT> states, in a large, easy-to-read font.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Avoid a billboard chart type when
      </td>

      <td>
        You want to view data over a period of time. The [line chart type](#widget-linechart) is a better option for viewing data by time.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Bullet chart [#bullet-chart]

Use the bullet chart type to represent progress to a target or goal, called the limit. To use this chart type, run a query that returns a single number, such as:

```sql
SELECT uniqueCount(session) FROM PageView SINCE 1 day ago
```

<img
  title="An example bullet chart that shows the total number of unique pageviews out of a total number of pageviews."
  alt="A screenshot of an example bullet chart that shows the total number of unique pageviews out of a total number of pageviews."
  src="/images/queries-nrql_screenshot-crop_bullet-type-chart.webp"
/>

<figcaption>
  The bullet chart displays a value compared against a limit.
</figcaption>

Bullet defaults to a limit that is twice the resulting query value. To adjust the limit, use the <DNT>**Limit**</DNT> field to enter another number. The bullet will adjust accordingly.

<Callout variant="tip">
  You can only use bullet charts for charts that present a single value. For example, a query using [`COMPARE WITH`](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference/nrql-syntax-components-functions#sel-compare) won't list bullet as an option.
</Callout>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Use a bullet chart when you want to
      </td>

      <td>
        View a chart uses a large, easy-to-read font that helps you view the value quickly.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Avoid a bullet chart when you want to
      </td>

      <td>
        View data that has more than a single value. Bar and line chart types may be better choices in this instance.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Funnel [#funnel]

Use [funnels](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-query-examples/funnels-evaluate-data-series-events) to evaluate a series of related data types that make up the steps toward a specified goal. A funnel allows you to ask, “Of the people that did (A), how many also did (B), and of the people that did (A) and (B), how many also completed (C)?”

<img
  title="An example NRQL funnel query that displays a count of the users who registered for an account, visited a feature-compare page, and upgraded."
  alt="A screenshot of an example NRQL funnel query that displays a count of the users who registered for an account, visited a feature-compare page, and upgraded."
  src="/images/queries-nrql_screenshot-crop_funnel-chart.webp"
/>

<figcaption>
  Sample funnel chart for a shopping site.
</figcaption>

In this example, you want to determine that of all the visitors that viewed the landing page, how many of them:

* Browsed the products.
* Then added one or more products to a shopping cart.
* And finally, purchased the item(s) in the shopping cart.

  Unlike other queries, you must use a [`SELECT`](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference/nrql-syntax-components-functions#state-select) [`funnel()`](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference/nrql-syntax-components-functions#func-funnel) statement in your query; the funnel chart type isn't selectable from any other type of query.

  Additionally, the funnel chart type is only available for queries with eight steps or fewer. A funnel query that includes more than eight steps will only return the results as JSON.

  ```sql
  SELECT funnel(session,
      WHERE pageUrl like '%/index.html' AS 'Landing',
      WHERE pageUrl LIKE '%/browse/phones' AS 'Browse',
      WHERE pageUrl LIKE '%/shoppingcart' AS 'Cart',
      WHERE pageUrl LIKE '%/checkout' AS 'Purchased')
  FROM PageView WHERE appName = 'WebPortal' AND duration < 1
  SINCE 1 week ago
  ```

  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>
          Use a funnel when you want to
        </td>

        <td>
          You want to visually evaluate the paths that visitors take after they hit a page that you designate as a landing page.
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          Avoid a funnel when you want to
        </td>

        <td>
          You only want counts for the attributes in the [`WHERE`](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference/nrql-syntax-components-functions#where-operator) clause. You will not be able to choose funnel unless you use `SELECT funnel` in your query.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

## Heat map [#widget-heatmap]

A heat map is a visualization tool that uses color gradations to represent data frequency across time intervals. This method is effective for quickly interpreting complex data patterns.

<img
  title="An example heatmap chart showing a pageview breakdown by operating system."
  alt="A screenshot of an example heatmap chart showing a pageview breakdown by operating system."
  src="/images/queries-nrql_screenshot-crop_heatmap-chart.webp"
/>

<figcaption>
  The heat map is a faceted distribution of values where color density represents the values displayed.
</figcaption>

Heat maps visually portray histograms by dividing data into segments within a defined range, such as 0 to 10, using color density to reflect frequency.

<DNT>**Facet and TimeSeries in heat map**</DNT>

`Facet` allows categorization of data by attributes such as geographical regions—like Spain, Brazil, or the US—enabling comparisons across different segments. The integration of `TIMESERIES` feature divides the histogram data into equal time buckets, effectively representing it along a timeline similar to line or area, and using color intensity to highlight frequency changes over extended periods.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="example-query-facet"
    title="Query using Facet"
  >

    ```bash
    SELECT histogram(duration, width:10, buckets:20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 month ago FACET countryCode
    ```

    <img
      title="A screenshot of an example heatmap chart showing a pageview breakdown by countryCode"
      alt="A screenshot of an example heatmap chart showing a pageview breakdown by countryCode."
      src="/images/nrql-query-facet-countryCode.webp"
    />
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="example-query-timeseries"
    title="Query using TIMESERIES"
  >

    ```bash
    SELECT histogram(duration, width:10, buckets:20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 month ago TIMESERIES
    ```

    <img
      title="A screenshot of an example heatmap chart showing a pageview breakdown by Timeseries."
      alt="A screenshot of an example heatmap chart showing a pageview breakdown by Timeseries."
      src="/images/nrql-heatmap-TIMESERIES.webp"
    />
  </Collapser>

By integrating `Facet` with `TIMESERIES`, heat maps offer three-dimensional views and utilize tooltips for detailed context, such as country codes.

  <Collapser
    id="example-query-combining"
    title="Query combining Facet and TIMESERIES"
  >

    ```bash
    SELECT histogram(duration, width:10, buckets:20) FROM PageView SINCE 1 month ago TIMESERIES FACET countryCode
    ```
  
    <img
      title="A screenshot of an example heatmap chart showing a pageview breakdown by countryCode."
      alt="A screenshot of an example heatmap chart showing a pageview breakdown by countryCode."
      src="/images/heatmaps-countrycode.webp"
    />
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

To enable a heat map, use the [`Histogram()`](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference/nrql-syntax-components-functions#func-histogram) function with a numeric attribute and use [`FACET`](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference/nrql-syntax-components-functions#sel-facet) to add up to five attributes, separated by commas or use `TIMESERIES` together with the histogram function.

See [Histograms: View data distribution](/docs/using-new-relic/user-interface-functions/view-your-data/histograms-view-data-distribution) for more detailed information about histogram-based charts.

<table style={{ fontSize: "12pt" }}>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Use a heat map when you want to
      </td>

      <td>
        Visualize tabular data with multiple attributes over time using color gradations instead of numeric values.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Avoid a heat map when you want to
      </td>

      <td>
        Obtain precise numerical data for multiple attributes across a period. Consider using line or bar charts for exact numeric representations.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Histogram [#widget-histogram]

<img
  title="An example histogram showing pageview duration over time."
  alt="A screenshot of an example histogram showing pageview duration over time."
  src="/images/crop-insights-histogram-chart.webp"
/>

<figcaption>
  A histogram charts frequency across a series of value ranges.
</figcaption>

Use histograms to show the distribution of data across time buckets. See [Histograms: View data distribution](/docs/using-new-relic/user-interface-functions/view-your-data/histograms-view-data-distribution) for more detailed information about histogram-based charts.

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Use a histogram when you want to
      </td>

      <td>
        Chart frequency of data over a series of values.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Avoid a histogram when you want to
      </td>

      <td>
        View the same data as [heat](#widget-heatmap) [map](#widget-heatmap) or to view the data without the time buckets.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## JSON [#widget-json]

Use the returned JSON to review the raw data returned and to help develop integrations with New Relic. To implement integrations, use [remote queries](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/adding-querying-data/querying-your-data-remotely) to return raw JSON as a service.

To use this, select the <DNT>**Share**</DNT> menu and click <DNT>**Copy JSON**</DNT>.

Example NRQL query:

```sql
SELECT uniqueCount(name) FROM Transaction
WHERE http.statusCode = '200'

## Line [#widget-linechart]

A line chart is useful for spotting trends over time.

When working in basic query mode, select a single attribute you can plot over time.

When using NRQL, [`SELECT`](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#state-select) one or more attributes you can plot over time and then use the [`TIMESERIES`](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference/nrql-syntax-components-functions#sel-timeseries) function.

## Pie chart [#widget-piechart]

A pie chart is the graphic representation of the table. It appears as an option for some functions when the [`FACET`](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference/nrql-syntax-components-functions#sel-facets) clause is used. To use this chart type, run a query that returns one value for each of a set of attributes.

<figcaption>

To enable pie chart, add a [`FACET`](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference/nrql-syntax-components-functions#sel-facet) from the dropdown.

You can add only one `FACET` in basic query mode. If you're using NRQL, you can use `FACET` to add up to 5 attributes, separated by commas, and also include the [`TIMESERIES`](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference/nrql-syntax-components-functions#sel-timeseries) function.

<Callout variant="important">
The following [aggregator functions](/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/using-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference#functions) require a `FACET` clause to be visualized as pie charts: `average`, `apdex`, `min`, `max`, `percentage`, and `percentile`. For example, `SELECT percentile(duration) FROM Transaction FACET appName` is pie compatible, but `SELECT percentile(duration) FROM Transaction` is not.
</Callout>

For `uniqueCount`, percentages [may add up to more than 100%](#pie-percentage-problem).

      <td>
        Create a chart that that graphically presents a set of values as they relate to a whole. A pie chart is effective for displaying values for a time period, for example.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Avoid a pie chart when you want to
      </td>

      <td>
        Present data that does not use values as they related to a whole, such as with line charts.
      </td>

### Pie chart percentage problem [#pie-percentage-problem]

When using a pie chart with the [`uniqueCount`](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-resources/nrql-syntax-components-functions#func-uniqueCount) aggregator function, the percentages can add up to more than 100%. This is because the attributes being uniquely counted may be present in multiple facets. For example, in the query `SELECT uniqueCount(user) FROM PageView FACET appName`, a single unique user may use multiple apps. Each of these users are included in the unique value for each of the appropriate facets (apps), but the total number of unique users won't change.

To solve this, use a [bar chart](#widget-barchart) or [table](#widget-table) to provide a more accurate visualization of `uniqueCount` data.

## Table [#widget-table]

A table is the standard view for a set of values related to a specific attribute (for example, the count of all page views by user agent name, log details, etc.). By default, all tables are sortable by any one column.

If you are using the [`FACET`](/docs/insights/nrql-new-relic-query-language/nrql-reference/nrql-syntax-components-functions#sel-facet) clause, the results will normally be returned as a table.

You can use a table as a shortcut to other dashboards. If a table is faceted by attribute, selecting an entry takes you to an existing dashboard [filtered by that attribute](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/filter-new-relic-one-dashboards-facets/).

You can also export a table chart to a CSV file.

* If a filter is applied to a dashboard, the download will only include the subset of data based on the filter.
* If a specific fixed time range is selected, the CSV includes the data for that time period.
* If you query with multiple attributes, the export includes columns for all `FACET`s in the query.
* For charts with a time range dependent on the present moment (for example, `since 30 minutes ago`), the data in the CSV is generated from the present moment, not from when the chart was initially generated.

  The table chart type, with its tabular format, works well for dashboards, as well as for sharing the data in reports.
