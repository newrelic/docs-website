<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

<DNT>**NRQL Predictions**</DNT> in New Relic uses your metric's historical data to predict future trends, providing insights into how metrics might behave in the future. This proactive approach helps you visualize trends and anticipate potential issues, enabling timely interventions to maintain optimal system performance. While <DNT>**NRQL Predictions**</DNT> itself does not identify potential issues, it equips you with the information needed to assess trends and plan for future challenges.

For automatic identification of potential issues, you can enroll for the <DNT>**[Predictive Alerts](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/use-charts/nrql-predictions)**</DNT> feature, currently available in public preview. <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> work alongside <DNT>**NRQL Predictions**</DNT> to automatically trigger alerts when projected trends indicate a potential issue, allowing for proactive management of your systems.

## Pricing [#pricing]

  Your use of <DNT>**NRQL Predictions**</DNT> is billable during preview in accordance with your Order as applicable to the pricing model associated with your Account. New Relic Query Language queries (NRQLS) related to use of this feature are billable as the Core Compute Product. If this feature becomes generally available, your use will be billable in accordance with your Order.

  For further details on pricing, please contact our sales team or refer to your Order.

## Enrollment [#enrollment]
To enroll for the <DNT>**NRQL Predictions**</DNT> feature, navigate to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Administration](https://one.newrelic.com//admin-portal) > Preview & Trials**</DNT>, and enable <DNT>**NRQL predictions**</DNT>.

## Add prediction on a line or area chart [#add-prediction]

You can add predictions to line and area charts in following two ways:
* Add a prediction to an existing chart.
* Use the `PREDICT` clause with an NRQL query.

### Add a prediction to an existing chart
To add a prediction to an existing chart, follow these steps:

<Steps>

  <Step>
    ### Access a line or area chart [#access-a-chart]

    1. Go to [one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities).
    2. To add prediction to a line or area chart, select it from <DNT>**Dashboards**</DNT>, or open it from <DNT>**Metrics and events**</DNT>.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add prediction [#add-prediction]

  To add prediction, from the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> menu, select <DNT>**Predict trend**</DNT>. In **Data Explorer**, the prediction trend appears on the chart, projecting future trends. The prediction range is automatically set to 20% of the query window, and highlighted in gray. The graph appears in dotted lines within the predicted range. 

  The `PREDICT` keyword is appended to the chart query. You can [refine the query](#customize-prediction-range) according to your requirements and run it to get the updated trend.

  <Callout variant="tip">
 When you add prediction to an area chart, the chart type changes to a line chart with prediction.
  </Callout>

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add to dashboard [#add-to-dashboard]

    1. To add the chart with prediction to a dashboard, click <DNT>**Add to dashboard**</DNT>.
    2. Enter a widget name.
    3. Select a dashboard in which you want to add the widget, or create a new dashboard for it.

    You can now view the chart with prediction on the selected dashboard.

  </Step>
  
</Steps>

### Use the `PREDICT` clause in an NRQL query
To add the `PREDICT` clause to an NRQL query, follow these steps:

<Steps>

  <Step>
    ### Create an NRQL query [#create-or-edit-query]

    1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) and select the account in which you want to create the query.
    2. To open <DNT>**Data Explorer**</DNT>, select <DNT>**Query Your Data**</DNT>.
    3. Compose a time series query using the NRQL syntax. Refer [NRQL syntax documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions) for more information.

  <Callout variant="important">
  Make sure the query does not include [metric timeslice data](/docs/data-analysis/metrics/analyze-your-metrics/data-collection-metric-timeslice-event-data#timeslice-data), the [`COMPARE WITH`](/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#sel-compare) clause, or [nested aggregations](/docs/nrql/using-nrql/nested-aggregation-make-ordered-computations-single-query) inside [subqueries](/docs/nrql/using-nrql/subqueries-in-nrql/), as predictions are not supported in these cases.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add prediction [#add-prediction]

  To add prediction to the chart, append the query with the `PREDICT` clause run it. The prediction range is automatically set to 20% of the query window, and highlighted in gray. The graph appears in dotted lines within the predicted range.

  You can further [refine the query](#customize-prediction-range) according to your requirements.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add to dashboard [#add-to-dashboard]

    1. To add the chart with prediction to a dashboard, click <DNT>**Add to dashboard**</DNT>.
    2. Enter a widget name.
    3. Select a dashboard in which you want to add the widget, or create a new dashboard for it.

    You can now view the chart with prediction on the selected dashboard.

  </Step>
  
</Steps>


## Supported Prediction Algorithms[#supported-algorithms]
Currently, <DNT>**NRQL predictions**</DNT> only supports the <DNT>**Holt-Winters**</DNT> algorithm for both seasonal and non-seasonal time series. This is a commonly used and standard algorithm for forecasting and prediction tasks. We support hourly, daily, and weekly seasonal lengths for the Holt-Winters model.

## Default behavior[#defaults]
The `PREDICT` clause in a query comes with the following default behaviors:
* **Seasonality**: Automatically detects and identifies if the data exhibits any seasonality.
* **Prediction window**: Projects 20% of the total time span specified in your query window.
* **Historical data for training**: Uses historical data from the current query window and the two preceding ones to generate predictions.
* **Time interval**: Aligns with the data point interval of the time series in the query window to ensure consistency in data projection.

Example NRQL and chart using `PREDICT`:

```sql
FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE error IS TRUE TIMESERIES PREDICT
```
The default prediction on the chart appears as follows:

## Customize the predictive model [#customize-prediction-range]
You can customize the predictions by manually setting the training model's hyperparameters and adding the `USING` and `BY` keywords. To get familiar with NRQL, refer to [NRQL documentation](/docs/nrql/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language).

    <CollapserGroup>
      <Collapser id="hyperparameters" title="Set model hyperparameters">
      Currently, <DNT>**Holt-Winters**</DNT> is the only prediction algorithm we support, and it comes with several hyperparameters to help you fine-tune your predictions. Refer to the following table to understand the behavior of each hyperparameter and choose the ones that suit your use case.
      
      To modify your query, append `holtwinters(<hyperparameters>: <value>)` after the `PREDICT` clause.

      <Collapser id="by" title={<>Add the <InlineCode>BY</InlineCode> keyword</>}>
      Use the `BY` keyword to set how far ahead in time you want the model to predict. For example, `PREDICT BY 3 hours` generates a prediction 3 hours into the future from the latest point in the time series. Make sure, the time span is an `integer unit` of time.
      </Collapser>

      <Collapser id="using" title={<>Add the <InlineCode>USING</InlineCode> keyword</>}>
      Use the `USING` keyword to specify the amount of historical data you want to use to train the model. For example, `PREDICT USING 1 day` uses the query window along with the data from the preceding day to train the model. Make sure the time span is an `integer unit` of time.
      amount of time.

    </CollapserGroup>

Example of using hyperparameters and the `BY` and `USING` keywords:

```sql
FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE error IS TRUE TIMESERIES PREDICT holtwinters(seasonality: AUTO, alpha: 0.2) BY 1 hour USING 2 hours
```

This query sets the seasonality to automatic detection and emphasizes historical data by adjusting the level smoothing factor. It predicts one hour into the future and trains the model using the query window length along with the previous two hours of historical data. The chart displays the customized prediction as follows:
