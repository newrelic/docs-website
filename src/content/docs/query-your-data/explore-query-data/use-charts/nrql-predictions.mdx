<Callout title="preview">
  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

## Overview [#purpose]

<DNT>**NRQL Predictions**</DNT> in New Relic uses your metric's historical data patterns to predict or forecast future trends, providing insights into how metrics might behave in the future. This proactive approach helps you visualize trends and anticipate potential issues, enabling timely interventions to maintain optimal system performance. This feature currently supports predictions for both seasonal (data that has a recurring, repeatable pattern on a set cadence) and non-seasonal time series. Metrics that exhibit a strong trend or defined seasonal pattern are best suited for predictions. These predictions are best utilized when added to existing dashboards to give a quick visual indicator as to where your metrics are headed.

</figcaption>

Examples of situations where you might want to add predictions to your chart or dashboard:
* Your application is producing more logs over the past few hours and the disk space is running out.
* Your application is steadily running out of memory, threatening to crash the entire container. 
* You need to project future revenue based upon observed seasonal and trend patterns.

While <DNT>**NRQL Predictions**</DNT> themselves do not identify potential issues, they equip you with the information you need to assess trends and plan for future challenges. To generate alerts when the predicted values indicate an impending problem, you can enroll for the <DNT>**[Predictive alerts](/docs/alerts/create-alert/set-thresholds/predictive-alerts)**</DNT> feature, currently available in public preview. <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> works alongside <DNT>**NRQL Predictions**</DNT> to generate predictions for your metrics and alert when those predicted values pass a static threshold.

## Pricing [#pricing]

Your use of <DNT>**NRQL Predictions**</DNT> is billable during preview in accordance with your Order as applicable to the pricing model associated with your Account. New Relic Query Language queries related to use of this feature are billable as the Core Compute Product. If this feature becomes generally available, your use will be billable in accordance with your Order.

## Usage [#usage]

<DNT>**NRQL Predictions**</DNT> can be generated in two ways: either directly on charts you have already created or by writing a NRQL query using the `PREDICT` clause. 

<CollapserGroup>

<Collapser id="predictions-on-existing-chart" title="Add predictions to an existing chart.">
 <DNT>**NRQL Predictions**</DNT> can only be added to charts that depict time series, such as a line or area chart. To add a pred<DNT>**NRQL Prediction**</DNT>iction to an existing chart, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    #### Access a line or area chart [#access-a-chart]

    1. Go to [one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities).
    2. To add predictions to a line or area chart, select it from <DNT>**Dashboards**</DNT>, or open it from <DNT>**Metrics and events**</DNT>.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Add predictions [#add-prediction]

    To add a prediction, from the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> menu, select <DNT>**Predict trend**</DNT>. In **Data Explorer**, the prediction appears on the chart. The prediction range is automatically set to 20% of the query window. To indicate where the prediction is on the chart, the area is highlighted in gray and the predicted values are connected by a dashed line.

    The `PREDICT` clause is appended to the query and generates predictions using the [<DNT>**NRQL Predictions**</DNT> default behavior](#defaults). You can [refine the query](#customize-prediction-range) by fine-tuning according to your requirements and re-run it to get the updated predictions.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      When you add predictions to an area chart, it changes to a line chart containing the predictions.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Add to dashboard [#add-to-dashboard]
    To add a chart containing predictions to a dashboard:

    1. Click <DNT>**Add to dashboard**</DNT>.
    2. Enter a widget name.
    3. Either select an existing dashboard or create a new one.

## Default behavior [#defaults]

<Callout variant="important">
  The default usage `PREDICT` will provide the best prediction results.
</Callout>

The `PREDICT` clause in a query comes with the following default behaviors which are dependent upon your query window duration (specified using the `SINCE` and `UNTIL` clauses):

<table id="default behavior">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th colSpan={2}>
        <DNT>
          **Default behavior**
        </DNT>
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ width: "300px" }}>
        Seasonality
      </td>
      <td>
        Automatically detects whether seasonality is present in the historic data. If seasonality is detected, the identified season length is used to generate a seasonal model, otherwise a non-seasonal model is used. We currently support seasonal lengths of hourly, daily, and weekly. Refer to the [algorithm section](#algorithm) below for more details on seasonality.

      <td>
        Hyperparameters are automatically optimized and selected based upon the historical data.

    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td style={{ width: "300px" }}>
        Amount of historical data for training
      </td>
      <td>
        Uses historical data from the last three query windows (the current one and the two preceding it). For example, if your query window is one hour in length, a total of three hours will be used for training. Additionally, if you want to only display a certain length of time in the query window but use more data for training, you can use the `USING` clause [documented below](#customize-model). If a seasonality other than the default is specified, the amount of training data used will be different. Refer to the section on [seasonality](#algorithm) below.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td style={{ width: "300px" }}>
        Prediction window
      </td>
      <td>
        Predicts a range equal to 20% of the total time span specified in your query window. For example, if your query window is 1 hour, the predictions will be for the next 12 minutes. You can override this default with the `BY` clause [documented below](#customize-model).

      </td>
    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>
</Collapser>


## Customizing the predictions with `BY` and `USING`[#customize-model]
You can customize the predictions by manually setting the model's seasonality and adding the `BY` and `USING` keywords.

    <CollapserGroup>
      <Collapser id="by" title={<>Add the <InlineCode>BY</InlineCode> keyword.</>}>
      Use the `BY` keyword to set how far ahead in time you want the model to predict. For example, `PREDICT BY 3 hours` generates predictions up to three hours into the future from the latest point in the time series. Make sure the time span is an `integer unit` of time. The maximum amount you can predict is 360 time windows (i.e., your time series window size times 360).

      Example query with `BY` keyword that will generate predictions for the next 30 minutes:
      ```sql
      FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE error IS TRUE TIMESERIES PREDICT BY 30 minutes
      ```
    </Collapser>

    <Collapser id="using" title={<>Add the <InlineCode>USING</InlineCode> keyword.</>}>
      Use the `USING` keyword to specify the amount of historical data you want to use to train the model. The total amount of data used is the sum of the query window duration (specified with the `SINCE` and `UNTIL` clauses) and value specified with the `USING` clause. For example, `PREDICT USING 1 day` uses the query window plus the data from the preceding day to train the model. Make sure the time span is an `integer unit` of time. 
      
      There is a limit to how much data can be used to train a model and if you specify an amount that exceeds the limit, you will receive an error message. This limit is 3,660 data points and you can figure out how much time that is by using the time series window. So for example, if you are querying a time series with a 1 minute time window, you will only be able to specify an amount of training data of up to 3,660 minutes, which is 61 hours or approximately 2.5 days.

      Example query with the `USING` keyword with `SINCE` specification that will use 3 days of historical data (2 days from the `USING` and 1 day from the `SINCE`):
      ```sql
      FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE error IS TRUE TIMESERIES SINCE 1 day ago PREDICT USING 2 days
      ```

      Example query with the `USING` keyword with both the `SINCE` and `UNTIL` specifications that will use 54 hours of historical data (2 days from the `USING` and 6 hours from the `SINCE` and `UNTIL`):
      ```sql
      FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE error IS TRUE TIMESERIES SINCE 1 day ago UNTIL 6 hours ago PREDICT USING 2 days
      ```

      Example query with the `USING` keyword with the default query window that will use 49 hours of historical data (2 days from the `USING` and 1 hour from the default query window):
      ```sql
      FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE error IS TRUE TIMESERIES PREDICT USING 2 days
      ```
    </Collapser>

## Algorithm [#algorithm]
Currently, <DNT>**NRQL predictions**</DNT> only supports the <DNT>**[Holt-Winters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing#Triple_exponential_smoothing_(Holt_Winters))**</DNT> algorithm, also known as exponential smoothing, for both seasonal and non-seasonal time series. This is a commonly used and standard algorithm for forecasting and time series predictions. For non-seasonal time series, only the level (average value) and trend (average increase or decrease) are modeled.

<figcaption>
  Predictions generated using <DNT>**NRQL Predictions**</DNT> for a non-seasonal time series.
</figcaption>

For sesaonal time series, the seasonality is included in addition to the level and the trend. Seasonality represents the repeatable pattern that occurs on some periodic basis. We support automatic season detection of hourly, daily, and weekly seasonal lengths by default for the Holt-Winters model. In order to detect each seasonal length, you must ensure that you are providing enough data through a combination of the query window duration (specified using the `SINCE` and `UNTIL` clauses) and the `USING` clause. The minimum amount of data required is for each seasonal length is specified below. By default, when no `USING` clause is used, <DNT>**NRQL predictions**</DNT> will use <DNT>**3 times the query window**</DNT> to generate predictions.

<table id="seasonality">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Hourly
      </td>
      <td>
        Each timestamp within the hour behaves the same as in the previous hours. For example, 3:20pm will behave just like 2:20pm, 1:20pm, etc..
      </td>
      <td>
        2 hours
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Daily
      </td>
      <td>
        Each hour behaves the same as the previous hours. For example, 3pm today will behave the same as 3pm yesterday.
      </td>
       <td>
        2 days
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Weekly
      </td>
      <td>
        Each day of the week will behave the same as it did in the previous weeks. For example, Monday this week will behave the same as Monday in previous weeks.
      </td>
       <td>
        2 weeks
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Custom seasonal lengths can be specified if desired, using the `seasonality` parameter.

<figcaption>

</figcaption>

<Collapser id="seasonality" title="Setting custom seasonality.">
    We currently support predictions using non-seasonal and seasonal versions of Holt-Winters. To set a custom seasonality, use the `holtwinters(seasonality: <value>)` parameter to the `PREDICT` clause.

    Options: `<season length>`, `AUTO`, `NONE`. 
      * `<season length>` must be an `integer unit` of time (i.e., `1 day` or `3 hours`)
      * `AUTO` uses the automatic season detection. This is the same as the default behavior of not using `holtwinters(...)` parameter as part of the `PREDICT` clause.
      * `NONE` will generate non-seasonal predictions

    <Callout variant="important">
      If a season length is specified and the `USING` clause is used, the amount of data used for training will be equal to the query window plus the `USING` amount. If no `USING` is specified, the maximum of the seasonal length and 3 times the query window will be used.
    </Callout>

    Example query with user specified seasonality:
    ```sql
    FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE error IS TRUE TIMESERIES PREDICT holtwinters(seasonality: 1 hour)
    ```

    Example query specifying a non-seasonal model:
    ```sql
    FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE error IS TRUE TIMESERIES PREDICT holtwinters(seasonality: NONE)
    ```

    Example query specifying an automatic season detection (this is the same behavior as the default of not using the `holtwinters(...)` parameter):
    ```sql
    FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE error IS TRUE TIMESERIES PREDICT holtwinters(seasonality: AUTO)

## Advanced usage [#advanced-usage]

  <Collapser id="hyperparameters" title="Set optional Holt-Winters model hyperparameters.">
  <Callout variant="important">
    Adjusting the model parameters is intended for advanced users who want fine-grain control over the model and for recreating predictions generated with [Predictive Alerts](/docs/alerts/create-alert/set-thresholds/predictive-alerts)
  </Callout>
  Currently, <DNT>**Holt-Winters**</DNT> is the only supported prediction algorithm and there are several hyperparameters that can be adjusted to fine-tune your predictions. The hyperparameters can be modified by adding `holtwinters(<hyperparameter>: <value>)` after the `PREDICT` clause in your query. Any combination of the following parameters can be added to modify how the model is fit to the historical data:

      </td>
      <td>
        The season smoothing factor where a larger value gives more weight to recent values. This parameter is not compatible with non-seasonal models and the query will return an error if you try to specify `holtwinters(seasonality: NONE, gamma: <value>)`.

  Example query with hyperparameter modifications:
  ```sql
  FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE error IS TRUE TIMESERIES PREDICT holtwinters(alpha: 0.2, beta: 0.5, gamma: 0.5, phi: 0.99)
  ```

  Example query with the `PREDICT` clause specifying the seasonality, custom hyperparameters, and adding the `BY` and `USING` keywords:

  ```sql
  FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE error IS TRUE TIMESERIES PREDICT holtwinters(seasonality: AUTO, alpha: 0.2) BY 1 hour USING 2 hours
  ```

  This query sets the seasonality to automatic detection and emphasizes historical data by adjusting the level smoothing factor. It predicts one hour into the future and trains the model using the query window length along with the previous two hours of historical data.
