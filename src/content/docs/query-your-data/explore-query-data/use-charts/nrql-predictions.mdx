  We're still working on this feature, but we'd love for you to try it out!

  This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy).
</Callout>

## Overview [#purpose]

<DNT>**NRQL Predictions**</DNT> in New Relic uses your metric's historical data patterns to predict future trends, providing insights into how metrics might behave in the future. This proactive approach helps you visualize trends and anticipate potential issues, enabling timely interventions to maintain optimal system performance. This feature currently supports predictions for both seasonal (data that has a recurring, repeatable pattern on a set cadence) and non-seasonal time series. Metrics that exhibit a strong trend or defined seasonal pattern are best suited for NRQL predictions. These predictions are best utilized when adding them to existing dashboards to give a quick visual indicator as to where your metrics are headed.

Examples of situations where you might want to add a prediction to your chart:
* Your application is producing more logs over the past few hours and the disk space is running out.
* Your application is steadily running out of memory, threatening to crash the entire container. 
* Projecting future revenue based upon observed seasonal and trend patterns.

 While <DNT>**NRQL Predictions**</DNT> themselves do not identify potential issues, they equip you with the information needed to assess trends and plan for future challenges. To generate alerts when the predictions indicate an impending problem, you can enroll for the <DNT>**[Predictive Alerts](/docs/alerts/create-alert/set-thresholds/predictive-alerts)**</DNT> feature, currently available in public preview. <DNT>**Predictive Alerts**</DNT> works alongside <DNT>**NRQL Predictions**</DNT> to generate predictions for your metrics and alert when those predictions pass a static threshold.

## Usage [#usage]

<DNT>**NRQL Predictions**</DNT> can be generated in two easy ways: either directly on charts you have already created or by writing a NRQL query using the `PREDICT` clause. 

<CollapserGroup>
<Collapser id="prediction-on-existing-chart" title="Add a prediction to an existing chart.">
 Predictions can only be added to charts that depict time series, such as a line or area chart. To add a prediction to an existing chart, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    #### Access a line or area chart [#access-a-chart]

    1. Go to [one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities).
    2. To add a prediction to a line or area chart, select it from <DNT>**Dashboards**</DNT>, or open it from <DNT>**Metrics and events**</DNT>.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    #### Add a prediction [#add-prediction]

  To add a prediction, from the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> menu, select <DNT>**Predict trend**</DNT>. In **Data Explorer**, the prediction appears on the chart. The prediction range is automatically set to 20% of the query window. To indicate where the prediction is on the chart, the area is highlighted in gray and the predicted values are connected by a dashed line.

  The `PREDICT` clause is appended to the query and generates a prediction using the [NRQL predictions default behavior](#defaults). You can [refine the query](#customize-prediction-range) by fine-tuning according to your requirements and re-run it to get the updated predictions.

  <Callout variant="tip">
 When you add a prediction to an area chart, the chart type changes to a line chart with a prediction.
  </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    #### Add to dashboard [#add-to-dashboard]

    1. To add the chart with prediction to a dashboard, click <DNT>**Add to dashboard**</DNT>.
    2. Enter a widget name.
    3. Select a dashboard in which you want to add the widget, or create a new dashboard for it.

    You can now view the chart with prediction on the selected dashboard.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Collapser id="use-predict-clause" title="Use the `PREDICT` clause in an NRQL query.">
In order to make use of NRQL predictions streamlined, the `PREDICT` clause was added to the NRQL syntax. For details of its usage and examples, please refer to [the NRQL syntax documentation](/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions). 

Example of using `PREDICT` in NRQL query:

```sql
FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE error IS TRUE TIMESERIES PREDICT
```
The default prediction on the chart appears as follows:

## Default behavior [#defaults]
Currently, <DNT>**NRQL predictions**</DNT> only supports the <DNT>**Holt-Winters**</DNT> algorithm for both seasonal and non-seasonal time series. This is a commonly used and standard algorithm for forecasting and prediction tasks. We support hourly, daily, and weekly seasonal lengths for the Holt-Winters model.

In general, the default behavior should be sufficient for the majority of NRQL prediction use cases.

The `PREDICT` clause in a query comes with the following default behaviors:
* **Seasonality**: Automatically detects whether seasonality is present in the historic data. If seasonality is detected, the identified season length is used in the Holt-Winters seasonal algorithm. If no seasonality is found, it constructs a non-seasonal model.
* **Hyperparameters**: Values for the Holt-Winters hyperparameters are determined based upon the seasonality and analysis of the historic data
* **Prediction window**: Predicts a range equal to 20% of the total time span specified in your query window.
* **Historical data for training**: Uses historical data from the current query window and the two preceding ones to generate predictions.
* **Time interval**: Aligns with the data point interval of the time series in the query window to ensure consistency in data projection.

## Customizing the predictive model [#customize-prediction-range]
You can customize the predictions by manually setting the training model's hyperparameters and adding the `USING` and `BY` keywords. To learn more about NRQL and its syntax, refer to [NRQL documentation](/docs/nrql/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language). Generally, the only hyperparameter most users will want to adjust will be the seasonality. The algorithm will perform best when a known seasonality (or known non-seasonality) is specified by the user. The other hyperparameters for the Holt-Winters algorithm are accessible and changeable, but default values are determined based on the historical data for your metric.

    <CollapserGroup>
      <Collapser id="hyperparameters" title="Set seasonality and Holt-Winters model hyperparameters.">
      Currently, <DNT>**Holt-Winters**</DNT> is the only prediction algorithm we support and there are several hyperparameters that can be adjusted to fine-tune your predictions. The hyperparameters can be modified by adding `holtwinters(<hyperparameter>: <value>)` after the `PREDICT` clause in your query. Any combination of the following parameters can added to modify the result of the predictions:

      * `seasonality` Specifies what whether you want to use a known season length, automatic seasonality detection, or no seasonality (`<season length>`, `AUTO`, `NONE`). 
        * `<season length>` must be an `integer unit` of time (i.e. `1 day` or `3 hours`)
      * `alpha` Level smoothing factor (`[0, 1.0]`) where a larger value gives more weight to recent values 
      * `beta` Trend smoothing factor (`[0, 1.0]`) where a larger value gives more weight to recent values 
      * `gamma` Season smoothing factor (`[0, 1.0]`) where a larger value gives more weight to recent values 
        * Not compatible with the `seasonality: NONE` option because a non-seasonal model does not use the `gamma` hyperparameter. The query will error if you try to specify `holtwinters(seasonality: NONE, gamma: <value>)`
      * `phi` Trend damping parameter (`[0.98, 1.0]`) where a smaller values indicates more damping of the trend and a prediction that will flatten out

      Example query with hyperparameter modifications:
      ```sql
      FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE error IS TRUE TIMESERIES PREDICT holtwinters(seasonality: 1 hour, alpha: 0.2, beta: 0.5, gamma: 1.5, phi: 0.99)
      ```
      </Collapser>

      <Collapser id="by" title={<>Add the <InlineCode>BY</InlineCode> keyword.</>}>
      Use the `BY` keyword to set how far ahead in time you want the model to predict. For example, `PREDICT BY 3 hours` generates a prediction of three hours into the future from the latest point in the time series. Make sure the time span is an `integer unit` of time.

      Example query with `BY` keyword that will generate predictions for the next 30 minutes:
      ```sql
      FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE error IS TRUE TIMESERIES PREDICT BY 30 minutes
      ```
      </Collapser>

      <Collapser id="using" title={<>Add the <InlineCode>USING</InlineCode> keyword.</>}>
      Use the `USING` keyword to specify the amount of historical data you want to use to train the model. For example, `PREDICT USING 1 day` uses the query window along with the data from the preceding day to train the model. Make sure the time span is an `integer unit` of time.

      Example query with the `USING` keyword that will use 2 days of historical data:
      ```sql
      FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE error IS TRUE TIMESERIES PREDICT USING 2 days
      ```
      </Collapser>
    </CollapserGroup>

Example of using the `PREDICT` clause with hyperparameter modification, and the `BY` and `USING` keywords:

```sql
FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE error IS TRUE TIMESERIES PREDICT holtwinters(seasonality: AUTO, alpha: 0.2) BY 1 hour USING 2 hours
```

This query sets the seasonality to automatic detection and emphasizes historical data by adjusting the level smoothing factor. It predicts one hour into the future and trains the model using the query window length along with the previous two hours of historical data. The chart displays the customized prediction as follows:
