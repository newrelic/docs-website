<Collapser id="prediction-on-existing-chart" title="Add a prediction to an existing chart.">
 To add a prediction to an existing chart, follow these steps:

<Steps>

  <Step>
    ### Access a line or area chart [#access-a-chart]

    1. Go to [one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities).
    2. To add prediction to a line or area chart, select it from <DNT>**Dashboards**</DNT>, or open it from <DNT>**Metrics and events**</DNT>.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add prediction [#add-prediction]

  To add prediction, from the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> menu, select <DNT>**Predict trend**</DNT>. In **Data Explorer**, the prediction trend appears on the chart, projecting future trends. The prediction range is automatically set to 20% of the query window, and highlighted in gray. The graph appears in dotted lines within the predicted range. 

  The `PREDICT` keyword is appended to the chart query. You can [refine the query](#customize-prediction-range) according to your requirements and run it to get the updated trend.

  <Callout variant="tip">
 When you add prediction to an area chart, the chart type changes to a line chart with prediction.

<Collapser id="use-predict-clause" title="Use the `PREDICT` clause in an NRQL query.">
 To add the `PREDICT` clause to an NRQL query, follow these steps:

<Steps>

  <Step>
    ### Create an NRQL query [#create-query]

    1. Go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) and select the account in which you want to create the query.
    2. To open <DNT>**Data Explorer**</DNT>, select <DNT>**Query Your Data**</DNT>.
    3. Compose a time series query using the NRQL syntax. Refer [NRQL syntax documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions) for more information.

  <Callout variant="important">
  Make sure the query does not include [metric timeslice data](/docs/data-analysis/metrics/analyze-your-metrics/data-collection-metric-timeslice-event-data#timeslice-data), the [`COMPARE WITH`](/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#sel-compare) clause, or [nested aggregations](/docs/nrql/using-nrql/nested-aggregation-make-ordered-computations-single-query) inside [subqueries](/docs/nrql/using-nrql/subqueries-in-nrql/), as predictions are not supported in these cases.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add prediction [#add-prediction-to-query]

  To add prediction to the chart, append the `PREDICT` clause to the query and  run it. The prediction range is automatically set to 20% of the query window, and highlighted in gray. The graph appears in dotted lines within the predicted range.

  You can further [refine the query](#customize-prediction-range) according to your requirements.

## Supported prediction algorithm [#supported-algorithm]
Currently, <DNT>**NRQL predictions**</DNT> only supports the <DNT>**Holt-Winters**</DNT> algorithm for both seasonal and non-seasonal time series. This is a commonly used and standard algorithm for forecasting and prediction tasks. We support hourly, daily, and weekly seasonal lengths for the Holt-Winters model.

## Default behavior [#defaults]
The `PREDICT` clause in a query comes with the following default behaviors:
* **Seasonality**: Automatically detects seasonality in the data and uses the same season length to construct the predictive model. If no seasonality is found, it constructs a non-seasonal model.
* **Prediction window**: Projects 20% of the total time span specified in your query window.
* **Historical data for training**: Uses historical data from the current query window and the two preceding ones to generate predictions.
* **Time interval**: Aligns with the data point interval of the time series in the query window to ensure consistency in data projection.

Example of using `PREDICT` in NRQL query:

```sql
FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE error IS TRUE TIMESERIES PREDICT
```
The default prediction on the chart appears as follows:

## Customize the predictive model [#customize-prediction-range]
You can customize the predictions by manually setting the training model's hyperparameters and adding the `USING` and `BY` keywords. To get familiar with NRQL, refer to [NRQL documentation](/docs/nrql/get-started/introduction-nrql-new-relics-query-language).

    <CollapserGroup>
      <Collapser id="hyperparameters" title="Set model hyperparameters.">
      Currently, <DNT>**Holt-Winters**</DNT> is the only prediction algorithm we support, and it comes with several hyperparameters to help you fine-tune your predictions. Refer to the following table to understand the behavior of each hyperparameter and choose the ones that suit your use case.
      
      To modify your query, append `holtwinters(<hyperparameters>: <value>)` after the `PREDICT` clause.
  
       <table id="hyperparameters">

      <Collapser id="by" title={<>Add the <InlineCode>BY</InlineCode> keyword.</>}>
      Use the `BY` keyword to set how far ahead in time you want the model to predict. For example, `PREDICT BY 3 hours` generates a prediction of three hours into the future from the latest point in the time series. Make sure the time span is an `integer unit` of time.
      </Collapser>

      <Collapser id="using" title={<>Add the <InlineCode>USING</InlineCode> keyword.</>}>
      Use the `USING` keyword to specify the amount of historical data you want to use to train the model. For example, `PREDICT USING 1 day` uses the query window along with the data from the preceding day to train the model. Make sure the time span is an `integer unit` of time.
      </Collapser>
    </CollapserGroup>

Example of using `PREDICT` with hyperparameters, `BY`, and `USING` keywords:

```sql
FROM Transaction SELECT count(*) WHERE error IS TRUE TIMESERIES PREDICT holtwinters(seasonality: AUTO, alpha: 0.2) BY 1 hour USING 2 hours
```

This query sets the seasonality to automatic detection and emphasizes historical data by adjusting the level smoothing factor. It predicts one hour into the future and trains the model using the query window length along with the previous two hours of historical data. The chart displays the customized prediction as follows:
