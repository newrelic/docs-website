Once created, you can customize the appearance of your chart to best present the data. You can share a chart in different formats and add a chart to a new or existing dashboard.

## Change the appearance of your chart [#change-appearance]

When you run your query in **advanced (NRQL) mode** or view your chart while using **basic mode** to specify data, the query builder analyzes your data and applies a [chart type](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/insights-chart-types) that fits your data.

You can select another chart type that you prefer — your chart should tell the story that you want to communicate. Some chart types may not be available due to the nature of the data you specified.

To change the appearance of your chart, use the **Chart type** menu to the right of the current chart. Each type in the list has a tooltip with information about using that type.

## Customize your charts [#customize-charts]

While we try our best to optimize how we display your data, sometimes you may have other needs. To this end, you can customize charts to display information at your convenience.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Customizations are available depending on the chart type.
</Callout>

### Format date and time [#custom-date-time]

<Callout variant="tip">
  For table and billboard charts.
</Callout>

Customize the date and time format for tables and billboards: for each type of data, you can select if you want to leave it as it is, or modify the format as **Numeric** or **Date**.

If data is a timestamp, you can choose how to represent the date and time:

![customchart02_dateformat.png](./images/customchart02_dateformat.png "customchart02_dateformat.png")

For numbers, select if you want us to auto-format them, or chose the number of decimals you want to see.

### Customize the Y axis [#custom-y-axis]

<Callout variant="tip">
  For line and area charts.
</Callout>

On line charts and area charts you can adjust the Y axis to display the data within certain values by setting a minimum and maximum value for the axis.

If no customization option is selected, [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) automatically displays the full Y axis from 0 to the top value plus a margin.

### Enable or disable the legend [#custom-legend]

<Callout variant="tip">
  For line and area charts, and histograms.
</Callout>

For line charts, area charts, and histograms, you can disable or enable the legend.

### Remove the Other groups facet [#custom-others]

<Callout variant="tip">
  For bar and pie charts, and tables.
</Callout>

When [faceting](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/filter-new-relic-one-dashboards-facets) on bar charts, pie charts, or tables, and if the number of faceting on queries is larger than 2,000, the **Other groups** facet aggregates the rest of facets. With this customization you can select whether to see **Other groups**, or remove it.

## Chart share and view options [#share-charts]

Most charts have various options, including a chart-embed option, getting a chart as an image, and adding a chart to a dashboard. To read about general chart options, see [Basic UI features](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/new-relic-one-core-ui-components).
