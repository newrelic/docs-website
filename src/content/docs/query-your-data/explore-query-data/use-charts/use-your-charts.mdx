Once created, you can customize the appearance of your chart to best present the data. You can share a chart in different formats and add a chart to a new or existing dashboard.

## Change the appearance of your chart [#change-appearance]

When you run your query in **advanced (NRQL) mode** or view your chart while using **basic mode** to specify data, the query builder analyzes your data and applies a [chart type](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/insights-chart-types) that fits your data.

You can select another chart type that you prefer — your chart should tell the story that you want to communicate. Some chart types may not be available due to the nature of the data you specified.

To change the appearance of your chart, use the **Chart type** menu to the right of the current chart. Each type in the list has a tooltip with information about using that type.

## Chart share and view options [#share-charts]

Most charts have various options, including a chart-embed option, getting a chart as an image, and adding a chart to a dashboard. To read about general chart options, see [Basic UI features](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/new-relic-one-core-ui-components).
