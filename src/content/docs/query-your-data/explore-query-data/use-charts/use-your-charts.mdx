Once you've created a chart, you can customize the appearance of it to best present the data. You can share a chart in different formats and add a chart to a new or existing dashboard.

## Use open-source charting library [#victory-charts]

You can use [Nerdpacks](https://developer.newrelic.com/explore-docs/custom-viz/) to create your own custom visualizations. We have also teamed up with Formidable so you can use an open-source charting library, and quickly add unique "victory charts" to your New Relic One dashboards. To learn about these [custom visualization Nerdpacks](https://developer.newrelic.com/build-apps/customize-nerdpack/), watch this short video (approx. 4 minutes).

## Change the appearance of your chart [#change-appearance]

When you run your query in **advanced (NRQL) mode** or view your chart while using the **data explorer** to specify data, the query builder analyzes your data and applies a [chart type](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/insights-chart-types) that fits your data.

For some queries, you'll have several options of chart types to choose from. To change chart type, use the **Chart type** menu to the right of the current chart. Each type in the list has a tooltip with information about using that type.

## Customize your charts [#customize-charts]

While we try our best to optimize how we display your data, sometimes you may have other needs. Depending on the chart type, additional customization options are available.

### Format date and time [#custom-date-time]

**Tables and billboards.**

Customize the date and time format for tables and billboards: for each type of data, you can select if you want to leave it as it is, or modify the format as **Numeric** or **Date**.

If data is a timestamp, you can choose how to represent the date and time:

![customchart02_dateformat.png](./images/customchart02_dateformat.png "customchart02_dateformat.png")

For numbers, select if you want us to auto-format them, or chose the number of decimals you want to see.

### Customize the Y axis [#custom-y-axis]

**Line charts and area charts.**

On line charts and area charts you can adjust the Y axis to display the data within certain values by setting a minimum and maximum value for the axis.

If no customization option is selected, [dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards) automatically displays the full Y axis from 0 to the top value plus a margin.

### Enable or disable the legend [#custom-legend]

**Line charts, area charts, and histograms.**

For line charts, area charts, and histograms, you can disable or enable the legend.

### Remove the other groups facet [#custom-others]

**Bar charts, pie charts, and tables.**

When [faceting](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/filter-new-relic-one-dashboards-facets) on bar charts, pie charts, or tables, and if the number of faceting on queries is larger than 2,000, the **Other groups** facet aggregates the rest of facets. With this customization you can select whether to see **Other groups**, or remove it.

## More chart-specific features [#more-types]

For more chart type-specific features, see [Chart types](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/chart-types/). 

## Chart share and view options [#share-charts]

Most charts have various options, including a chart-embed option, getting a chart as an image, and adding a chart to a dashboard. To read about general chart options, see [Basic UI features](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/new-relic-one-core-ui-components).
