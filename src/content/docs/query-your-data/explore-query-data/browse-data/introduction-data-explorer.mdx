With the data explorer you can navigate all your data visually, without any [NRQL](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language) knowledge. Use the data explorer to access, query and customize your data, create visualizations, and make connections between your services in a consistent and curated experience.

## Why it matters [#why-matters]

Do you research the state of your systems? Do you need to plan resources, identify and respond to incidents, or troubleshoot faulty behaviors? The data explorer makes it easy to identify, fetch and visualize the data you are looking for through visual menus, without ever using NRQL or building queries.

With the data explorer you can:

* Access [events](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#event-data) and [metrics](/docs/using-new-relic/data/understand-data/new-relic-data-types#metrics) data in a quick, intuitive way.
* Exploit the dimensionality of data by making it visible and easily actionable upon.
* See data from different points of view: from raw data to different visualizations that provide insights on evolution, distribution, etc.
* Drill down into data with filters.
* Add your searches to a [dashboard](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) in a click.
* Understand how [NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql) works: data explorer shows how queries are built while navigating the available data.

## Query your data [#explore-data]

To access the data explorer, go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) and

* At the top of the page, click the **Query your data** icon.

  ![NR One transition: explore data](./images/explore-data-icon.png "NR One transition: explore data")
* At the **Browse data** dropdown, select **Events** or **Metrics**.

  ![browse_data_explorer.png](./images/browse_data_explorer.png "browse_data_explorer.png")

The data explorer is the portal to explore all the data you have in New Relic. You can explore events and metrics on the data explorer UI, or select the [Logs](/docs/logs/log-management/ui-data/query-syntax-logs/) and [Traces](/docs/distributed-tracing/ui-data/understand-use-distributed-tracing-ui/) query interfaces to explore those. You can also access the [query builder](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder) any time by clicking on the tab.

### Use the data explorer [#use-explorer]

The data explorer consists of a scoping section on the top (a), a data browsing area on the left (b), and a workspace (c).

![Data explorer view](./images/data_explorer_updated.png "data_explorer_updated.png")

To use the data explorer:

1. Define the scope of the exploration: select the **account** and **data type** (metric or event) you want to browse.
2. Select the time range using the [time picker](/docs/using-new-relic/user-interface-functions/view-your-data/time-picker-set-time-periods-view-data).
3. Use the blocks on the left to browse the available data for either events or metrics, and build your search. You can only select one element per block. Blocks are searchable.

               Lists all the numeric attributes of the event previously selected.

               * The first item on the list is **count(\*)**, which is not an attribute. It calculates the [count](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions#func-count) of the selected event.
               * By default attributes are sorted by **Name**.
               * Select the [function](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions#functions) that you want to plot. By default each attribute is set to the function [**Average**](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions#func-average).

             <td>
               Lists all the dimensions of the event and plot previously selected.

               * Dimensions are string values that provide information on the event.
               * They represent the cardinality, that is, the [uniqueCount](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions#func-uniqueCount) of the different values of that attribute in the selected time range. If there is only one element it shows the value of the attribute.

## Visualize and refine your exploration [#workspace]

The result of your exploration is displayed in the working space on the right.

![dataexplorer02.png](./images/dataexplorer02.png "dataexplorer02.png")

<figcaption>
  Refine your exploration, or share your chart
</figcaption>

At the working space you can see:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="workspace-query-area"
    title="Querying area"
  >
    The querying area breaks down the query into its different constituents. Here you can easily read the result of your exploration as a NRQL query, and check the exact data being plotted.

    If you are not familiar with NRQL, check this area to learn how queries are built.

    The different parts of the query are:

    * \[EVENTS ONLY]`FROM`: the event selected on the first block.
    * [`SELECT`](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions#state-select): the plot or metric selected. This input plots only one value and one function.
    * [`GROUP BY`](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions#sel-facet): represents the `FACET` clause, and groups the data by the selected dimension.
    * [`LIMIT`](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions#sel-limit): type in the amount of values you want to see.
    * [`WHERE`](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions#sel-where): use this field to further filter results. This input plots `n` values.

    Each item can be deleted from the query by clicking on the **x**.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="workspace-query-display"
    title="NRQL query display"
  >
    You can see the full query, which is composed by the fields above and the [time range selected](#explore-data) with the time picker.

    <Callout variant="tip">
      Need to do more advanced searches or customize your charts? From the data explorer you can access the [query builder](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/choose-data/use-advanced-nrql-mode-specify-data) to edit the query.
    </Callout>
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="workspace-chart"
    title="Chart area"
  >
    By default data is displayed on a **line chart**. You can easily change to **Area chart**, **Pie chart**, and **Bar chart** using the chart picker. You can also choose to see your results' **raw data** as a table, or as in **JSON format**.

    If you have selected a dimension, the chart is updated with the different facets. Below the chart you can see the facets' table with the list of facets and the value for each one.

    Use the facet table to drill down data. By clicking on a facet, it is applied as a filter. The table stays visible so you can easily select another facet to continue your exploration.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="share-export"
    title="Share and export"
  >
    You can get the chart as an image, share it as a link, or add it to a dashboard using the **Options** menu on the top right corner.

    You can also copy the URL and share your whole exploration with other New Relic users.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

## Use cases

See the following examples to learn how and when to use the data explorer.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="use-case-validate-data"
    title="Discover your new data"
  >
    **I’ve just connected new instrumentation and want to see if new data is available.**

    1. Select the account and event or metric that's generating the new data.
    2. Use the different tools in the data explorer to toy around the new data that has become available: have a look at the raw data of that event or metric as a table, shape it as a list, or click to see it plotted as a chart.
    3. After selecting an event or metric, discover the shape of the data in its dimensions. Guided by cardinality, you can see the different points of view of any data.
    4. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="use-case-new-data"
    title="Validate your data"
  >
    **I changed a custom event/metric and need to check if this change has been successful.**

    1. In the data explorer tab, select the account, data type and event/metric you made changes to.
    2. Verify the entity is reporting data, and that all the attributes are being plotted.
    3. Find the attribute you made changes to and check the update was successful.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="use-case-troubleshooting"
    title="Troubleshooting data issues"
  >
    **I know there’s something off with an event/metric from an alert or dashboard. I need to know the root cause about the event/metric/attribute behavior.**

    1. In the data explorer, use the menus to select the event or metric that's not behaving as expected and let the data explorer plot that chart.
    2. From there, you can drill down in the dimensions of that data and filter by those attributes that are relevant.
    3. You can also see that data from different perspectives: its distribution, ranking of values, or evolution over time.
    4. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague.
