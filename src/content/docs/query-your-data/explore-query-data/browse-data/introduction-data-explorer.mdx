## Why it matters [#why-matters]

Do you research the state of your systems? Do you need to plan resources, identify and respond to incidents, or troubleshoot faulty behaviors? Metrics and events makes it easy to identify, fetch and visualize the data you are looking for through visual menus, without ever using NRQL or building queries.

With **Metrics and events** you can access all data stored in the New Relic database (NRDB) in a quick, intuitive way. You can then select **Dimensions** to facet by specific dimensions of that data. 

Other things metrics and events helps you do:

* See data from different points of view: from raw data to different visualizations that provide insights on evolution, distribution, and more. 
* Drill down into data using filters.
* Add your searches to a [dashboard](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards). 
* Understand how [NRQL](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/introduction-nrql) works: metrics and events shows how queries are built.

## Types of data you can explore [#data-types]

In the context of **Metrics and events**, `event` refers to all objects stored in the New Relic database (NRDB). Metrics and events let you explore: 

* Metrics: 
  * [Dimensional metrics](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#dimensional-metrics) (the `Metric` data type).
  * [Metric timeslice data](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#timeslice-data): this data type is reported by APM agents, mobile agents, and the browser agent. To explore this type of data, you must choose an entity monitored by one of those agents, and then you'll see those options. 
* Events: the [event data type](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/new-relic-data-types/#events-new-relic).
* Logs: the `Log` data type (which you can also explore via our [logs UI](/docs/logs/ui-data/use-logs-ui)).
* Traces: the `Span` data type (which you can also explore via our [trace UI](/docs/distributed-tracing/ui-data/query-distributed-trace-data)).

## Explore your data [#explore-data]

To access the data explorer, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > Metrics and events**. 

Metrics and events consist of these:

* Scoping section on the top. You can select between `metrics` or `events` and  `account`. If you select metrics, you can filter by entity.
* Data browsing area on the left. If you choose `metrics`, the options are `metric` and `dimensions`. If you choose `events`, the options are `event type`, `plot`, and `dimensions`.
* Workspace. This area shows you the result of your choices.

## Visualize and refine your exploration [#workspace]

The working space on the right displays the result of your exploration.

At the working space you can see:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="workspace-query-area"
    title="Querying area"
  >
    The querying area breaks down the query into its different constituents. Here, you can easily read the result of your exploration as an NRQL query, and check the exact data being plotted.

    If you are not familiar with NRQL, check this area to learn about the build of the queries.

    The different parts of the query are these:

    * [`SELECT`](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions#state-select): the plot or metric selected. This input plots only one value and one function.
    * [`GROUP BY`](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions#sel-facet): represents the `FACET` clause, and groups the data by the selected dimension.
    * [`LIMIT`](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions#sel-limit): type in the amount of values you want to see.
    * [`WHERE`](/docs/query-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/getting-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions#sel-where): use this field to further filter results. This input plots `n` values.

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="workspace-query-display"
    title="NRQL query display"
  >
    You can see the full query, which is composed of the fields above and the [time range selected](#explore-data) with the time picker. If you move the mouse pointer over the query and click it, you'll edit the NRQL query in the query builder.

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="workspace-chart"
    title="Chart area"
  >
    By default, you see the data on a **line chart**. Change the view easily to **Area chart**, **Pie chart**, and **Bar chart** using the chart picker. You can also choose to see your results' **raw data** as a table, or as in **JSON format**.

    If you have selected a dimension, the chart is updated with the different facets. Below the chart you can see the facets' table with the list of facets and the value for each one.

    Use the facet table to drill down data. By clicking on a facet, it is applied as a filter. The table stays visible so you can easily select another facet to continue your exploration.

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="share-export"
    title="Share and export"
  >
    You can get the chart as an image, share it as a link, or add it to a dashboard using the **Options** menu on the top right corner.

    You can also copy the URL and share your whole exploration with other New Relic users.

## Visualize your custom metric after creating it [#visualize-metric]

  Follow these steps to visualize your custom metric through the metrics explorer:

    1. Access the data explorer, go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > All capabilities > Metrics and events**.

    2. Choose your entity.

    3. Click **See timeslice metrics for `your entity`** link.

      <img
      style={{ width: "50%" }}
      title="See timeslice metrics for `your entity`"
      alt="See timeslice metrics for `your entity`"
      src={queriesnrqlTimesliceMetricsLink}
      />

## Use cases [#uses-cases]

See the following examples to learn how and when to use metrics and events.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="use-case-validate-data"
    title="Discover your new data"
  >
    **I've just connected new instrumentation and want to see if new data is available.**

    1. Select the account and event or metric that's generating the new data.
    2. Use the different tools in metrics and events to toy around the new data that has become available: have a look at the raw data of that event or metric as a table, shape it as a list, or click to see it plotted as a chart.
    3. After selecting an event or metric, discover the shape of the data in its dimensions. Guided by cardinality, you can see the different points of view of any data.
    4. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="use-case-new-data"
    title="Validate your data"
  >
    **I changed a custom event/metric and need to check if this change has been successful.**

    1. In metrics and events, select the account, data type and event/metric you made changes to.
    2. Verify the entity is reporting data, and that all the attributes are being plotted.
    3. Find the attribute you made changes to and check the update was successful.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="use-case-troubleshooting"
    title="Troubleshooting data issues"
  >
    **I know there's something off with an event/metric from an alert or dashboard. I need to know the root cause about the event/metric/attribute behavior.**

    1. In metrics and events, use the menus to select the event or metric that's not behaving as expected and let metrics and events plot that chart.
    2. From there, you can drill down in the dimensions of that data and filter by those attributes that are relevant.
    3. You can also see that data from different perspectives: its distribution, ranking of values, or evolution over time.
    4. Found anything relevant? Save it to a dashboard or share it with a colleague.
