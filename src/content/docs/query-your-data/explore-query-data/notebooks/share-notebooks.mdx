Notebooks are designed for collaboration. You can easily share your data-driven documents with team members to distribute insights, collaborate on investigations, or create reusable analysis templates.

## Notebook sharing overview

All notebooks created within your New Relic organization are automatically available to other organization members who have access to the notebooks feature. This enables seamless collaboration across your team.

<Callout variant="important">
  Currently, notebooks do not have granular permission settings. Anyone in your organization with access to the notebooks feature can view, edit, and delete any notebook. We are working on introducing more detailed permissions in a future release.
</Callout>

## Share a notebook URL

The simplest way to share a specific notebook is by sharing its URL:

1. Open the notebook you want to share.
2. Copy the URL from your browser's address bar.
3. Share the URL with your team members via email, chat, or your preferred communication tool.

Team members who click the URL will be taken directly to the notebook (assuming they have access to your New Relic organization).

## Find shared notebooks

To discover notebooks created by your team members:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**.
2. Open the **Query your data** console.
3. Click on **Notebooks** to view the notebooks index.
4. Browse all notebooks in your organization or use the search functionality to find specific notebooks.

### Search for notebooks

Use the search bar in the notebooks index to find specific notebooks by:

* Notebook name
* Keywords in the notebook title
* Content within the notebook (if searchable)

### Sort notebooks

Sort the notebooks list by:

* **Name**: Alphabetical order
* **Last modified**: Most recently updated first
* **Created date**: Newest or oldest first
* **Favorites**: Your starred notebooks appear at the top

## Collaboration best practices

### Naming conventions

Use clear, descriptive names for your notebooks to help team members understand their purpose:

* **Good**: "API Performance Investigation - Oct 2024"
* **Good**: "Weekly Error Rate Analysis Template"
* **Good**: "Customer Churn Analysis - Q3 Results"
* **Avoid**: "My Notebook" or "Test"

### Organization strategies

#### Create templates

Build reusable notebook templates for common analysis tasks:

1. Create a notebook with standard queries and structure
2. Use variables for customizable elements
3. Add Markdown instructions for team members
4. Name it clearly as a template (e.g., "Template: alert event Investigation")

#### Document your analysis

Use Markdown blocks to provide context:

* Explain the purpose of each query
* Document your analysis methodology
* Include links to related resources
* Add conclusions and next steps

#### Use descriptive visualizations

* Add clear titles to your charts
* Use consistent color schemes
* Include axis labels and units
* Add thresholds or baseline indicators where relevant

## Collaborative workflows

### Alert event response

Create collaborative alert event investigation notebooks:

1. Start with a standard alert event template
2. Add team members as the investigation progresses
3. Document findings in real-time using Markdown blocks
4. Include relevant queries and visualizations
5. Summarize root cause and remediation steps

### Weekly/monthly reporting

Build recurring analysis notebooks:

1. Create a notebook template with standard metrics
2. Use variables for time ranges and filters
3. Schedule regular reviews with your team
4. Archive completed reports with date-specific names

### Knowledge sharing

Transform one-time investigations into reusable knowledge:

1. Create detailed analysis notebooks
2. Include methodology and reasoning in Markdown
3. Add comments explaining unusual findings
4. Share with broader team for future reference

## Version control and history

<Callout variant="tip">
  Currently, notebooks do not have built-in version history. Consider duplicating important notebooks before making significant changes to preserve previous versions.
</Callout>

To maintain version control:

1. **Duplicate before major changes**: Create a copy of your notebook before making significant modifications
2. **Use descriptive names**: Include version numbers or dates in notebook names
3. **Document changes**: Use Markdown blocks to note what was changed and when
4. **Archive old versions**: Move outdated versions to a separate folder or naming convention

## Troubleshooting sharing issues

### Notebook not visible to team members

If team members can't see your notebook:

1. **Check organization access**: Ensure they belong to the same New Relic organization
2. **Verify feature access**: Confirm they have access to the notebooks preview feature
3. **Try direct URL**: Share the specific notebook URL rather than expecting them to find it in the index

### Performance with shared notebooks

Large or complex notebooks may load slowly for all users:

1. **Optimize queries**: Use appropriate time ranges and filters
2. **Limit result sets**: Use `LIMIT` clauses in NRQL queries
3. **Consider splitting**: Break very large notebooks into smaller, focused documents
