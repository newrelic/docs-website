<Callout variant="preview">
  We're still actively developing notebooks, but we're excited for you to try this powerful new feature! This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our pre-release policies.
</Callout>

Notebooks provide a dynamic and organized way to tell a complete story with your data. They are structured, data-driven documents that let you combine queries, visualizations, and descriptive text into a single, shareable asset.

Whether you're conducting a deep-dive investigation, documenting a critical incident, or sharing analytical insights with your team, notebooks allow you to build a clear narrative around your data.

## Why use notebooks?

Notebooks streamline your workflow and turn raw data into actionable stories:

* **Query, analyze, and visualize data**: Seamlessly query all your observability data (logs, metrics, events) and create visualizations to gain a better understanding of your system's performance.
* **Create post-mortems and incident documents**: Collaborate with your team to document investigations and create a clear, reusable record for incident post-mortems and root cause analysis.
* **Build reusable workflows and runbooks**: Create and share step-by-step guides for complex analysis, using variables to ensure consistent and repeatable processes.
* **Add context and narrative**: Use Markdown to easily add detailed titles, notes, and explanations to your queries and charts, transforming disconnected data points into a cohesive story.
* **Stay in one place, unifying your data**: Seamlessly query your observability, security and business data without switching between different tools or tabs with the power of New Relic Lens.

## Get started with notebooks

To start using notebooks:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**.
2. Open the **Query your data** console from the drawer at the bottom of the page.
3. Click on **Notebooks** in the query builder header to see a list of all notebooks created by your organization.

## Create a new notebook

You have two simple ways to start a new notebook:

### Start from the notebooks index

1. Select the **+ Create a notebook** button at the top-right corner of the index.
2. Give your notebook a meaningful name (names are searchable, so use relevant keywords like your service or application name).
3. Press **Create**.
4. The query console drawer opens. Type your first query!

### Start from the query console

1. Open the query console (the drawer at the bottom of the platform).
2. Create your desired queries and Markdown blocks.
3. Press the **Save** button.
4. Name your notebook, and press **Save**.

## Notebook blocks

Blocks are the fundamental building units of a notebook. They are individual sections you add to structure your analysis and narrative.

### Query blocks

Use query blocks to write NRQL queries and visualize the results. All single query chart types and customizations available in the standard query builder are supported in notebooks.

### Text blocks

Use Markdown to add rich text, titles, context, explanations, and descriptive text to tell the story of your investigation.

### Block actions

Every block can be manipulated to organize your document:

* **Duplicate**: Create a copy of the block
* **Delete**: Remove the block from your notebook
* **Move Up/Down**: Reorder blocks within your notebook
* **Move to Top/Bottom**: Quickly move blocks to the beginning or end

## Manage your notebooks

### Duplicate a notebook

1. Open the notebook you want to duplicate.
2. Click the arrow next to the tab name in the console drawer and click on **duplicate**.
3. Click **Duplicate** from the context menu.
4. A copy of the notebook will open in a new tab, ready for editing.

### Mark a notebook as favorite

To quickly find your most important notebooks, you can mark them as a favorite:

1. Click the star icon next to a notebook's name in the index page.
2. The icon will turn yellow, and the notebook will be grouped at the top of the index list.
3. Click the star icon again to remove it from your favorites.

### Delete a notebook

<Callout variant="caution">
  A notebook will remain saved in the system until it is explicitly deleted by following these steps.
</Callout>

1. On the notebook index list, click the three-dot action menu for the notebook you wish to delete.
2. Select the **Delete** option.
3. Confirm the deletion by selecting **Delete** again.

## Notebook permissions

### Organization association

Every notebook is a resource that belongs to the organization in which it was created. This association is permanent. If the organization is deleted, the notebook is deleted as well.

<Callout variant="tip">
  Notebooks currently do not have permission settings. Anyone in the organization who has access to the feature can create new notebooks, edit and delete existing ones. We are working on introducing granular permissions allowing users to decide who within the organization sees, edits and deletes particular notebooks.
