<Callout title="Preview feature">
  We're still actively developing notebooks, but we're excited for you to try this powerful new feature! This feature is currently provided as part of a preview program pursuant to our [pre-release policies](/docs/licenses/license-information/referenced-policies/new-relic-pre-release-policy/).
</Callout>

When investigating complex issues or sharing insights with your team, you often find yourself jumping between different tools, copying queries, taking screenshots, and struggling to maintain context as you piece together a complete story from your data. Traditional dashboards are great for monitoring, but they fall short when you need to document investigations, create detailed post-mortems, or build step-by-step analytical workflows.

Notebooks solve this problem by providing a dynamic and organized way to tell a complete story with your data. They are structured, data-driven documents that let you combine queries, visualizations, and descriptive text into a single, shareable asset, eliminating the need to switch between multiple tools or lose important context during your analysis.

## Use cases

Use notebooks to improve your workflow and turn raw data into actionable stories:

* **Query, analyze, and visualize data**: Seamlessly query all your observability data (logs, metrics, events) and create visualizations to gain a better understanding of your system's performance.
* **Create post-mortems and incident documents**: Collaborate with your team to document investigations and create a clear, reusable record for incident post-mortems and root cause analysis.
* **Build reusable workflows and runbooks**: Create and share step-by-step guides for complex analysis, using variables to ensure consistent and repeatable processes.
* **Add context and narrative**: Use Markdown to easily add detailed titles, notes, and explanations to your queries and charts, transforming disconnected data points into a cohesive story.
* **Stay in one place, unifying your data**: Seamlessly query your observability, security and business data without switching between different tools or tabs with the power of New Relic Lens.

## How notebooks work

Notebooks are built using individual blocks that you can arrange and rearrange to tell your data story. This modular approach gives you complete flexibility to create everything from simple queries with context to complex analytical workflows.

### The building blocks

Every notebook is composed of different types of blocks:

* **Query blocks**: Run [NRQL queries](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/) and display visualizations using any of the available [chart types](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/use-charts/chart-types/)
* **Text blocks**: Add context, explanations, and documentation using Markdown formatting
* **Variables**: Create dynamic, reusable parameters that work across multiple blocks in the same notebook

### Interactive workflow

As you build your notebook, you can:

* **Edit blocks in real-time**: Click any block to make it active and start editing
* **Organize your story**: Duplicate, move, or delete blocks to create the perfect narrative flow
* **Collaborate seamlessly**: Share your notebook with your team and work together on investigations

This flexible structure means you start with a simple query and gradually build a comprehensive document that captures your entire analytical process.

## Notebook blocks

Blocks are the fundamental building units of a notebook. They are individual sections you add to structure your analysis and narrative.

### Query blocks

Use query blocks to write [NRQL queries](/docs/nrql/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/) and visualize the results. All single query [chart types](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/use-charts/chart-types/) and customizations available in the standard query builder are supported in notebooks.

### Text blocks

Use Markdown to add rich text, titles, context, explanations, and descriptive text to tell the story of your investigation.

### Block actions

Every block can be manipulated to organize your document:

* **Duplicate**: Create a copy of the block
* **Delete**: Remove the block from your notebook
* **Move Up/Down**: Reorder blocks within your notebook
* **Move to Top/Bottom**: Quickly move blocks to the beginning or end

## Notebooks permissions

Before you start creating notebooks, it's important to understand how permissions work and who will have access to your notebooks.

### Organization association

Every notebook is a resource that belongs to the organization in which it was created. This association is permanent and cannot be changed. Notebooks cannot be shared between different organizations. If the organization is deleted, the notebook is deleted as well. If a user moves to a different organization, they will not have access to notebooks from their previous organization.

### Current permissions model

<Callout variant="tip">
  Notebooks currently do not have granular permission settings. Anyone in the organization who has access to the feature can create new notebooks, edit and delete existing ones.
</Callout>

**Current capabilities:**
* All organization members with notebooks access can view all notebooks
* All organization members with notebooks access can create, edit, and delete any notebook
* Notebooks are automatically shared across your entire organization

## Get started with notebooks

Now that you understand how notebooks work and their permissions model, you're ready to start creating and managing your own notebooks.

### Access notebooks

To access notebooks:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com)**.
2. Open the **Query your data** console from the drawer at the bottom of the page.
3. Click **Notebooks** in the query builder header to see a list of all notebooks created by your organization.

You have two simple ways to start a new notebook:

### Start from the notebooks index

1. Select the **+ Create a notebook** button at the top-right corner of the index.
2. Give your notebook a meaningful name (names are searchable, so use relevant keywords like your service or application name).
3. Click **Create**.
4. The query console drawer opens. Type your first query!

### Start from the query console

1. Open the query console (the drawer at the bottom of the platform).
2. Create your desired queries and Markdown blocks.
3. Click the **Save**.
4. Name your notebook, and click **Save**.

### Search and sort notebooks

To find specific notebooks in your organization:

1. **Search by name**: Use the search bar at the top of the notebooks index to find notebooks by name or keywords.
2. **Sort notebooks**: Click the sort dropdown to organize notebooks by:
   * Name (A-Z or Z-A)
   * Last modified date (newest or oldest first)
   * Created date (newest or oldest first)
   * Favorites (starred notebooks appear first)
3. **Filter by favorites**: Click the star filter to show only your favorite notebooks.

### Duplicate a notebook

1. Open the notebook you want to duplicate.
2. Click the arrow next to the tab name in the console drawer and click **duplicate**.
3. Click **Duplicate** from the context menu.
4. A copy of the notebook will open in a new tab, ready for editing.

### Mark a notebook as favorite

To quickly find your most important notebooks, you can mark them as a favorite:

1. Click the star icon next to a notebook's name in the index page.
2. The icon will turn yellow, and the notebook will be grouped at the top of the index list.
3. Click the star icon again to remove it from your favorites.

<Callout variant="caution">
  Deleting a notebook is permanent and cannot be undone. Once deleted, the notebook and all its content are permanently removed from the system. Make sure to duplicate any notebooks you want to preserve before deleting.
</Callout>

1. On the notebook index list, click the three-dot action menu for the notebook you wish to delete.
2. Select the **Delete** option.
3. Confirm the deletion by selecting **Delete** again.
