Public dashboards in New Relic allow you to share your custom dashboards with individuals outside your organization, even if they don't have a New Relic account. 
This feature helps expand the audience for your insights while maintaining security controls and auditing capabilities. The shared dashboard is accessible through a unique link that you can create and share with external users.
When the external user access the shared dashboard, the page is rendered with the same data and visualizations as the original dashboard, with the only interactive capability to adjust the time range. 
Each time the shared dashboard is accessed, it consumes your CCU.
