You can build your own visualizations and add them to a dashboard. This gives you great flexibility around what you display on dashboards, from a company logo to custom queries from any data source.

  This visualization shows the number of people in each city who are viewing New Relic within an organization. The visualization was created using the New Relic CLI and [Treemap from the Recharts library](https://bit.dev/recharts/recharts/treemap?example=5ced12842b76410014e81f11).

The process for creating a visualization is covered in the guide, [Build a custom visualization for dashboards](https://developer.newrelic.com/build-apps/build-visualization).
