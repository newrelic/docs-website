When you share dashboards or charts publicly via live URLs, it exposes sensitive data to external viewers, so it's critical to manage access and permissions carefully. Ensure you have the following setups as per your requirement to securely share dashboards and charts. 

Each of the following personas has specific responsibilities in this process:
* **Authentication domain manager**: Controls the feature's enablement organization-wide.
* **Administrator**: Configures custom roles and permissions for users to manage live URLs.

## Feature enablement [#feature-enablement]



## Access management [#access-management]

As an Administrator perform the following steps to grant access to a user for [managing live dashboard and chart URLs](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/share-charts-dashbords-externally). Check with the user about there specific needs and accordingly do the configuration. To learn more about user management, see [User management tutorial](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/account-user-mgmt-tutorial/).

<Steps>

  <Step>
    ### Add permissions to a custom role [#permissions-to-custom-role]
    [Create a new custom role](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/account-user-mgmt-tutorial/#roles) with the following permissions, or add them to an existing role. Check with the user to understand the level of access required. 
       * `Live Chart Url (all)`: Access details of live URLs for all users.
           * `View`: Can see all live URL details.
           * `Delete`: Can revoke any live URLs.
       * `Live Chart Url (individual)`: Access details of live URLs owned by the user.
            * `View`: Can see own live URL details.
           * `Modify`: Can update the time period of the URLs to remain live.
           * `Delete`: Can revoke own live URLs.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ## Add user, role, and account to a group [#group-access]
    [Create a new group](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/account-user-mgmt-tutorial/#group-access) for dashboard sharing, or manage an existing group to set up as following:
        1. Add the user under <DNT>**Members**</DNT>.
        2. Associate the custom role with the desired account under <DNT>**Account access**</DNT> for dashboard sharing.
        3. If the dashboard data spans multiple accounts, include the custom role for each relevant account within the group.
  </Step>
