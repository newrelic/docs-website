To share a dashboard publicly, you must meet all prerequisites to ensure security and compliance with organizational policies. 
Public dashboards expose sensitive data to external viewers, so it's critical to manage access and permissions carefully. 
Each of the following personas has specific responsibilities in this process:
* **Authentication domain manager**: Enables or disables the feature at the organisation level.
* **Administrator**: Configures custom roles and permissions for users in account level to create, share, and revoke public dashboards links.

## Feature enablement
To enable the public dashboard sharing feature, reach out Authentication domain manager to enable it at the organization level.

As a Authentication Domain Manager, perform the following steps:


## Access management
Reach out to the Administrator to grant your access to necessary accounts, and roles for using the public dasboard sharing feature.

As an Administrator, go to <DNT>**[one.newrelic.com > Acccess Management](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal/organizations/organization-detail)**</DNT> and perform the following steps. To learn more about user management, see [User management tutorial](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/account-user-mgmt-tutorial/).

           * `View`: User can see all the shared dashboard details.
           * `Delete`: User can revoke all the shared dashboard links.

    Under <DNT>**Groups**</DNT>, [create a new group](/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-user-management/account-user-mgmt-tutorial/#group-access) for dashboard sharing, or manage an existing group to set up as following:
        1. Under <DNT>**Members**</DNT>, add the user to the group.
        2. Under <DNT>**Account access**</DNT> add the custom role with the account in which you want to enable dashboard sharing.
