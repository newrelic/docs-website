The Public API Performance dashboard is a dashboard supported by New Relic’s [Global Performance data sets](/docs/query-your-data/new-relic-one-dashboards/global-performance-dataset/new-relic-global-performance-data-sets). It’s an out-of-the-box dashboard included as part of your New Relic account. It provides both actionable general insights about the performance of public APIs and an opportunity for new customers to test-drive New Relic’s dashboarding capabilities before adding their own data.

The dashboard works by showing real latencies experienced by an anonymized sampling of New Relic customers when accessing popular public APIs.
