Access any of your [New Relic One dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data.

Once you have customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data.

## Customize your dashboard [#dash-manage]

Dashboards are highly flexible: you can tailor your dashboard layout and arrange chart sizes to optimize how you see your data.

![Dashboards configuration menu](./images/dashboards_menu_20210623.png "Dashboards configuration menu.png")

<Callout variant="tip">
  Click the <Icon name="fe-tag"/> icon to access the **See metadata and manage tags** modal. There you can see the dashboard's GUID, account ID, and App ID, and manage all the tags that have been added to the dashboard.
</Callout>

Dashboards features include:

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="dash-edit"
    title="Edit your dashboard"
  >
    Use the edit <Icon name="fe-edit-2"/>
    button to:

    * Copy the dashboard's permalink.
    * Rename your dashboard. Names are searchable, so we recommend giving it a meaningful name.
    * Create new content by clicking the **Add widget** button. Add a new chart using the [query builder](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder), or add text, images, or links using our [markdown editor](#markdown).
    * Resize and rearrange charts. You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="dash-settings"
    title="Settings menu"
  >
    Use the settings menu on the upper right corner:

    * To change the name of the dashboard. [Names are searchable](/docs/dashboards/explore-dashboards-index/explore-dashboards-index#search-dashboards), so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily.
    * To modify the [dashboard's permissions](/docs/dashboards/explore-dashboards-index/explore-dashboards-index#dashboards-permission).

    At the settings menu you can also see [when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to](/docs/dashboards/explore-dashboards-index/explore-dashboards-index#see-dashboards). These values cannot be modified.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="dash-visual-tv"
    title="TV mode"
  >
    You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen.

    There are two ways to turn on TV mode:

    * When viewing a dashboard in New Relic One, select the <Icon name="fe-tv"/>
      icon at the top right.
    * Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: `&platform[tvMode]=true`

    To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, select the <Icon name="fe-settings"/>
    icon. Options include:

    * **Dashboard name display.** Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen.
    * **Page cycle.** For [dashboards with multiple pages](#), this automatically cycles from page to page.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="dash-visual-dark-full"
    title="Dark mode"
  >
    High-contrast mode is available in dashboards. Select the <Icon name="fe-moon"/>
    icon from the upper right menu bar.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="dash-json"
    title="Copy your dashboard as JSON"
  >
    You can copy your dashboard as JSON and add it to the clipboard by clicking on the **&lt;/&gt;** icon on the right corner.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="dash-esport"
    title="Export your dashboard"
  >
    You can export your dashboard as a pdf file clicking the <Icon name="fe-download"/>
    icon.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="dash-clone"
    title="Duplicate your dashboard"
  >
    You can duplicate your dashboard clicking the duplicate
    icon regardless of your permission levels. The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the [index](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#get-started). The duplicate has [**Public - Read and write** permissions](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#dashboards-permissions). Access the new, duplicated dashboard by clicking on the message that pops up on your screen.
    
    The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named `This is my dashboard`, the duplicate is called `This is my dashboard copy`. You can change the name when you duplicate it.
    
    You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time.
  </Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

<Callout variant="tip">
  You can use the [search](/docs/new-relic-one-core-ui-components) feature at any time to search data across [New Relic One](/docs/new-relic-one/use-new-relic-one/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one).
</Callout>

## Add new content to your dashboard [#dash-create-chart]

There are multiple ways to add new content to your dashboard:

* From the [data explorer](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/data-explorer/introduction-data-explorer) and [query builder](/docs/introduction-chart-builder) features.
* Use the **+ Add to your dashboard** button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the [query builder](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder), or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our [Markdown editor](#dash-create-chart).
* [Copy an existing chart](#dash-manage-charts) from any dashboard.

If you experience issues adding new content, [check our error messages](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/dashboards-charts-import-export-data/#chart-error-messages).

### Add custom content using the markdown editor [#markdown]

The Markdown editor contains a **Markdown** pane, where you enter your content, as well as a **Preview** pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the [Commonmark website](https://commonmark.org/help/).

You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/>
icon on any markdown widget and selecting **Edit**.

## Organize your dashboards with pages [#add-pages]

You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI.

![dashboards_pages.png](./images/dashboards_pages.png "dashboards_pages.png")

<figcaption>
  **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) > Dashboards**: This is an example of a dashboard in New Relic One with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions.
</figcaption>

You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject.

For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries.

We offer other features to connect dashboards:

* [Create widgets containing markdown text](#markdown) to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards.
* Use [facet filtering](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/manage-your-dashboard/filter-new-relic-one-dashboards-facets) to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards.
* Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names.

In New Relic Insights, this feature was called [data apps](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/data-apps-build-collections-linked-dashboards). For more about switching from Insights to New Relic One, see our [transition guide](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/transition-new-relic-one-dashboards-insights).

### Add and edit pages to a dashboard [#add-pages-edit]

To add or edit a page in a dashboard:

1. From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the <Icon name="fe-edit-2"/>
   icon.
2. Add a new page:
   * Select **Add a page** to add a blank page.
   * Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a dashboard name, and selecting **Duplicate**.
3. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other [dashboard editing tasks](#dash-manage).
4. When finished, select **Done editing.**

## Manage your charts and markdown content [#dash-manage-charts]

From any markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to:

* Expand your chart to full screen.
* [Share your chart](#dash-export) as an image or with a link.
* Copy the chart to any dashboard.
* For table charts only, export as a `.csv` file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis.  
* Create an alert condition.
* Open the [NRQL console](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/nrql-console/) to see or edit the query associated to the chart.
* Duplicate the chart.
* Delete the chart.

<Callout variant="important">
  You cannot edit the query of a chart if you have **Read only** permissions to the dashboard.
</Callout>

Learn more about [how to use your charts](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/use-charts/use-your-charts).

## Filter and refine your charts [#dash-search]

You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions:

* Use the **filter bar** to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts.
* Open the **advanced filter bar** to access the boolean operators (such as `=`, `!=`, `CONTAINS`, `EXCLUDES`, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data.

After applying the filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates how many filters are being applied at a time.

To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it.

## Filter using the chart legend [#filter-legend]

Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only and remove the rest of them from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze.

Use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows) for the opposite behavior: removing the selected series and keeping the rest.

## Filter dashboards using facets

If a chart's NRQL query contains a `FACET` clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For details, see [Filter by facets](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/manage-your-dashboard/filter-new-relic-one-dashboards-facets).

## Use the time picker to adjust time settings [#dash-time-picker]

By default, each chart in the dashboard will show data for the time period specified when they were [created in the query builder](/docs/introduction-chart-builder). However, you can use the time picker to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period.

The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see [Chart refresh intervals](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/insights-chart-refresh-intervals).

To change the time range:

* Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from `Last 30 minutes` to `Last 7 days`).
* Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu.

<Callout variant="important">
  In dashboards, unlike Insights, the time zone is independent from your laptop's time. You can set the time zone you want to use in your **user preferences**, easily accessible from the custom menu in the time picker.
</Callout>

## Export and share your data [#dash-export]

It is very easy to export dashboard and chart data and share it within your company and beyond:

* You can export any dashboard as a PDF file, using the **Export dashboard as PDF** button located in the upper right menu bar.
* You can also share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link. Go to the chart menu and select either the **Get as image** or **Get chart link** options.
