Access any of your [New Relic dashboards](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/get-started/introduction-new-relic-one-dashboards) to create or manage your charts directly from the chart menu, customize your dashboard's layout, adjust display modes, or export your data.

Once you've customized your dashboard and built your charts, use our advanced visualization features and tools for data exploration to correlate and analyze your data.

## Customize your dashboard [#dash-manage]

Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Dashboards** to open the dashboards page.

  Go to **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Dashboards** to open the Dashboard index.
</figcaption>

Click a dashboard to open its charts. A dashboard page includes these features:

<CollapserGroup>
<Collapser
    id="dash-clone"
    title="Duplicate your dashboard"
  >
    You can duplicate your dashboard regardless of your permission levels. Click the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon on the right corner and select **Duplicate dashboard**.

    The duplicated dashboard is named like the original dashboard followed by the word “copy”. For example, if you duplicate a dashboard named `This is my dashboard`, the duplicate is called `This is my dashboard copy`. You can change the name, select the associated account, and add the permissions when you duplicate it. Once you click **Create**, you'll see a pop-up message on your screen to access the duplicated dashboard. You can edit the name and other properties of the dashboard, such as permissions, any time.
    
    The dashboard is automatically copied and the duplicate is added to the [index](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#get-started). The duplicate has [**Public - Read and write** permissions](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#dashboards-permissions). 
    
  </Collapser>
<Collapser
    id="dash-edit"
    title="Edit your dashboard"
  >
    You can edit a dashboard if you have [permissions](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#dashboards-permissions) to do it.

    Use the edit <Icon name="fe-edit-2"/> button to:

    * Copy the dashboard's permalink.
    * Rename your dashboard. [Names are searchable](#dashboards-search), so we recommend giving a meaningful name using words that will help you locate your dashboard easily.
    * Create new content by clicking the **+ Add widget** button. Add a new chart using the [query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder/), or add text, images, or links using our [Markdown editor](#markdown).
    * Resize and rearrange [charts](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/use-charts/use-your-charts/). You can move any chart and put it anywhere in the dashboard so the layout you set fits your preferences: place your more relevant charts on top, or drop less used charts in a corner. You can set up to 12 columns of charts.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="dash-export"
    title="Export your dashboard"
  >
    You can export your dashboard as a pdf file. Click the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon on the right corner and select **Export dashboard as PDF**. A new tab on your browser opens with your PDF.

    Exporting to PDF or as an image changes the display depending on the chart type.

  </Collapser>

<Collapser
    id="dash-json"
    title="Import your dashboard as JSON"
  >
    You can import your dashboard as JSON code and add it to the clipboard. Click the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon on the right corner and select **Copy JSON to clipboard**. See how to [import a dashboard](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#dashboards-import).
  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    id="dashboards-metadata"
    title="See metadata"
  >

  Inside a dasboard, click the 'metadata' button to access the **metadata** widget. There you can see the dashboard's entity GUID, account ID, account name, and manage all the tags added to the dashboard.


<img
  width="50%;"
  title="Dashboards: See metadata"
  alt="Dashboards: See metadata"
  src={dashboardsDashboardMetadata}
/>

  From the dashboard index, there is the [**See metadata & tags**](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#dashboards-metadata) option to see the metadata of a dashboard.
  
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="dashboards-tags"
    title="See tags"
  >

  Inside a dasboard, click the 'tags' button to access the **tags** widget. There you can see the dashboard's account ID, account name, email of the person who created it, permissions, and the ID of the trusted account.


<img
  width="50%;"
  title="Dashboards: See tags"
  alt="Dashboards: See tags"
  src={dashboardsDashboardTags}
/>

  From the dashboard index, there is the [**See metadata & tags**](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#dashboards-metadata) option to see the tags of a dashboard.
  
  </Collapser>



<Collapser
    id="dash-settings"
    title="Settings menu"
  >
  Click the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon on the right corner and select **Settings**.
  
  <img
      width="40%;"
      title="Dashboards: Settings menu"
      alt="Dashboards: Settings menu"
      src={dashboardsSettingsMenu}
    />
  
  This option allows you:

      * To change the name of the dashboard. [Names are searchable](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#dashboards-search), so we recommend giving it a meaningful name that will help you locate your dashboard easily.
      * To modify the [dashboard's permissions](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards/#dashboards-permissions).


  At the settings menu you can also see when the dashboard was created and the account it belongs to. These values can't be modified.

    <img
      width="30%;"
      title="Dashboards: Settings options"
      alt="Dashboards: Settings options"
      src={dashboardsSettingsOptions}
    />

  </Collapser>
  <Collapser
    id="template-variables"
    title="Template variables"
  >
    You can use template variables to dynamically filter your dashboards. Template variables give you and your dashboard users greater control over adjusting what your dashboards show. See [Template variables](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/dashboard-template-variables).
  </Collapser> 

  <Collapser
    id="dash-visual-tv"
    title="TV mode"
  >
  You can enable a full-screen TV mode that optimizes the dashboard for display on a television screen.

  There're two ways to turn on TV mode:

      * When viewing a dashboard, select the <Icon name="fe-monitor"/> icon at the top right.

      * Add this parameter to a dashboard page URL: `&tv-mode`


  To configure TV mode, from a dashboard, click the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon on the right corner and select **Settings**. Under the TV mode section, there're these options:

      * **Display the name of the dashboard**. Turning off the dashboard name gives the dashboard charts more space on the screen.

      * **Show time picker**. Use this option to change the [time range](#dash-time-picker) of the data on display.

      * **Cycle to the next page every 20 seconds**. If the dashboard includes [several pages](#add-pages), you'll see this option.


  These options are available if you've the permission in the dashboard.

    <img
      width="30%;"

## Manage dashboards via API [#api]

For how to create and manage dashboards via API, see [NerdGraph: Configure dashboards](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/nerdgraph-dashboards).

## Add new content to your dashboard [#dash-create-chart]

Here's a few ways to add new content to your dashboard:

* From [metrics and events](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/data-explorer/introduction-data-explorer) and [query builder](/docs/introduction-chart-builder).
* Use the **+ Add to your dashboard** button (accessible from the main dashboard page or in the edit mode) to access the [query builder](/docs/chart-builder/use-chart-builder/get-started/introduction-chart-builder), or to add content (such as text, links, or images) using our [Markdown editor](#dash-create-chart).
* [Copy an existing chart](#dash-manage-charts) from any dashboard.

If you experience issues adding new content, [check our error messages](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/dashboards-charts-import-export-data/#chart-error-messages).

### Add custom content using the Markdown editor [#markdown]

Add context and flair to your dashboard with custom content using our Markdown editor. With this feature, you can add formatted text, checklists, images, code snippets, and more. This makes it easy to explain shared dashboards, add useful hyperlinks, create task lists, and create any other rich content you need.

The Markdown editor contains a **Markdown** pane, where you enter your content, and a **Preview** pane, where you can view it. For more information about Markdown syntax options, see the [GitHub's Markdown guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

You can also edit existing content by clicking the ellipses <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/>
icon on any Markdown widget and selecting **Edit**.

Learn more about what you can do with the Markdown widget in the short video below (approx. 3:11 minutes):
<Video

  type="youtube"
/>

## Organize your dashboards with pages [#add-pages]

You can use multiple pages to organize your dashboard data in different views. When you add more pages to that dashboard, you can access these pages using the tabs at the top of the dashboard UI.

<img
  title="Dashboard with multiple pages"
  alt="Dashboard with multiple pages"
  src={dashboardsMultiPageDashboard}
/>

<figcaption>
  **[one.newrelic.com > All capabilities](https://one.newrelic.com/all-capabilities) > Dashboards**: This is an example of a dashboard with multiple pages, represented by the tabs at the top of the dashboard. You can add pages to dashboards, copy existing pages, and drag and drop the page tabs to new positions.
</figcaption>

You can use this feature to group together related dashboard views. This is valuable when you're aggregating a lot of data and charts related to a specific project, team, or subject.

For example, a mobile app team might build a dashboard focused on app performance by country. The first dashboard page might be an overview of performance across all countries, with other pages focused on specific countries.

There's other features to connect dashboards:

* [Create widgets containing Markdown text](#markdown) to add direct links to specific UI pages or dashboards.
* Use [facet filtering](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/manage-your-dashboard/filter-new-relic-one-dashboards-facets) to create links that automatically link to and filter other dashboards.
* Use the dashboard search to find similarly named dashboards. To take advantage of this, you can add team- or project-specific words/phrases to dashboard names.

### Add and edit pages to a dashboard [#add-pages-edit]

To add or edit a page in a dashboard:

1. From a new or existing dashboard, enter edit mode by selecting the <Icon name="fe-edit-2"/> icon. Depending on the permissions of the dashboard, you'll see this icon or not.
2. Add a new page:
   * Select **Add a page** to add a blank page.
   * Clone an existing page by clicking the dropdown next to a page name, and selecting **Duplicate Page**.
3. While in edit mode, you can add widgets to the new page, drag and drop page tabs to new locations, and do other [dashboard editing tasks](#dash-manage-charts).
4. When you finish, select **Done editing**.

## Manage your charts and Markdown content [#dash-manage-charts]

From any Markdown element, access the menu on the upper right corner to edit or delete it. From any chart, access the chart action menu on the upper right corner to:

* Expand your chart to full screen.
* [Share your chart](#dash-export) as an image or with a link.
* For table charts only, export as a `.csv` file. You can import this file into other apps like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to do further analysis.
* View the query.
* Copy the chart to any dashboard.
* Open the [NRQL console](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/nrql-console/) to see or edit the query associated to the chart.
* Duplicate the chart.
* Delete the chart.

<img

  title="Chart action menu on the Dashboard page"
  alt="Chart action menu on the Dashboard page"
  src={dashboardsChartActionMenu}
/>

<Callout variant="important">
  You can't edit the query of a chart if you have **Read only** permissions to the dashboard.
</Callout>

Learn more about [how to use your charts](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/use-charts/use-your-charts).

## Filter and refine your charts [#dash-search]

You can narrow down the information on display using the filtering function, which is a visual representation of query conditions:

* Use the **filter bar** to select the values or attributes you want to see, and remove the rest of the elements from the charts.
* Open the **advanced filter bar** to access the boolean operators (such as `=`, `!=`, `CONTAINS`, `EXCLUDES`, etc.) and add compound and complex conditions for filtering data.

After applying a filter, your dashboard will only show the data associated to the elements you selected. A small counter indicates the number of filters applied at a time.

To return to the default view, click on the small cross by the filter to remove it.

## Filter using the chart legend [#filter-legend]

Click on a legend in any chart with legends to see that series only, and remove the rest of series from the chart. This helps you isolate the data you want to analyze.

To do the opposite, use CMD (in a Mac) or CTRL (in Windows): This will remove the selected series, and keep the rest.

## Filter dashboards using facets [#filter-facets]

If a chart's NRQL query contains a `FACET` clause, you can use the faceted attributes to filter the current dashboard or another related dashboard. For more details, see [Filter by facets](/docs/dashboards/new-relic-one-dashboards/manage-your-dashboard/filter-new-relic-one-dashboards-facets).

## Use the time picker to adjust time settings [#dash-time-picker]

By default, each chart in the dashboard show data for the time period specified when they were created in the [query builder](/docs/introduction-chart-builder). However, you can use the [time picker](/docs/new-relic-solutions/get-started/glossary/#time-picker) to change the time range of the data on display and set the same range for all charts. This is particularly useful while troubleshooting incidents, if you need to narrow down your data to observe what happened in a specific time period.

<img
  width="50%;"
  title="Time picker on the Dashboard page"
  alt="Time picker on the Dashboard page"
  src={dashboardsTimePicker}
/>


The refresh rate depends on the duration of the time window you are viewing. For more information and examples, see [Chart refresh intervals](/docs/insights/use-insights-ui/manage-dashboards/insights-chart-refresh-intervals).

To change the time range:

* Select one of the available options from the dropdown menu (ranging from last `5 minutes` to last `6 months`).
* Customize the time range with specific start and end timestamps using the custom menu.

If you don't want to change the time range of a chart when using the time picker:

1. Click the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon and select **Edit**.
2. Open the **Dashboard Options** menu in the customizations UI.
3. Set the **Ignore time picker** toggle to on or off depending on your need.


## Export and share your data [#export-share]

You can export your dashboard and chart data to share it:

* Export any dashboard as a PDF file clicking the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon on the right corner and select **Export dashboard as PDF**.
* Share your charts either as a PNG image or as a link: Click the <Icon name="fe-more-horizontal"/> icon on the right corner of the chart and select either the **Get as image** or **Get chart link** options.

Exporting to PDF or as an image has certain limitations depending on the chart type.

## Recover deleted dashboard [#deleted]

If you delete your dashboard, you can quickly restore it with NerdGraph. To learn how, read the [Support forum post](https://discuss.newrelic.com/t/relic-solution-using-nerdgraph-to-recover-a-deleted-dashboard/142855), or watch this short video (2:14 minutes).

## Key visual tools [#key-visual-tools]

Dashboards offer intuitive visualization features and tools for advanced data exploration and fast troubleshooting.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    id="key-visual-coloring"
    title="Consistent chart coloring"
  >
    So that you can quickly see and correlate your data, facets that you apply to more than one chart in a dashboard have a consistent facet color across all the charts.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="key-visual-needle"
    title="Correlated needle"
  >
    When you mouse over one chart, the correlated needle overlays across all charts or data points in the dashboard at the same time. The tooltip provides the relevant data points from the selected facet, such as maximum and minimum values in a line chart. It also highlights the selected attribute in a pie chart.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="key-visual-scrubber"
    title="Data scrubber"
  >
    The chart scrubber helps you select a data point or facet in a chart when the chart is too crowded and facets are too close to each other.

    Mouse along the needle to smoothly select the adjacent facets and view their associated data points. You can also lighten a heavily populated chart by unselecting one or more of the attributes that appear in the UI.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="key-visual-zoom"
    title="Brush to zoom"
  >
    Drag to select a time segment on any chart and you automatically zoom to that time period on all the charts in the dashboard.

    The time picker reflects the new period on display in the dashboard. You can return to the default or any other time settings at any time.
  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    id="key-visual-zoom"
    title="Custom visualizations"
  >
    You can also make custom visualizations for your dashboards. These enable you to include information from any data source. To learn more about working with custom visualizations, see [Build a custom visualization for dashboards](https://developer.newrelic.com/build-apps/build-visualization) and [Add custom visualizations to your dashboards](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/add-custom-visualizations-your-dashboards).
