For custom dashboards, you can use **template variables** to dynamically filter charts and other widgets. Template variables help make your dashboards more useful, and help you more easily create dashboards you can reuse for different use cases. 

## Why use template variables? [#defined]

Template variables are a powerful and dynamic way of filtering an entire dashboard based on specific metadata values a dashboard creator chooses. The benefits of using template variables are: 

* They make dashboards easier to use: your users don't have to understand the structure of the data, but can simply choose from various filter options you've set. 
* They allow you to create reusable dashboard templates, which you can then duplicate and adjust for many other uses. 

Here's an example of a dashboard with several template variables, which you can see at the top of the dashboard.

<img
  title="Dashboard with template variables"
  alt="Dashboard with template variables"
  src={dashboardsDashboardWithTemplateVariables}
/>

With template variables, you can set up a wide variety of variables and filters to create the dashboard experience you need. Examples of experiences you can create: 

* A dropdown to choose an app name 
* A dropdown to choose specific regions 
* A dropdown to select specific durations or other numeric values
* Filters that use free text fields to find matching strings

## Requirements and limitations [#requirements]

Template variables can only be used in the context of making widgets for custom dashboards. See [NRQL variables](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#with-as-nrql-var) for using variables in a NRQL query.

Queries with template variables can only be used in the context of a dashboard. For this reason, some query-related features don't work. For example, the `Export dashboard as PDF` option doesn't support widgets with variables.

Important points to note about adding a query: 

    * The variable you defined goes inside the `{{ â€¦ }}` brackets. 
    * The variable generates a string value.
    * To help you when you're creating a query, there's a color code:
        * Clauses, `from`, `select`, `facet`, and `where`, are in pink.
        * Identifiers are in black.
        * Functions are in blue.
        * Strings are in green.
        * Integers are in brown.

    * See our [How to use NRQL: the mechanics of querying](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/introduction-nrql-how-nrql-works/#syntax) page if you want to know more about writing queries with NRQL.

For restrictions related to writing queries, see [Writing queries](#query-variable-rules).

## Use template variables [#create-variables]

We'll walk you through creating a template variable, and then we'll give you a few [examples](#examples) of different kinds of template variables. 

Creating a template variable consists of two steps.

<CollapserGroup>
<Collapser
    id="step1"
    title="Step 1. Define the template variable"
    >

First, you'll define a template variable. This is the variable that you'll use in a NRQL query to create a widget. 

To define a variable: 

1. From a new dashboard without variables, click the edit <Icon name="fe-edit-2"/> button, and then, click **+ Add variable** button located at the top-left corner. Once you've finished adding variables, click **Done editing**.

  If the dashboard includes widgets, click the **+ Add variable** button.

<img
  title="Dashboard without widgets"
  alt="Dashboard without widgets"
  src={dashboardsAddVariable}
/>

2. Complete the **Add variable** workflow. Below are some rules and tips for each of the fields.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width={200}>
        **Field**
      </th>

      <th>
        **Details**
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Name to use in queries
      </td>

      <td>
        The name of the variable. This is what you'll use in the query, surrounded by `{{...}}`. For example, if you use `country` here as the name, then when writing a query you'll call the variable with `{{country}}`. 

        Variable names must start with a letter and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Display name
      </td>

      <td>
        Optional. This is how the variable will display above the dashboard so that dashboard users know what the variable represents. If this is left blank, it will use the main name value. 
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Type
      </td>

      <td>
There are three options: 
* **Query**: You can write a query that will return a dynamic list of options used in the dropdown menu. For example, the following query would return a dynamic list of `country` values:
  
  ```sql
  SELECT uniques(countryCode) FROM PageAction since 2 days ago
  ```
  For rules and tips on writing queries, see [Query-type variables](#query-variable-rules).
* **List**: A list of comma-separated values that are used to populate the options in the dropdown menu. For example, you could manually define a list of `country` values using a list like: `ES, US, CA.`
* **Text field**: Instead of a dropdown of values to choose from, this allows dashboard users to filter for whatever text they input. 
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Account
      </td>

      <td>
        Only present for `query` type. For organizations with multiple accounts, this sets the account that is queried. 
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Query
      </td>

      <td>
        Write here your query using `uniques (attribute)`. 
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Multi-select
      </td>

      <td>
        Optional. This option allows a dropdown to allow multiple selections at the same time instead of a single selection.
      </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>
        Default values
      </td>

      <td>
        Optional. These are the defaults value that the dashboard will filter on. For example, if you used the `country` query above, you could input `ES` as the default value and the dashboard would automatically filter to that value. You can also select all possibilities.
        
        To use multiple values on a `WHERE` clause you need to use [`IN`](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#sel-where) instead of `=`.
      </td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
      <td>
        Output format
      </td>

      <td>
        This lets you change how the data generated by the variable is handled in the query. The selected option you choose here is related to the query you're going to add later in the widget. The **default** option is string because this is the more common option used in the majority of queries. You can change the **default** option to one of these:
          * **String**: Use this when the variable will produce a string. 
          * **Number**: Use this when it will product a numeric value.
          * **Identifier**: Use this when you want to substitute parts of the query, like event names or facet names.

      </td>
    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>

See this example of what a template variable for `country` values would look like:

<img
  width="40%;"
  title="Define a template variable"
  alt="Define a template variable"
  src={dashboardsExampleAddVariableCountry}
/>

Once you've defined your template variable, you can add a widget that uses your created template variable. 
</Collapser>
<Collapser
    id="step2"
    title="Step 2. Create widgets that use the template variable"
    >

Once you've configured a template variable, you'll need widgets on a dashboard that use the variable that you've defined in their query.

To create a widget: 

1. From your dashboard click **+ Add widget** button located at the top-right corner.

2. There are 2 options:
    * Add a chart. You'll create your widget using the [query builder](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/query-builder/introduction-query-builder/).
    * Add text, images, or links. You'll create your widget adding your own content using our [Markdown editor](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/manage-your-dashboard/#markdown).

3. We choose **Add a chart** option.

4. Add your query and click **Run**. 

    Following our example mentioned in step 1:

    ```sql
    SELECT countryCode FROM PageAction WHERE countryCode IN ({{countryCode}})
    ```

    <img
      title="Example of adding a widget"
      alt="Example of adding a widget"
      src={dashboardsExampleAddWidget}
    />

5. Click **Save**

</Collapser>
</CollapserGroup>

When you're done defining a template variable and adding a widget that references that variable, you can verify it's working as expected by choosing different options from the template variable bar and seeing if the widget changes based on your selection. 

Here's an example of the resulting widget, on the right, with the `country` dropdown to the left.
<img
  title="Country template variable example"
  alt="Country template variable example"
  src={dashboardsCountryVariableExample}
/>


## Rules for writing a query-type template variable [#query-variable-rules]

As discussed in the [section on defining template variables](#step1), there are three variable types: query, list, and text field. The query-type variable is the most complex to create because you must create a working query that returns values, which are then used to populate the dropdown in the template variable bar at the top of the dashboard. 

<Callout variant="important">
Note that this is a different topic than writing queries that make use of a template variable.
</Callout>

Here are some rules and guidance on creating a query-type variable: 
* Queries must use the `uniques` or `keyset` syntax. Uniques return up to 10,000 results. Check [`uniques`](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#func-uniques) and the [`keyset`](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#keyset). Here's a couple of query examples: 
  
  ```sql
  From PageAction select uniques(countryCode)
  ```

  ```sql
  From PageView select keyset() SINCE 1 day ago
  ```
  
* You can use almost any NRQL query as long as the `uniques` and `keyset` components return a list of values.
* Nested variables are not supported: there can't be variables within variables.

## Some examples [#examples]

Here are some different types of template variable implementations. 

<CollapserGroup>
<Collapser
    id="multi-value"
    title="Use multi-value option"
  >

You can enable the multi-value option from the display options section when creating a variable of type `NRQL/ENUM`.

Here's an example of a query that creates a variable named `{{MultiValue}}` and returns a list of all unique eventId's:

```sql
SELECT uniques(eventId) FROM AjaxRequest
```

<img
  width="30%;"
  title="Multi-value template variable example"
  alt="Multi-value template variable example"
  src={dashboardsAddMultiValue}
/>

Then you would create a widget with the following query:

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM AjaxRequest WHERE eventId IN ({{MultiValue}})
```

<img
  width="80%;"
  title="Creating a widget"
  alt="Creating a widget"
  src={dashboardsMultiValueAddWidget}
/>

</Collapser>
<Collapser
    id="multiple-variables"
    title="Use multiple variables for one widget"
  >

You can define only one template variable at a time, but you can use more than one template variable in a single widget. 

Here's an example of a query that uses two template variables. Note that this assumes the `countryCode` and `city` template variables would have already been created. 

```sql
SELECT countryCode, city FROM PageAction WHERE countryCode = {{countryCode}} and city = {{city}}
```
<img
  title="Creating a widget using multiple variables"
  alt="Creating a widget using multiple variables"
  src={dashboardsMultipleVariableAddWidget}
/>

</Collapser>
<Collapser
    id="variables-partial-match"
    title="Use variables and partial match"
  >

Using variables and [regex](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#func-capture), you can create a filter, provided you're sure that a part of the filter is fixed.

You need to use this partial match if you want to use `like`.

Let's say you want to filter by release version. The query returns something like: `release-1234`.

You can create a variable using [`aparse`](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#func-aparse) to parse the version number:

```sql
SELECT uniques(aparse(platformVersion , 'release-*')) FROM PageView 
```

<img
  width="40%;"
  title="Creating the release version variable"
  alt="Creating the release version variable"
  src={dashboardsAddVariablePartialMatch}
/>

Then create a widget with the following query:

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM PageAction WHERE aparse(platformVersion, 'release-*') IN ({{releaseversion}}) facet platformVersion
```

<img
  title="Creating the widget"
  alt="Creating the widget"
  src={dashboardsAddWidgetAparse}
/>


Or if you prefer, you could use the [`capture`](/docs/query-your-data/nrql-new-relic-query-language/get-started/nrql-syntax-clauses-functions/#func-capture) command:

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM PageAction WHERE capture(platformVersion, r'release-(?P<platformVersion>\d+)') IN ({{releaseversion}}) Facet platformVersion
```

<img
  title="Creating the widget"
  alt="Creating the widget"
  src={dashboardsAddWidgetCapture}
/>

</Collapser>
<Collapser
    id="variables-regex-like-rlike"
    title="Use variables and regex with LIKE / RLIKE"
  >

You can use `LIKE` and `RLIKE` as template variables to filter data in a dashboard. To use this feature, the value you add when creating the template variable must use the `%` wildcard symbols at the start and end of the value.

Here's an example. You define a string variable, as shown here:

<img
  width="40%;"
  title="Add `LIKE` as template variable"
  alt="Add `LIKE` as template variable"
  src={dashboardsDefineVariableLikeFilter}
/>

You can then create a widget chart and use your variable like this:

``` sql
FROM NrdbQuery SELECT user WHERE user LIKE {{like_filter}}
```

<img
  title="Add `LIKE` as template variable"
  alt="Add `LIKE` as template variable"
  src={dashboardsAddWidgetLikeFilter}
/>

or like this:

```sql
FROM NrdbQuery SELECT user WHERE user RLIKE {{like_filter}}
```

</Collapser>
<Collapser
    id="variables-dynamic-grouping"
    title={<>Use variable <InlineCode>facet</InlineCode> with a NRQL query</>}
  >

You can create a variable of type NRQL with a string output format and use it after a `facet` clause to group by different values. 

For example, you might create a variable named `{{userAgentName}}` that would look like:

```sql
SELECT uniques(userAgentName) FROM PageAction
```

<img
  width="30%;"
  title="Creating the variable"
  alt="Creating the variable"
  src={dashboardsAddVariableFacet}
/>

Then you'd create a widget with the following query:

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM PageAction WHERE userAgentName={{userAgentName}} FACET userAgentName
```

<img
  title="Creating widget using facet"
  alt="Creating widget using facet"
  src={dashboardsAddWidgetFacet}
/>

</Collapser>
<Collapser
    id="variables-dynamic-grouping"
    title="Use variables for dynamic grouping"
  >

You can create a variable with an `identifier` output format and use it after a `FACET` clause to group by different values.

For example, you might create a `{{location}}` variable of type list with two possible values: `countryCode` and `city`. You'd set the output format to `identifier`.

<img
  width="40%;"
  title="Adding the variable for dynamic grouping"
  alt="Adding the variable for dynamic grouping"
  src={dashboardsAddVariableDynamicGrouping}
/>

Then you'd create a widget with the following query:

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM PageAction FACET {{location}}
```

<img
  title="Adding the widget for dynamic grouping"
  alt="Adding the widget for dynamic grouping"
  src={dashboardsAddWidgetDynamicGrouping}
/>

</Collapser>
<Collapser
    id="variables-dynamically-change-percentile"
    title="Use variables to dynamically change the percentile"
  >

You can create a variable with output format `number` and use that inside a percentile function.

For example, you could create a `{{percentile}}` variable of type `list` with two possible values: `55` and `90`. You'd want to set the output format as `number`.

<img
  width="40%;"
  title="Adding the variable for dynamically change the percentile"
  alt="Adding the variable for dynamically change the percentile"
  src={dashboardsAddVariableDynamicPercentile}
/>

Then you'd create a widget with the following query:

```sql
SELECT percentile(duration,{{percentile}}) FROM PageAction
```

<img
  title="Adding the widget for dynamically change the percentile"
  alt="Adding the widget for dynamically change the percentile"
  src={dashboardsAddWidgetDynamicPercentile}
/>


</Collapser>
<Collapser
    id="variables-filter"
    title="Use variables to filter"
>

To use variables for filtering you only need to add the created variable on the right side of a `WHERE` clause, like this: 

```sql
SELECT countryCode, city FROM PageAction WHERE countryCode IN ({{countryCode}})
```

<img
  title="Use variables to filter"
  alt="Use variables to filter"
  src={dashboardsUseVariablesToFilter}
/>
